"Thank you. Thank you. I love New Jersey and I’m thrilled to be back right here in the Garden State. Thank you. The Garden State.
Together we’re achieving historic victories for New Jersey families. You see it every single day. The New Jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time. More people are working today in the state of New Jersey than ever before. I have to tell you more people, almost 160 million, are working right now in the United States. That’s the highest level of employment in the history of our country. A lot of countries aren’t doing so well, just so you understand.
 Tomorrow we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history, with the incredible brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. A massive win for New Jersey workers, New Jersey farmers, New Jersey union people, New Jersey manufacturers and everybody.
Weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs. $250 billion coming in. Oh that’s going to be so nice. We’re restoring America’s industrial might like never before. They’re all coming back. They want to be where the action is.
After years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military.
Thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors, the greatest warriors in the world, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder, and leader, al-Baghdadi is dead.
Weeks ago, at my direction, the US military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world’s number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans, and actively planning new attacks, but we stopped him cold. Yet Washington Democrats, like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous Nancy Pelosi, they opposed our action to save American lives. They oppose it. They oppose it. You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly? The legs, the arms, wiped out. No legs, no arms. Soleimani loved that. That was his weapon of choice. We didn’t like him. He’s not around anymore.
 Well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts, and deranged partisan crusades. It’s all they know how to do. The do nothing Democrats. They have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady, trying to overthrow the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election. We are going to have a victory that’s even greater than 2016. This November we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep The White House.
The American people are disgusted by the Washington Democrat … You see it. You see it. Which is worse, the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from Russia? But we’re going to be signing up millions and millions of registered Independents, Democrat voters. Today I had the best polls that I’ve ever had since being elected. The best we’ve ever had. Remember I used to go over polls? But I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise I wouldn’t. We had our best polls.
 Americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left Socialists. I never saw anything … What’s going on in this country … What’s going on in this country, really the Democrat party is the Socialist party and maybe worse. Voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the Republican party with wide open arms. The Republican party is doing great.
We are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the Democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism, enough of their Socialism, and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams. He’s had enough. I tell you he really is, he’s a brave guy. He just said, ” I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it. It’s a hoax, it’s a scam, I’m not doing it.” We called him, “You’re our kind of guy. Let’s go.” It didn’t take much because he believes like we do. We are truly honored to be here with the newest Republican member of the House of Representatives, your great congressman, Jeff Van Drew. I have to tell you a few weeks ago Jeff was one of the few brave and principled Democrat lawmakers, in all fairness we’ve been after him for a longtime, who stood up to the House Democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now. They can’t win an election so they’re trying to steal an election. It’s not happening folks. It’s not happening. Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party, and to stand tall in defense of our constitution, our freedom, and democracy itself. I just want to … I have to tell you, I’ve gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks. He’s a great guy, he’s a brave guy, he shares our values. He supports lower taxes, not bad. They want to raise your taxes.
How did that work Jeff? How did you get elected with that one?
Less regulation, a strong national defense. He loves our military, loves our vets, and police. He is a tireless champion for the state of New Jersey. He loves your second amendment, which is under siege by the Democrats.
 175? I think he’s on his way. I think he’s on his way. Thank you Jeff, great job. Thank you Jeff. Thank you Jeff.
 It’s been a little bit of a story. You see the fakers back there? Fake news. Fake. You know if another candidate has 1,000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd. If they have 10,000, like Pocahontas went into Central Park in New York. This young men could have 10,000 people, you know that, in Central Park. She had 10,000 people like in Central Park. I said, “What’s the big deal?” They made it, “Oh the crowds are so large.” Jeff just told you he had 175,000 people sign up. Seriously you have to see outside. They know because they have to follow, they’re trailers. I call them trailers. But they’re fake. They’re fake. They’re not honest.
Let me just tell you, so here’s the story, so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time. We have tens of thousands of people outside. They never mention it. They never mention it, so maybe they will tonight. But that’s an all-time record. This is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10,000 people or less. We set the all-time record. You know why? Because for games … See the floor packed with people? For games you’re playing ice hockey or basketball, so we broke the all-time record in this house. It’s a wonderful house in a wonderful community.
Also in Wildwood, like we’re in the middle of winter. There is nobody in the middle of winter and it’s a great place in the summer. Those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically. But on June 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor. Number one you have to get out and vote Republican. Get rid of these clowns. You have to get out and vote for really a brave man. What he did was incredible. Jeff Van Drew, what he did was incredible. Get out and vote. He’s going to have a big victory. He’s going to have a big victory.
 We’re grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine, people that I’ve known forever, your former governor who did a terrific job, Chris Christie. Chris. Great Chris, great job. Your wonderful Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt, what a job he’s doing. Thank you Doug. Thank you Doug.
My campaign’s two great New Jersey co-chairs and I think we’ll play for the state … You know they all say Republicans can’t win. Tell me why? They said, “Should you move this to the Meadowlands?” I said, “No, I want to be in South Jersey. We want to be with our friends.” But we could have filled up the Meadowlands arena two or three times. Maybe we’ll do it during the summer. Should we do it during the summer?
Maybe. But two brave guys, two great politicians. People that love our state. State senators Mike Testa and Joe Pennacchio. Joe Pennacchio. Thank you Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Two incredible New Jersey natives, you’ve never heard of Kellyanne Conway have you?
And Bill Stepien. say something.
Thank you Kellyanne.
 I just want to thank Republicans because what they’ve been doing is incredible. Republican leadership in this country we’re winning, winning, winning like never before. We’re winning again and we’ve got a party that’s a very different part, a much stronger party, a much more inclusive party. We have a party that we love. We have a party that has the votes. We have a party like they’ve never had before. The Republican party respected again.
I have to say this, America is winning again and America is thriving again like never before. Since the election we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration, listen to this one, in United States history. That’s a good fact, the lowest in history.
Thank you man. We have a great veteran up here and he said, “We love you. We love you.” The veterans. Are we doing good for the veterans? Thank you.
African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. Ever recorded! Women’s unemployment is at a 65 year low. Sorry about that. Soon it’s going to be historic. Another couple of good months it’ll be historic. 65 years for women.
 In the eight years before I took office over 300,000 working age people left the workforce. They had no choice. In just three years of my administration 3.5 million people have joined the workforce. Nobody believes it, including the fake …
The workforce. Nobody believes it including the fake news. If I would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this, the fakeness would have been hitting me. He’s exaggerating. He’s lying, Pinocchio, Pinocchio. The press is very dishonest. More than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% every year, which is a record. A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working, another record. Under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody. You don’t hear that because this is a blue collar boom.
It’s very nice. It’s about time. It’s about time. It’s been many, many decades. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%, first time ever. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased, listen to this, by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median household income is at an all time high. For President Bush, in eight years it was $450, over eight years. Think of this for a second. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, for eight years it was $975, so eight years, eight years, 450, 975 under your favorite President, and when you include the tax cuts, the regulation cuts that nobody’s ever cut taxes like this. Nobody’s ever cut regulations. That’s why all these jobs are being built. Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost $10,000, and that’s three years, and it’s going up. It’s going up very substantial. That’s a big difference.
 New business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high, and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare. They’re off. They are off federal welfare. Nobody would’ve believed these numbers. Someday they’re going to write the true story. Our child tax credit alone is delivering $2,200 a year to 40 million American families. We have ended, so importantly for you, the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We don’t need anybody else’s energy anymore. It’s so nice. What happened in the last three years with energy is incredible, but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down U.S. energy, including through the so-called Green New Deal.
Close your factories. Get rid of your cows. You don’t have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, they’re gone. We will never sacrifice America’s energy independence. Took us a long time to get there, and we really picked it up over the last three years. What we’ve done is incredible, pipelines all over. Pipelines are good. They’re underground, they’re good, environmentally sound. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most. These are the communities that really have suffered. We created, with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina, You know who I’m talking about? Tim Scott, right? Senator Tim Scott, he’s an incredible guy. He really is. He came to my office and he had this idea that he’s wanted to do for a long time. Senator Tim Scott, opportunity zones, and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey, all over the United States. Billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and not government dollars, they’re flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead.
For decades, politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers, but then they went to Washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash, and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries. They closed up your factories. They got rid of your jobs. They didn’t have to pay taxes. Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steal our farms and ransack our communities. Not anymore, not anymore, because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a President who puts America first. Is that okay?
The United States laws, listen to this number, and you know if it was wrong, the fake news would be all over me, and I’ve been saying it for three years. The United States lost 60,000 factories and plants. Think of that. You wouldn’t think that’s possible because of stupid trade deals, because of bad leadership. During the 16 years of the two prior administrations, under just three years, my administration has now added 12,000 new factories, and many more are being built and they’re pouring back into the United States, because that’s where the action is. That’s where they want to be. They are pouring back into our country, new plants and factories. You see them all over. I passed two of them coming in, brand new, beautiful plants and factories. They’re pouring back in. This is where the action is. This is where they want to be. I see the leaders, they say, “It’s incredible what happened to your country.” I said, “Don’t tell me that. We want you to have your companies build plants in New Jersey and other places,” and that’s what’s happening.
But on no issue have Washington Democrats thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration. Left-wing, radical, politician support deadly sanctuary cities, and remember, a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody. Instead, they order them to be released into your community. What the hell is going on? What is going on? Once set loose, these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent Americans. Right here in New Jersey, your state’s Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community.
For example, Cumberland County, we all know Cumberland County very well, right? Good luck with this one. They released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child. He is now at large, free to search for another innocent victim. They didn’t want to give him to ICE, and I want to thank ICE, because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do. Right here, another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey. The sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ICE request to detain him. Local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder. I could read these cases, honestly, I could read and state these cases to you all night. I could state these cases to you all night. No American should ever be hurt, harmed or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter… Look, look, wait. You have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail. You have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from. By the way, ICE has removed thousands upon thousands of MS-13 gang members, the most brutal people. You don’t want to do that job. Maybe you do, a couple of tough people up there. Anybody want to be with ICE? You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey. New Jersey is different. I think New Jersey is different.
No, but these ICE people, they love our country. They’re proud and they’re tough people, and they’ll go right into a pack. They call it a pack and they start swinging. Everyone’s swinging or they end up standing up. That’s the end of that, and you know what they do? They bring the MS-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador, back to Honduras, back to Guatemala, back to Mexico. I want to thank Mexico because you know what’s happening, right? Thousands and thousands at this moment, 27,000 soldiers from Mexico, protecting our Southern border. I want to thank the President.
Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice, and say what you want, but those are the facts. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members. We are literally taking them by so many, thousands and thousands, and we’re bringing him back. Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row. We have the numbers down by 75% since spring, 75%. We have ended catch and release and really, look, I had another party. I could get anything. If I wanted to spend money on anything, look with the military, we got two trillion dollars, right? More. Two trillion, all made in America, right? Everything. Best planes, best missiles, best everything, made in America. If I wanted to build anything, the only thing they put the whole weight of their party, they didn’t want us to have the wall. They knew it worked. Many of them voted five years ago for a wall. They just didn’t know how to get it built. I do. But what happened is through a series of court cases and other things, the money has won, and we are now building that beautiful wall, and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall, and by next year, we’ll be over 400 miles, and shortly thereafter it will be complete.
A lot of people were saying a year ago, “He didn’t build the wall yet. He didn’t build the wall.” Let me tell you. When you have the strength of a party that has the House, okay, hopefully they’re not going to have the House for long. We’ll have a wonderful new speaker, will get rid of Nancy Pelosi, nervous Nancy, nervous Nancy. We’ll have Kevin McCarthy who’s been fantastic. We have to win back the House. But think of this. The wall, so many people were saying, “Build it.” Well, it’s not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the House, not easy. We did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military, the Army Corps of Engineers anyway, but you know what? Now we actually have the money and it’s going up very rapidly.
In all due respect to Mexico, we like Mexico very much, and we’ve gotten along great with Mexico, and the President’s a friend of mine, and I think he’s doing a fantastic job. It’s a tough situation. But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall. Okay? They’d hit you with that. Now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and it’s an advantage for Mexico, too, when you think about it. The wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities. What we’re doing is stopping drugs at a record number. It’s still anything that comes over is too much, but we’re blocking it at a record number.
 I’m also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration. We will now be finally able to enforce federal law, and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs. They were killing our country, killing our country. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. Frankly, they’re crazy. These people are crazy. They’re taking their cues from socialists like Bernie. Left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans, which many people like. The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies. We have them working at the companies, and we have people getting great health care. It’s been so long. It’s finally working and they want to destroy it. The Republican party will never let it happen. We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care, take away your doctors, take away all of the good care that we fought, and we fought hard, and we’re doing well and now we’re doing better. By the way, some time prior to the end of the year, we’re putting in for a new middle income tax cut, a very big one. But we’re making health care better and much, much cheaper. We’ve done a great job in running it and we’ve given you a lot of alternatives. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party, pre-existing conditions, we saved it. We are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent. That’s a big deal, and that will take effect starting in about two months from now. Everything’s transparent. You’ll be able to see pricing. You’ll be able to go and price other hospitals, other doctors. It’s going to be an incredible thing. Nobody believes I was able to do it, but we did it.
We are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice. We are lowering drug prices. The Democrats are increasing drug prices. We are fighting the lobbyists and special interests. We are serving you and how are we doing? We’re doing good, right? But because of price transparency, we are getting it done. We’re approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country. That means they come in, frankly, they’re just as good as the big names, but they sell for 80% less in some cases. We are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds. We are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers. These are all things that we had to fight like hell to get.
We’re making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records, which is a big deal for a lot of people. We are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs. You go home, you say, “Oh, I’m feeling better. The doctor was fantastic,” and then they send you a bill for $25,000. That’s the end of that. All of a sudden the doctor wasn’t so good, right? We are making companies compete for your business. We are repealing burdensome taxes. We have accomplished more than any President in the first three years of their term by far, not even close.

We have provided health insurance options, 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease, HIV, pediatric cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. We’re making so much progress. We have just passed a thing that I think is great. I never understood. For 45 years, they’ve been trying to get it passed. We’ve just passed a thing called Right to Try. You know what that is? So, we have the greatest doctors, the greatest technicians, the greatest labs in the world, and we’ll have a drug that’s looking good, but it’s going to take five more years, and by the way, we’ve brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that, but it takes years to get it approved. You have people that are terminally ill. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help. If they don’t have money, they go home and they die. What we did is a thing called Right to Try.

People sign something and they don’t hold the country responsible. They don’t hold the drug company responsible. It’s called Right to Try, and they get the newest, and the best, and the latest medicine where it’s looking good, but you’re not going to have it for five more years, and you know why they didn’t do it? Because they didn’t want to hurt anybody, except the problem is the people were going to die soon. I said, “They’re terminally ill. Let them have it.” We sat down with a great group of leaders, Republican leaders, and honestly, we had some bipartisan support and we got it done. They’ve been tried to do it for 45 or so years. We got it done.

You have to see the results, and I’ve seen some of the results. Some of the results are incredible. We’ve transformed veteran’s health care, including through VA choice, right? VA choice. For 48 years they’ve been trying to get veterans choice. I thought I had the greatest secret. You know, I haven’t been doing this that long, so four years ago, I’m campaigning for president. Everyone said, “No, he’s only having fun.” Yeah, it’s some fun. This is a lot of fun. Right? But for 45 years-
 But for 45 years they’ve been trying to get it Veteran’s Choice. So I come back one day, I say to my people, “I have the greatest idea. I am so smart.” I am like the smart- I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online. They’re waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks. Some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors, too long. And I said, “Folks, I have the greatest idea.” All of my people, I say, “I have the greatest idea. I’m so smart. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to send all those people that can’t see a doctor, we just can’t get them to see a doctor. We’re going to send them down the road to private doctors and we’re going to pay the bill and they’re going to get fixed up.”

Right? So smart. But you see, I said I was smart and they looked back at me and they said, “Sir, we’ve known about that concept for 45 years. We just can’t get it approved.”

But I got it approved. And I got it approved about 11 months ago. And the VA is doing fantastically well. Our veterans are doing great. That was a big thing. That was a big thing. We also got accountability. Where people could mistreat our veterans, do whatever they want, they could be sadistic. They could be so many other things. They could steal, they could rob. You couldn’t do anything, you’d keep them. You couldn’t do a thing. We got accountability. Now you look at him, you say, “Get the hell out of here. You’re fired, you’re fired.

Now you can fire. They’ve let go of more than 8,000 bad people. We have reduced opioid deaths for the first time, and very substantially, in 30 years. And we are modernizing critical vaccines. We’re doing a great job with vaccines. We are creating a pathway to buy drugs from Canada, that are much, much cheaper, in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis came to me. He said, “Sir, this system is so bad.” And you can’t fix it unless you have democrat votes, that’s why you got to vote the house. You got to get us back the house.

They say, “Sir, we can buy the drugs in Canada for 50% less.” The same drug made in the same factory, made by the same company. 50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in Florida, or Colorado, or New Jersey, or wherever you are. This has been going on for a long time. No president has wanted to do it. You know how long it took me to make that decision? I said, “If you can say 50%, or 25%, or 15% buy it. Do it. Go.” And I gave him authorization, “Do it.”
 
We are protecting Medicare for our nation’s seniors. Democrats want, and you know this, Democrats want to raid Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.

And you know, we all have a heart. We all have a heart, but when you tell people to come into our country, like this clown governor of California, come into our country. They’re all going to come. If they think they’re going to get free education, free healthcare, they’re all going to come. If you don’t say it, they’re not going to come. Because who would even think this?

Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb, right up until the moment of birth. And that is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.

Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. Look at what’s happening to their cities. Los Angeles, it’s so sad. What you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don’t take care of the homeless. San Francisco, starting in New York. You could take a look at what’s happening to our cities run by Democrats. It’s a disaster. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream.

Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. That’s what it is. It’s one of the greatest moments. It’s probably the greatest movement in history.

The 2016 election was probably, I mean you could say, the greatest election in the history of our country.
And now we have to do it again to keep it going. It’s like a giant tree, you plant it, but it takes time to grab on. We need this next election so badly. The good news is, it’s much easier, because here I’ve done it all. I’ve achieved more than I promised. I never told you about Space Force. We got Space Force. I never told you about all of these things that we got. We are a big tent party in the true idea. It’s big ideas, and we have a big future together.

This country has tremendous potential, if we don’t blow it. To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we pass bi-partisan, criminal justice reform. They came to me, they couldn’t get it done, including many conservatives. And these people that I fight every day, they came to me, “Help, help, help. Criminal justice reform.” I got it done. As soon as I got it done, they don’t even want to mention my name. I got it done. I got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten. President Obama tried, he couldn’t get it done. President Bush couldn’t get it. They couldn’t get it done. That’s okay. They couldn’t get it done. I got it done. I got it done.
And after I got it done, and I mean solely got it done, and after I got it done they had news conferences. They’re thanking people that I never even heard of. The only one they didn’t think was President Trump. And I got it done, but that’s the way it is. That’s why I always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it.

We’re fighting to give school choice to every child in America who needs it. During National School Choice Week, we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. School Choice, very important. Democrats don’t want that.

To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And two great Supreme court justices, two great ones.

As we rebuild our military, we have authorized over $160 million to support our warriors at a place called, huh, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix. Have you ever heard of those places? Have you ever heard of those places, New Jersey? $ 160 million, two great places.

I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else was going to do it. They’ve been trying to do that one for 52 years.

For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Jersey. My friends.

At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. I really mean that, it’s the survival of our nation. And if you would have had the other party winning this last election, instead of your market being up 72%. Instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can’t even believe where your wife or your husband says, “Darling, you’re the most brilliant person in history. For years, you’ve been losing your ass with 401ks. Now you’re making a fortune.” Right? Right?

Now you’re making a fortune. I have people coming up to me all the time. I had one gentlemen come up, “Sir. Thank you, sir. You’ve made me look so smart. My wife never respected me for anything, not anything. But now she thinks I’m a great investor. Thank you.” 401k.

If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for it to secure, then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020. We have to.

And by the way, when we talk about inheriting victory in 2020 in our Nation, just so you understand, under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history, guess what you have? You have a business, you have a farm, you have a small business, no more inheritance tax, no more what we call death tax.
So if you love your children, they won’t have to mortgage the plant. They won’t have to be mortgage the farm, as the expression goes. They won’t have to mortgage anything, there’s no tax. If you don’t love your children, don’t leave it to them and then you do have a problem. No, I’m only kidding. Does anybody here not love their child or their children? Because if you don’t… There’s one man raising his hand. Nah, that’s a big thing. No more estate tax, no more death tax for your small farms and business. Those are things that people don’t even realize.

Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I never even knew the swamp was this bad. Swamp is bad, bad people. A lot of bad people in the swamp.
Bad people in the swamp.
We got a lot of bad people in that swamp. That swamp, the swamp creatures they call them. They are a [ 00:11:35]. Step by step [ 00:55:39] you thought this was going to be easy, right? A lot of bad people.

With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening together in our [ 00:55:55].

Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. That’s what’s happening now. We will enact trade deals, the greatest deals ever made. That result in more product proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase “Made in the USA.” Beautiful.

For decades we had politicians that didn’t care about that phrase. That phrase didn’t mean anything to them.

We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic, can you believe this, in America in 10 years or less. We’ve already started the process. And it could have been started sooner by the past administration, they chose not to do it. I chose to do it. Think of that, ending the AIDS epidemic within 10 years that we’ve started.

We will defend privacy, free speech, religious Liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms, which is under seige.
By the way, our second amendment is under siege. In Virginia, they want to take your guns away. It’s just the beginning. Never going to happen as long as I’m President of the United States. That I can tell you.

But above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American ways. And we believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.
And we will always live by the words of our national motto, In God, We Trust.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you, very much, everybody.

From Morristown to Vineland, and Patterson to Pennington. From Camden to Clifton, all the way down the shore to Ocean City and Sea Isle and Stone Harbor. And right here in Wildwood, New Jersey.
This has always been the home of the proud, loyal, and very, very incredible Americans. And my friends, so many people in this group, I know them well. They’re tough. They’re smart, they’re great people. It’s called Jersey.

This is the state that pioneered the boardwalk, the diner, and the motion picture. And gave the world American greats like Thomas Edison and Frank Sinatra, old blue eyes.

Frank Sinatra. He was a piece of work, that I can tell you. New Jersey is the state where George Washington led a die hard band of American patriots to victory at Trenton, and Princeton, and Monmouth. In our glorious battle to win American independence, George Washington. This is the state where generations of tough and strong New Jersey craftsmen and dock hands, farmers and factory workers built this country into the single greatest nation on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater and greater every day. It will never be better than what’s coming. There’ll never be anything like what we’re doing.
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people.
With your help and your devotion, with your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, place I love, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. New Jersey. Thank you. Thank you.",28/1/20
" I worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard. You just got two of the greatest trade deals, and add Japan to it, by the way. Let’s make it three, 40 billion from Japan, USMCA, all done. China, all done for the farmers. It’s done, that I can tell you. You’re going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land. You’ve got to produce a lot of product. I don’t know if you can, but, hello Des Moines. It’s great to be with you. I’m thrilled to be back in American heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Great people. This November we’re going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street.

I mean, I don’t even know. I just saw, New York Times, can you believe? Failing New York Times… When we leave in 10, 14, 18, 22 years from now, the New York Times will be out of business and so will a lot of others. But, did you see they did a New York Times poll, I think, and Sienna, Sienna, New York Times of Iowa, and they have me pitted against every one of the Socialists, and we’re winning by a lot. Everyone. We’re beating them all. We’re beating them all. We’re beating them all. We’re beating them like they haven’t been beaten before. You know all the noises about their crazy debates, nobody’s watching their debates, but it’s all about their debates. They don’t care about the farmer. Everything out here, they love Trump, and you should love Trump with what I’ve done.

So, we’re going to win the great state of Iowa and it’s going to be a historic landslide. If we don’t win, your farms are going to hell. I can tell you right now. Sell, sell, they’ll be saying “Sell.” No, we love the farmers, and we love the ranchers, and we love the manufacturers, frankly. You got plenty of that too in this state. The great state, and you have a great governor, by the way. You have a great governor.

But every day we’re achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the Hawkeye State. The Iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history. That’s not bad. That’s not bad. Oh, let’s vote for Pocahontas. Let’s vote for Bernie. Let’s vote for sleepy Joe. He’s falling asleep. Joe, Joe, Joe. He always gets the name wrong. How many times has he missed it? He’s in Iowa. He says, “Great to be in the great state of Ohio.” They say, “Joe, you’re in Iowa.” You can’t do that. No matter how great you speak. If you’re Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech, it’s over. You might as well just wrap it up. There’s the fake news. They would just absolutely destroy you. They would absolutely destroy you.

You can’t do that. You can’t do that, Joe, sleepy Joe, but you have these guys. You have these people. How about Buttigieg? Buttigieg. They call him mayor Pete. You know why? Because nobody can pronounce his name. Nobody has any idea. Buttigieg. They say, “Say edge edge.” He presides over a city that’s failed. It’s doing so badly, in a state that’s having the greatest year they’ve ever had, and they have a great governor also, and they had a great governor. You just heard from him, right? The great state of Indiana, so I don’t see that one. Go down the line. We have some people. Let’s not talk about them. What happened to mini Mike? Where is he? He’s not running. He’s skipping four or five states. Mini Mike. I’ve had him up to here.

More people are working right now in Iowa than ever before. Now think of it. Think of it. Yesterday we replaced a NAFTA disaster with the incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement. The USMCA, you know when you have a hard time with that one, memory is a great thing. I’ve always had a great memory for whatever reason, but memory is a great thing. Having a great memory, but sometimes you take little clues. USMCA. Thank you, darling. I love you, too. Where is that person up? Look at that. Wow. What a good, strong voice.

But you know how you remember it? The song I just walked in on. They’re playing the song YMCA. So, when you’re having a hard time, gee, what’s U-S, just think of the song YMCA, and you’ll remember it, USMCA. It’s a massive win for Iowa farmers and workers of all kinds. It’s a massive win and it creates some fairness with Canada. It creates fairness with Mexico. Probably the biggest reason that I ran was the unfair trade that I’ve seen, and one after one, China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, we’ve made all these deals, and we have plenty left over. Plenty left over. Europe, Europe, Europe is next. I wanted to finish China before we started on Europe. I like to do them one at a time, one at a time. I’m a very organized person.

But weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with China that will boost American agriculture by $50 billion every year, and many other businesses like manufacturing, banking, finance, overall $250 billion, and you know with the farmers, because I have a place in my heart for the farmers big. I went and I saw Ambassador Lighthizer’s in charge, he’s fantastic. I said, “What are you doing? We’re getting ready for the final deal. What are you doing?” He said, “I’m putting in $20 billion.” Because I asked Sonny Perdue. He’s great. You know who he is, right? Secretary of Agriculture. I said, “Sonny, what’s the biggest number that China’s ever done with the farmers?” He said, “Sir, $16 billion last year. $16 billion.” This was two years ago. I said, “So, $16 billion is the biggest,” because you know, they targeted you, and now we’re friends with China.

In fact, maybe we’ve never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the Coronavirus. We’re working with them very, very closely. We only have five people. Hopefully everything’s going to be great. They have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully it’s all going to be great. But, we’re working with China just so you know, and other countries very, very closely, so it doesn’t get out of hand, but it’s something that we have to be very, very careful with, right? We have to be very careful.
 But I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” 16 and 12 the year before, and you were targeted. I don’t blame China. Look, they’re smart. They’re negotiators. They targeted Trump states. Where do they love Trump? They love him in Iowa. They love him in Nebraska. They love him in all these states. They love him in Wisconsin. They love him. We won Wisconsin. They like him and Wisconsin, and a lot of the farm states, and they targeted. The farmers came to see me and they said, “Sir, you have to do what’s right.” When the fake news would interview farmers, the farmers would say, “No, no, President Trump is doing the right thing. It should have been done years ago. Should’ve been done years and years ago.” But you couldn’t have made it because there was too much money, $16 billion. So, what I did is I put a 25% tariff on everything coming in from China, $250 billion, and then more tariffs on things beyond the $250 billion market. We took in billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. We still are, and then what happened? When I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers, they were in the White House. They came to see me. I had 36 farmers and I said, “I’m going to give you.” They said, “Sir, we don’t want anything.” I said, “What do you mean you don’t want anything? I’ve never heard that before.” Everybody wants money. They want every. They said, “We just want a level playing field.” I never forgot it. They said, “We don’t want anything. We just want a level playing field, and we’ve been treated badly for years, for years.”

I said, “Well, you haven’t been given a level playing field for many, many years, for decades. You haven’t been given a level playing field. We’re going to give you the levelest field that you ever had. But, but in the meantime, I’m going to give you $12 billion, out of these tens of billions that we’re collecting.” Don’t worry. We had plenty of left over, because we never got 25 cents from China. China took from us. We didn’t take from China, right? I said, “I’m going to give you $12 billion for the year before, and I’m going to give you $16 billion for this year.” That was last year for this year. So, they got, meaning you, a lot of you in this audience, got $12 billion, and you got 16, so you got $28 billion over that short period of time, and you were able to actually, in some cases, I guess thrive. I told Sonny, “I want to take care of the small farmer too, not just the big monsters. I want to take care of everyone, everyone.”

But, I never forgot when CNN fake news and all these people, they go around interviewing the farmers. They could never find anyone saying bad about Trump. They’d go into diners. “What do you think about Trump? Isn’t it a terrible what he’s doing with the trade?” The farmer would say, “No, he’s doing what should have been done 20 years ago.” Now, you people are going to make so much money. You’re not going to do just, you know what? Just relax. Take it easy. Put it away. Enjoy your life. But you’re going to make a lot of money. You’re going to make a lot of money. Again, we have never had, because they respect us now, they didn’t respect us. We have never had a better relationship with China than we do right now. It’s a beautiful story. They respect us. The whole world respects us now. We’re respected again. America is respected again. Okay?

We’re fighting for products made in America and grown right here in this great, great state of Iowa. To keep America safe, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. It’s now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before. We have all brand new equipment and it was all built in the USA. Thanks to the courage of American heroes, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader, the animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead.

Crazy Nancy Pelosi said, “Don’t call him an animal. He’s a human being.” No, he’s an animal. He’s an animal. Two weeks ago, at my direction, the United States military delivered another historic win for American justice. Our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. Qasem Soleimani. He was the mastermind of the road side bomb. He loved roadside bombs. When you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries, frankly, walking around, they don’t have legs, they don’t have arms in some cases. Some cases they don’t have both. You see them walking around, or riding around, or the most brave people, these people have the greatest attitude. I go to Walter Reed and I see him and the young man his legs were blown off. “How you doing?” “Sir, I want to get back. I want to get back, sir.” I’ll tell you, the spirit of these people, it may even top the farmers. It may even top the farmers, which is pretty good.

But he was responsible, more than anybody else, 90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us, he was responsible and he took a hard hit. He took a very hard hit. He was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of Americans, and hundreds of thousands of other people. Not acceptable. Soleimani was actively planning new attacks, but we ended his bloody rampage forever.

Yet, Washington Democrats, true, like crazy Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, opposed our decision to eliminate Soleimani, and to save American lives. That had a tremendous impact. While we’re proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists, Congressional Democrats are consumed with partisan rage, and obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax. You know, we’re having probably the best years that we’ve ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people? I got impeached. They impeached Trump. The best trade deals, the strongest military, I took care of the vets. We got choice. We got accountability for the vets, accountability. We got all these things and they impeach your President. No, that’s not going to work. Watch, just watch.

They want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow the entire system of government. That’s not happening, I can tell you that. Washington Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election. Why am I not worried? I should worried. Remember Nixon, it was like a dark period, right? It’s a very dark period. It was like oh, you think about it. Right? With Clinton it was not good. They say that with Johnson, it was a long time ago, none of us remember, but they say it was a very dark period. This is a happy period for us. It’s a happy period. It’s a happy period because we call this impeachment light. This is light.

Crazy Schiff. Shifty Schiff. He’s a sick puppy. He’s a sick puppy. But, you know what? Today you saw it, I hit my highest poll numbers since I got elected because the American people, and frankly, people all over the world, know it’s a hoax. They understand it. They know it’s a hoax, and we have a great party, the Republican party. They know what’s going on. They know what’s going on and they’re going to treat us very fairly. But, the Democrats are trying to overturn the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in 2020.

November 3, November 3, mark it off. November 3, mark it off. Was that a great day? 2016 November. Remember? He’s not going to do well with this group. I did well. He’s not going to do well with that group. I won that group. He’s not going to do well here or there. Even the exit polls, they took it right up. You know what they didn’t know about the exit polls? When people are leaving, they’re always very accurate. People leave. “Who you voted for?” “I voted for Trump.” “Who you voted for?” “I voted for crooked Hillary. I don’t care that she’s a stone cold crook. I’m voting for her.” Who are you voting for? I’m voting for Trump, or Clinton, or Trump. They’re always very accurate, but this time something happened.
Many people, many… I like that idea. I like it. I like it. Wouldn’t we like to run against her. who’s tougher? Her, crazy Bernie, Biden, Buttigieg? Who would be the closest? Buttigieg. I don’t know. Maybe we take another crack at crazy Hillary. Would that be okay? She was so easy. Remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorables. Remember? Remember deplorables? But you know the only thing I didn’t understand, I said, “That’s terrible.” But she said another word that was worse. Irredeemables. I said, “Boy,” shows you how good I am at politics, I said, “She’s in trouble. She said our people are irredeemable.” To me that was worse. Well, it wasn’t that word that caught on. It was deplorable. The next day I’m speaking, and women are walking around, I’m deplorable. Everyone’s got deplorable. I say, “I think she made a bad speech last night.” But irredeemable, remember? She called them deplorable and irredeemable, and me being so brilliant, I said, “I think that irredeemables going to get her.” No, deplorable got her. A lot her like lack of ability.

Together we are going to win back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep that beautiful, gorgeous, incredible White House. People don’t realize this is a lot of work. I just left Michigan, and Michigan is booming now because of me, meaning, my people. I say to Prime Minister Abe, he’s a friend of mine, “Shinzo,” Japan, “You got to do something. You got these massive deficits for our country. You got to open up plants in Michigan fast, Shinzo. Fast. You’ve got to do it.” “Yes, I will do it.” He’ll do it, and he’s doing it. Countries are coming in from all over the world. They’re going to Michigan. They’re coming to Iowa. They’re buying your stuff again, like crazy, like crazy.

They’re going to Ohio. They’re going to Pennsylvania. They’re going to South Carolina. They’re going to North Carolina. They’re going to Florida. They’re coming in like never before. They’re all coming back. I ran on the issue trade. I ran on a lot of different issues, but trade was one of them. That was so big. To me, it was so big. I used to say, how do we allow these companies to close, fire everybody, go to another country? Mexico, wherever it may be, make product, sell the product into our country, pay no tax. Who the hell would allow this to happen? Who would allow to happen?
 It’s like in South Korea. I went to him, I said, “Listen, your deal is no good. We have to make a new deal.” South Korea, we’re protecting them all, all these different things. I said, “Number one, you’ve got to pay us more.” They agreed to. They gave us $500 million a year more. They said, “But nobody has ever asked.” They gave us 500. That’s nothing compared to what they have to do. That’s okay. That’s okay. They’ll pay more. But you know, they made a trade deal with the United States. Hillary Clinton was in charge of the deal, right? She said it’s going to produce 250,000 jobs, and she was right. 250,000. You know who it was for? For South Korea, not for us, it was for South Korea. So, we renegotiated the deal, if I have your permission, we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with South Korea, okay?

This deal is going to produce, remember… This deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for South Korea. She didn’t lie. Can’t say she lied. She lies about a lot of other things, but she didn’t lie. How is she taking her defeat? Okay? I think so. Remember the debate? Do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and I sort of, I didn’t exactly say yes. I didn’t say yes, in all fairness, but I got sort of like six the 68% there. But she said, “See he won’t.” She’s the one that doesn’t do it. No, no, I feel badly because it’s too late for her to get in. I kept hoping, but I think, honestly I think that sleepy Joe, crazy Bernie, I don’t even want to put Buttigieg in, but I think they’d actually be tougher than her.

During this campaign season, the good people of Iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left. This is a radical left people that we’re dealing with. Today’s Democrat party, I don’t say Democratic party, it sounds so much better in a speech, right? Democratic party, the Democrat, but that’s not their name. It’s called the Democrat party. You know some people aren’t allowed to say the Democrat party because it doesn’t sound good. I don’t even like it. I don’t like the way it sounds in this speech, but I’m going to say it because I’m not looking to have them look good.

Today’s Democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid Medicare, shut down American energy, destroy your social security, they will destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate America’s children with hateful, left-wing ideology. Other than that, they’re okay. Other than that, they’re fine people. In short, this election is a choice between American freedom and Democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, it’s worse than Socialism. Socialism’s a kind word by comparison. The Democrats will lose because America will never be a socialist country. We can’t. They’re all watching tonight. They’re sitting in their hotel room, little hotels right down the street, and they’re looking at this crowd. The press never talks about my crowds. Did you see in New Jersey a couple of nights ago? We had signups for 175,000 people. We had an arena that held about 9,000 people. We could have sold it out 15 times. Okay? They don’t talk about that. You know what they talk about? They said Donald Trump who spoke before a nice crowd. If Bernie or sleepy Joe has, I mean Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table. No, it’s true. No, they were in a gymnasium. There were in a gymnasium, and they set up a round table, and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked, “What do you think of socialism?” They just said, “I just want to be here to watch his speech.” They set up a round-

They just said, “I just want to be here to watch a speech.” They set up a round table because the crowd was so small, and then they’ll say, “It was a brilliant round table. It was wonderful.” They never mention crowds. They never mention crowds. They never mention anything. I’ll tell you, U.S.M.C.A, The biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. Okay? It is, wait. It barely got any mention. We signed it. It barely got any mention. They talk about the impeachment hoax. They talk about all the other stuff, but the trade deal, that is going to change our country. It’s going to bring growth. Wait until you see, toward the end of next year, the growth will be astronomical because of the China Trade Deal, the U.S.M.C.A, Japan, South Korea, Europe, when that happens. It will happen because they have no choice. They have no choice.

But in the papers, and on the fake news cable shows, and the regular, look, NBC is horrible, the NBC Nightly News, it’s terrible. The good news is people don’t watch it like they used to, because they don’t believe in it. They don’t believe in it. And as Sean Hannity would say, MSDNC, you know what MSDNC is, right, so bad. CNN, total fake stuff. Oops, their camera just went off. Look! The camera just went off! CNN!

Their camera just went off. That always happens whenever I say CNN, their camera goes off.

But Americans, across the political spectrum, were disgusted by the Washington Democrats, the partisan hoaxes, the witch hunts, the con jobs. It’s all a con job. And so, they don’t love our country, I swear they don’t. You look at Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco. It was so beautiful, and now it’s a disgrace, being watched all over the world. Needles all over the place, everything else all over the place. I’m not going to get into it, washing down into the ocean, washing down onto their beaches, people living in tents if they’re lucky. I mean you never saw anything, living on their most important entryways into what was a great city, San Francisco. What’s happened? And all she does is work on the hoax and work on all of the stuff.

Really, these people are very, very bad for our country. We have to take back the House of Representatives, we have to.

Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat party in droves, and we are welcoming these people, and these great voters, to the Republican Party with wide, open arms.

And we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders, a lot of your really wonderful people. I’m not going to mention all the names, because all those cameras that are rolling, they don’t like it when I do it, but one they don’t mind is Governor Kim Reynolds. Come up, Kim, come up here! Also first gentleman, Kevin Reynolds, Kevin!

Great, great job. Thank you.
“No, no. We want ethanol.” Then, “we want biofuel.” Then she is asking for things I never even heard of, but we got them all, whatever that hell she wanted, we got. Right? And by the way, Joni Ernst and the great Chuck Grassley are right now in Washington fighting for fairness, fighting the hoax, fighting for all of us. They called, they said, “Do you mind if we don’t go tonight? We have to stay.” I said, “I don’t want you to be there. I want you to be where you are” because they are fighting for us. They are great people. They are great people.
And, they would call too. Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, they would call, “We got to help our farmers, sir.”

“Yes. Okay, we are going to help the farmer.” They were great. Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg. Thank you, Adam. Thank you, Adam. Great job, Adam. Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, a man with really fantastic genes, got to have like the best genes in the world. Although you had an ex-governor here that had very good genes, too. We have his son in the audience, too, but this is Representatives Pat Grassley. Those genes, those two young men have the greatest genes anyone has ever had for politics. Thank you, fellas, thanks. I sent one of them, the father to China, and he’s now Ambassador to China. Do you think he is happy? Is he happy? I think so. I think he is happy. Great Governor, longest serving Governor in history, actually, 24 years. We have the Chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, Jeff Kaufmann. Great job.

And just quickly, we have the world’s tallest campaign manager, Brad Parscale. And Republican National Committee Co-Chair, who has done an incredible job, Tommy Hicks. And we have the great negotiator, the great man, Bob Lighthizer with us here, someplace. Where’s Bob? What a job he did negotiating for you.

And we have somebody that you never heard of, somebody that’s a fantastic person, but you never heard of, somebody named Sarah Sanders. Have you ever heard of her? Come here, Sarah! Come on! That’s pretty good! And we have a great football player, from Iowa, Matt Whitaker is here, Matt. Say something.
And Mr. President, how much do we love the state of Iowa, so much. This is an incredibly special place, I actually met my husband here in Des Moines, so I love being back in Iowa. It is an amazing place. We’re sorry you have had so many crazy, liberal Democrats running around here the last year. But the good news is, it’s not going to matter, because at the end of the day, this guy will still be our president.
Thank you, Sarah. Very popular. She is a terrific person, great person. Thanks to Republican leadership, American now has the hottest economy anywhere on the Planet Earth, not even close. Every Prime Minister, President, King, Queen, Dictator, whatever you want to call them, they all say, “How did you do it?” And, the truth is we have certain advantages, but we also have a people advantage. We have the greatest people in the world. I really mean that.
Since the election, we have created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. Can you believe that? The lowest unemployment rate. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded, think of that.

More than two million millennials, you know what millennials are, young, great people with a lot of future, they have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5% annually. That’s a record.

Another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34, people are now working, and that’s a record, the number of people, 25 to 34.

And under the so-called Trump Economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group. And that’s a great thing. This is a blue collar boom, and that’s a good thing too. That’s a good thing.

Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever, for the first time ever.

And median household income is at an all time high, just for one second, president Bush, eight years, $450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, eight years, $975. President Donald John Trump, two and a half years, not three, because the numbers were taken at two and a half, now it’s actually higher. Two and a half years, including the tax cuts which are massive, and including all of the regulatory cuts, and the other things you have gotten, $10,000. Think of it.

You have eight years, 450. Eight years, 975. Two and a half years, think of it, $10,000. It’s one of the reasons the economy is doing so well. And let the people down the road tell you about that, okay? Let them tell you about that. And those tractors that I told you to buy, your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it. They will be 60 years old. They will be old, tired, exhausted. Your land will be exhausted. You will be exhausted.

We’ve ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far. We are also proudly promoting American ethanol, and I recently approved E15 to be used all year round! Biofuel also, but the Socialist Democrats want to shut down American energy. They support Representative Ocasio-Cortez.
It’s a real beauty. That’s a real beauty. That’s a beauty. I can’t even believe it, but I don’t want to knock it, because the Green New Deal, which would crush our farms, destroy our wonderful cows. I love cows. They want to kill our cows. You know why, right? You know why?
Don’t say it. They want to kill our cows. That means you are next. And they want to wipe out, totally, Iowa ethanol. They want to wipe it out. But we will never let that side get in, and by the way, that’s the least of it. But I don’t want to attack the Green New Deal, because they might change it.
 I said to her the other day, they said, “What do you think of the Green New Deal?” I said, “Well, it should be studied carefully. We should look at it, look at it closely. I don’t want to talk about until about two months before the election. And then I will tell you how totally insane it is.”
 How about this crazy Senator? How about this crazy, crazy Senator from Hawaii? They said, “I’m totally in favor,” not the smartest. She said, “I’m totally in favor of the Green New Deal.” Well, that would mean there’s no more airplanes. “Oh!” They started screaming at her in Hawaii, they said, “How the hell are we going to get to Hawaii?” They said, “We’re going to build a railroad.” She said that would be “the world’s longest track.” It’s the world’s longest. She doesn’t know that they don’t want airplanes anymore, and yet they fly around in brand new Gulfstreams, in brand new planes all over the place. They’re flying from place to place. They’re talking about the carbon footprint. “We’re going to destroy the carbon footprint! What time is my plane taking off, please?”
 To lift up forgotten communities, the Republican tax cut launched Opportunity Zones, jobs, and investment, and now rushing into over 60 newly… and this is incredible, brand, newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Iowa alone. Rich people are investing vast amounts of money. Tim Scott, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, came into my office. He said, “I have an idea that I have wanted to do for years, but we have never had a president that could pull it off.” I said, “What is it, Tim?” And he talked about Opportunity Zones, first time I heard it. And we did it, and there is nothing, nobody has ever seen anything like it. Money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there. What’s happening is incredible. Opportunity Zones. Remember it.

For decades, politicians ran for office, promising to protect American farmers and workers. You’ve heard it all your lives, right? But then, they went to Washington. They looked at those beautiful marble columns, and that gorgeous ceiling painted, and all that gold, the way they used to build the buildings, they don’t build them that way anymore. We could, but they just don’t know how. By the way, we’re building the wall. You know the wall is over a hundred miles long. It’s over a hundred miles long already and moving fast.

They went to Washington and they sold you out. That’s what happened. They sold your jobs out. They sold everything out. Globalist politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories, ravage our farms, rob our workers, and ransack our communities. But the era of economic surrender is over, because now we are finally putting America first, America first.
Before I took office, Washington looked the other way, while China stole our secrets from American agriculture. Your business, what they do scientifically, nobody understands what they have done to a seed. It doesn’t sound complicated. It is genius, what they have been able to do, what you have been able to do. But those secrets were being stolen, stolen. And installed massive barriers to your exports. You couldn’t do anything with exports, so people, not only China, many, many other places were stealing your secrets.
Our new agreement with China will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for American beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soybeans, rice, dairy, and much, much more.
But you know it is true. China is so big. 1.5 billion people. We have 350. 1.5 billion people, think of that, and we are just touching it. This deal will be so big. If it all works out, and you have the best product, the best product in the world, if it all works out, it will just keep expanding. 250 billion will end up being much, much more than that.

And, I’ve told this story before, when we were signing, we were almost finished and I said, “How much are the farmers getting?” Meaning how much are they going to purchase from the farmers. And Ambassador Lighthizer said, “We put 20 billion, sir. The highest ever was 16, so we made it 20.” I said “Make it 50.” They said, “What?” And then people, even farm people, said, “Sir, we can’t produce that much.” I said, “That’s a good problem, not a bad problem.” I said, “Make it 50,” so we now have, in the contract, from 40 to $50 billion worth of purchase.” Make it 50, make it 50! Right, Jared? I said, “Jared, you better make it 50.”
 I want those farmers to come back, say, “Sir, sir, we can’t do it. We can’t produce that much, sir, what are you doing to us?” I don’t think that would ever happen? Do you think that would ever, I said they will figure a way. He’s going “Absolutely not.” Nah, I said, “Don’t make it 20, make it 50.”
 The U.S.M.C.A. is another colossal victory for American agriculture like you have never had before. It’s time. We suffered for a year and a half, almost two years. Think of it, but not really because I was able to give you those, I won’t call them subsidies. I made that mistake once with the farmers. I said to this group of farmers that came in, “Subsidy.” I used the word subsidy. That was the worst word, “Sir, we don’t watch subsidy! Please don’t ever use that word.” I said, “I won’t, I promise.”
But we helped. And it will increase total agriculture exports by more than $2 billion annually. Think of that, including the huge dairy in Iowa, dairy, pork and poultry alone, so two billion just in those small [ 00:47:23]. Just in that small, little grouping where you were doing nothing. It’s called promises made, promises kept. Promises met.

The last time I came, I never did this before, I never ran, so they all said, “You never ran before. You can’t do this if you never ran,” so whatever happened, it happened. One by one, they started dropping out, right? And then I was left with one, Hillary Clinton, and that worked out very nicely. “He cannot get to 270,” remember? 270, electoral college. “He cannot get to 270.”
I went to Maine. It’s true, Maine, too. It’s got one point, right, one. I went there a lot, many times. Everyone said, well, they kept getting me, maybe if I have a great night, 269, but 269 loses. Right? But we got 306 to 223. 306, 223, so they were right, “You cannot get to 270, you can get to 306,” but not that there is…

In the eight years before my election, net farm income plummeted by 20%, you know that. If you look at a chart, for 15 years actually, not eight, for 15 years, it’s like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer. Soybeans. Take a look at it all. It was just a one way street. Everybody was ripping off the American farmer. Now you’re going to see numbers that are going to be great. Look at even what’s happened recently. It’s incredible what’s going on and I love it, because you deserve it. You suffered a lot, with people that were stupid. They were stupid! Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster. What are you going to do? You are going to vote for Bernie? You are going to vote for Bernie?

Here I am on the debate stage, “Well, net income has gone up for the farmers 50%.” Tell me, how the hell do I lose this debate? How do I lose? And based on the polls, I guess I’m not going to lose in this state. I don’t think I will lose in any other state either. Because this is really true all over the country. This is happening all over the country, not just Iowa.
On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than on immigration. Illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars, drains public services, overcrowds our schools and hospitals, and threatens innocent American lives at a number that you wouldn’t even believe. But we have got it closed up, but we’re getting your people in. You have people that have worked for you for a long time, don’t you? I know who the people that you have, and they are hard workers. We have a lot of great people. You have a lot of great people out there. Right here in Des Moines, a twice deported, illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman, her 11-year-old daughter, and her five-year-old son.

In this region of the county alone, last year, ICE officers arrested nearly 4,000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes, including robbery, rape, and murder.

Yet today’s Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration. We have no idea, now we do now, but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands. We have no idea who they are. Many are fine people and all of that, but some are stone cold rapists, and murderers, and people that their countries don’t want, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Mexico. Right now we have a love affair with Mexico because the Democrats, the Democrats wouldn’t give us what we needed and I got Mexico, they’re great. They put up 27,000 soldiers on our Southern border and the numbers are plummeting, 87% down.

The president of Mexico is doing a great job. And we ended Catch and Release. You think that was easy? Catch and Release, you know what Catch and Release is? You catch a criminal, you take the number, and you release him into the, they would never come back. We say, come back please in three years, this is a Democrat deal. Come back if you don’t mind, in three years. We release them into our country. We totally ended it through a very, very slick group of rules. Catch and Release. May we please have your address and your phone number? “Here it is!”

“What have you done?”

“I got out of jail.”

“Oh, well, welcome to the United States. Please, we have a little information. Okay, and now we’re going to release you, and in three and a half years, we schedule a court appearance for you.” Do you believe, this is the only country in the world. They catch somebody on the border. You’re supposed to be Perry Mason. You take them to court. Other countries catch somebody at the border. They say, ” Sorry, you got to get out.” We say, “Oh, may we have your information? We’re taking you to court.” Man.

Today’s Democrat Party glorifies illegal immigration, vilifies the heroes of law enforcement, and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely. They want open borders. They want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country. And some of those people, some of those people are stone cold killers. Some of those people, in the caravans, right? I came up with that name but they won’t give me credit for that. They don’t give me credit for anything. They don’t give me credit for fake news. Wasn’t that my term? Now they say, I see CNN, they said, “Fake news has reported,” no, no, you are fake news, that fake news is you. You are fake news.

They turned the term around. They are reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news. Left wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into American communities. We don’t want them. In New York City, the Mayor’s Sanctuary Policy recently forced the release of a-

… the mayor’s sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault. After being set free the same criminal raped, brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman. They wouldn’t give him to the ICE warriors. Their warriors. They’re tough and they love our country. They’re very tough and they love our country. They’re taking MS-13 gang members … They’re about as tough as you get, they’re taking them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands. That’s a tough job but they love to do it. They love our country.

Sanctuary city policies aren’t just wrong, they’re immoral, and they’re lethal, and they really are something that has to be stopped. They have to be stopped now. What’s happening is a disgrace.

Thankfully here in Iowa your great Republican governor, sometimes referred to as Governor Reynolds, signed a state-wide ban on sanctuary cities. Thank you Kim. That is why we need to elect more Republicans nationwide, to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states. Thank you Kim Reynolds. You know I endorsed her, so I want to take full credit for the job she has done. I endorsed her very early, right? Very early I endorsed her. I know talent. She’s done a great job.

Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. It’s true. We are finding the illegal game members, drug dealers, predators, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country, ideally. We don’t want to put them in prison because you know what? We got to pay for them for the next 50 years, but sometimes we have to. If they’re too dangerous we have no choice.

Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row, and they’re getting lower, and lower. Shockingly, as that wall gets longer, the crossings get less. Remember the Democrats? “You don’t need a wall. You don’t need a wall. You don’t need it.” Seven years they all voted for it, they just didn’t have the ability to build it. You know it’s not easy with land, and this, and that, and property, and rights. They couldn’t figure it out but I can figure it out. The problem was we couldn’t get the money, but we got all the money we need now. We have everything. We have everything. The last time, this last budget, they didn’t really fight us on the wall. You know why? Because they learned it’s a really bad issue for them. It’s a really bad issue. But I made one mistake with the wall. I should have said, “We will never ever build a wall.” They would have given me so much money to build a wall. That was my only … Because I used to go, “We will build the wall,” right? That was a mistake. I should have said, “We will never ever build it. Under no circumstances,” and they would have forced its building and I would have said, “Okay.”

By the way, in all due respect, you know who’s going to pay for the wall, right? No, no, they play … The fake news plays. No, no, through remittance illegal aliens from Mexico are going to pay for the call. That’s what it is. Remittance. 100% because when I say something I mean it. I said I was going to build a wall.

You think it’s easy when you have a party that controls the House, you got to end that. You got to end that. They said they picked up the House in ’18 but I didn’t run in ’18. You know the big difference when you run, ’16 I ran, ’18 I didn’t run. They did, they picked up some seats. I didn’t run, but I’m running this time and we’ve got to take back the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker of the House. Kevin McCarthy will be a great Speaker, watch.

But getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three, getting it built is … Honestly I don’t want to brag, nobody else could have done it. Nobody else could have done it. It’s The Real Deal wall. It’s the wall that border security wanted. Remember I thought I could just build concrete slabs? They didn’t want that because you have to be able to see through. I said, “Oh come on.” This is the expensive version. This is the best version. This is steel, and concrete, and rebar in between. It’s really something.
Did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top? They couldn’t get over. We had to get the fire department to get them down. They couldn’t get over and they’re like mountain climbers. They got used to climbing. They got caught because you know that panel? That’s an anti-climb panel. It’s very hot and very tough. It’s a very hard panel to climb, the panel on top. Sometimes I’d say, “I’d rather do without that panel,” because I’m a very visual person. They said, “Sir that’s anti-climb panel.” I said, “Oh it is? Okay, let’s put it on. To hell with it.” It’s true. Anti-climb panel.
The wall is the top of the line. That’s what they wanted. Mostly 30 feet tall. That’s very tall. That’s maximum. It’s really doing a big trick. A lot … Wherever we have it … 100 miles is all of a sudden a lot, but where you have that it’s incredible. 99.9%, especially when we’re watching it. We’re watching the sections.

Illegal crossings now are down 75% since last spring. The powerful border wall was starting to set. I mean pretty soon we’ll be setting records in speed. It’s going up very rapidly. Very rapidly. You’re seeing it all over and it’s going to be really something. Look, it would be nice if we didn’t have to have it. It would be great, but we have to have it. They said, “Oh we could have drones.” Oh what are you going to do with drones flying around? When people are going through your border with nowhere … They’re going to have drones flying around. They know because they were all for it. They were all for it. Now all of a sudden they’re against, but they want drones. Well we’re going to have drones too but the drones are policing the wall.

In terms of human trafficking, people don’t even talk about it. Because of the internet, sadly, the worst in the history of our world. All over the world. Trafficking in women and children all over the world. All over the world. The worst it’s ever been, but when we have this border it makes it very, very tough for them to come into the United States with women and with children stuffed in trunks in the back of a car.

The Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders’ government healthcare takeover bill. It’s a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180,000 million great Americans of your private coverage. You want that. You got great deals. You’re able to negotiate, you’re able to keep your doctor, keep your area, keep your hospitals, keep everything that you wanted. Now they want to take it away. Report to an operating room when you have a cold, okay? In your local hospital. I don’t think so. 180,000 million people, but I’m not going to knock it because I want Bernie to bring it right up to the end and we’ll debate it the day before the election. Okay? We are saving your healthcare while Socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare.
Sleepy Joe has no idea what he’s even … He doesn’t even know what he’s talking about. He’s so lost. Honestly, that poor guys is so lost. They talk healthcare, she said, “It’s over for him.” It was over for him, actually if you knew him, a long time ago. Now it’s really over.

We are making healthcare better and cheaper. We got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed Obamacare. We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party. We’re stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent. I signed it already. Everything now is going to transparencies, where hospitals, doctors, everybody has to tell you how much things are costing. Watch those prices come down. Right? Right?

I have an expert on healthcare. He said transparency because it’s a big deal. It’s a big deal. Nobody else would have gotten it done, that I can tell you. Transparency is bigger than healthcare because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn’t believe. People go in for a blood test, they get charged $2,700. Down the road they get the same test for $57. The same exact test. Maybe it’s better. Maybe it’s better. It’s crazy. When you have transparency it’s all going to come. You watch. You watch. But this person, a real expert, said, “This is bigger than healthcare,” and I got it done. Unfortunately it won’t really start kicking in until after the election because it takes a period of time. They have certain statutory requirements, et cetera.

Well you better let me win. Can you imagine? Can you imagine? I did transparency, I took the guts, I did transparency and then I’m going to watch as somebody else says, “Didn’t he do a great job for transparency?” You better let me win because I want the credit for that one.

We’re buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever, ever, ever before. We are defending your right to keep the doctor. We are defending your right to keep your plan. Remember Obama 28 times, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your doctor”? 28. “You can also keep your plan. You can keep it. You can keep it.” 28 times he lied. We should impeach him. No, he got it on a lie. He got it on a lie, but we’ve run it much better. But essentially it’s totally different because of individual mandate. Because that really took the guts out of it and we’re running it much better.
I had a choice, do we run it well or do we run it poorly? If we run it poorly everyone’s going to blame me. If we run it well everyone’s going to give him credit, especially the fakers back there right? But you know what? We got to run it well but we’re coming up with a healthcare that if we win the House we will have the best healthcare of any country in the world, by far.
 We’re fighting the lobbyists and we’re fighting the special interest, in case you didn’t notice. We are serving only you. Thanks to our bold reforms we’re now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than Obamacare. We’re offering a lot of different things. We have just passed, recently, 10 months ago, Right to Try. I love Right to Try.

You know what that is? That’s people are terminally ill and they can’t use medicine because … They’ve been trying to pass this, almost for 50 years. You can’t use the medicine. We have the greatest doctors, labs, hospitals in the world. They come up with a medicine but it has to go through the FDA procedure, right? You can’t do anything. You can’t use it. They won’t let you use it. Now I have you sign an agreement, you’re not going to sue the United States, you’re not going to this, your family, et cetera, et cetera. Very simple. And they can use it. You have no idea the results that are taking place. You have no idea. You have no idea the results. People’s lives are being …
For me it was simple. I said, “Wait a minute, you’re worried about hurting somebody? These people are dying. They’re terminally ill. They’re admitting they’re terminally ill and you won’t let them use a drug that may work? Let the use the drug.” And we’re letting them use the drug and it’s working in a lot of cases.

We have transformed veterans healthcare, including VA Choice. The best. You know I think I’m a totally brilliant human being. I think I’m the smartest person, so I came up with a plan. I’ll never forget, I was in New Hampshire, I came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying, “Sir it’s really terrible what’s happening with healthcare. We’re waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks.” Honestly people were waiting in line, they weren’t very sick, they were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor. By the time they got to the doctor. So I came up with this incredible plan. Only I could think of this. I said, “Here’s what you do … Here’s what you do, if somebody can’t get a doctor quickly,” because we have great doctors at the VA. They don’t get enough credit. “If you can’t get to a doctor quickly you go outside, you go locally, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself all better.” Right?
 So I went back. I went back and I told my people, “Do you have any idea how smart I am? Listen to this plan I have.” They said, “Actually sir we’ve known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn’t get it approved.” So I said, “Oh that’s too bad, I thought it was brilliant,” but what I am good at is getting things approved and I got it approved. People are using it and it’s great.

I know the people of Iowa don’t care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural healthcare. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. That’s a great thing. Our great first lady is helping us with that. That is such a big thing for Melania. Big, big thing. She is really involved.
 We will never let the Democrats give away your healthcare to illegal immigrants, especially when we say, “Come in. Come in, we’ll give you healthcare.” It’s one thing they come in and it’s a rough situation because we all have hearts but when people are saying, like in California this wacky governor he says, “Come in, we’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you free education. We’re going to give you everything. We’re going to give you a beautiful Rolls-Royce.” See to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters said, “Donald Trump said that the governor of California promised a Rolls-Royce to illegal immigrants. He didn’t promise them. This was a lie and a misrepresentation by President Trump.” They can’t take a little humor. They can’t take it. These people are sick. They’re sick. No. They’re sick people.

Them and Shifty Schiff is a very sick person. He lies awake at night shifting and turning, Shifty. Shifting and turning in his bed, sweating like a dog. “How am I going to get him? He didn’t do anything wrong, how am I going to get him?” Oh what a sick guy he is.
Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion. Ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb. Right up until the moment of birth. That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, Socialism, and blatant corruption. No matter how you cut it, that’s what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. You know that, right? Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe.

Remember I always said, “I can be more presidential than any other past president, other than perhaps Abraham Lincoln when he’s wearing the hat,” right? Because it’s easy to be presidential but only have about three people in front of me. Be a, “Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Is everything okay in Iowa? Oh I see, the world is ripping you off. Well there’s not a thing I can do about that. Thank you. Good night everybody. Good night.” No, we got to do it the right way. Republicans …
 And by the way, can I be honest? Doing this takes far more talent than doing that. Doing that is very easy. This is not easy. Especially when you just left Michigan, and you just left other places, and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years. You got the maniacs for three years. I think before I came down the escalator with our future first lady I think really they were doing it then. They started even before I came down on the escalator. These people are maniacs, so you have all that. So you’re fighting that and you’re doing farm bills.
 We got your farm bill approved by the way. We got your farm bill approved. I don’t even mention that because that’s massive by any other standard, but it’s peanuts compared to the USMCA and the China deal, right? So I don’t even mention it.

Anyway, Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. It’s true. Our numbers with African American workers, people, are through the roof. Are through the roof because … Remember I used to say, “What do you have to lose?” I’d read the down the worst on crime, the worst on education. They got this, they got that, they got 10 different things, all horrible. One day I’m in front of this tremendous group of people and I’m reading this list, African American, they have the highest crime rate, they have the highest this, they have the worst education, they have the worst schools, they have the worst … I said, “Stay with me,” because they were with the Democrats for a hundred years, more. I said, “Stay with me. What the hell do you have to lose?”
 You know what? You know what? Remember that? Now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers, they have the best poverty numbers, they have numbers that nobody would believe. They’re doing so great. It’s so great to see it. It’s incredible. Youth unemployment, African American youth. It’s been great.

We’re asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are a big tent and a big party with big, bold, beautiful ideas for the future. We’re what the country was based on originally. It was called greatness. It was called greatness.
During National School Choice Week, School Choice everybody, we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools. Iowa became one of the first states to pass School Choice. That was over 10 years ago. Now Governor Reynolds, Senator Ernst, Senator Grassley, and more than 100 members of Congress are supporting our plan to give School Choice to every child in America who needs it. It’s a great plan.

To give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform. Think of that. Think of that. We had a lot of great Conservatives who wanted it, we had Liberals who wanted it. They couldn’t get it passed. President Obama couldn’t even come close. He didn’t try too hard. He talked like, “Oh I’ll try.”
To uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record, who will interpret The Constitution as one. And two great Supreme Court justices, by the way. As part as … Right? Two great ones.

As part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an $8.5 million facility to support our Iowa Guardsmen at Camp Dodge, right here in Des Moines, Iowa. Right here, Camp Dodge. Camp Dodge everybody. We take care of Camp Dodge.
 I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace. We’re going to see if we can get that done. It’s one of the toughest deals of all. One of the toughest deals but we have a shot at it.

For years you watched as your politicians apologized for our country. They apologized. They would say, “I’m sorry.” Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Iowa. We are standing up for Iowa.
At stake in our present battle is the survival, frankly, of our nation. Look, I can make this speech really short. All I have to do is say, “Hello Iowa, you have no choice. You have to vote for me. Otherwise everything that you’ve built in your entire life will be gone. Goodbye Iowa, have a good time.” Instead I work my ass off up here, okay? Yeah. True. Do you think this is easy? It’s a little hot in this room. This room wasn’t designed for this many people.

If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. We have to.
 By the way, for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children … Because of our great tax bill, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, the biggest that you benefit by. Because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax, as they call it. So I always say, “If you love your children that’s a great thing. If you don’t love your children don’t leave it to them and that particular tax won’t matter,” but if you love … Is there anybody here that does not love your children? Is there anybody here who loves your children? Well it’s Iowa. It’s Iowa. You love your children. You know you have no tax to pay, you leave your …

In the old days, meaning before Trump, what would happen? You’d leave your farm, they’d assess your farm for a massive amount that kids would go out to a bank, they’d borrow money up to their eyeballs and they’d end up losing the farm. Now you can leave your farm … And they did that to pay the tax. Now you can leave your farm, you don’t pay inheritance tax or [ 01:19:03]. No, it’s great. So when you’re looking down at your children you’re saying, “Oh did you get lucky? Did you get lucky? Look at them, they’re enjoying life.”
But only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. That swamp is bad. That swamp is bad. I had no idea it was going to be this sick and this degenerated. It’s a degenerate swamp. I had no idea. When I came out, I said, “We’re going to drain this swamp.” I had no idea that the swamp was that evil, but we’re winning. We’re winning because we’re in The White House. We’re winning.

With your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependents to independents, and poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening all over our country. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. It’s already happening. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products made, raised, farmed, and grown right here in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine. Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. We’ve already started.
 Should have been started in the last administration. Incredible. Should have been started earlier, but we started. In less than 10 years, the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated, will be gone. Who would have thought that was possible? When they came in and told me that a couple of years ago, I said, “Really? Nobody knows that.” Incredible the strides that we’ve made.

We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. In the state of Virginia they want to take your guns away, you believe it? Virginia, I love Virginia. Of all states, they want to take your guns away. The Democrats. Not going to happen.
 Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We are one great America. We support, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that family and faith, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way, not government bureaucracy. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. We live by those words, in God we trust.

From Cambridge, good old Cambridge. Who’s from Cambridge here please? Cambridge. What the hell do I mention it for when there’s two people here? Can I say it anyway? I’ll say it anyway. Good place Cambridge. Good, he said it’s amazing. Well, from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids where I made my last speech prior to the election. What a place, 32,000 people. I said, “I’m going to win tomorrow.” To Rock Rapids, from Melbourne to Moorhead, and from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, Iowa. We stand on the shoulders of true red blooded American heroes.
 This great state was founded by tough, tough, tough frontier men. These are tough people. Let’s see how big and how tough. They’re tough. Anybody like to join ICE? You want to join ICE? He says, “No thank you.” And strong pioneer women who defied the dangers to carve out a life and a beautiful home with great families and great neighbors. They tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, tilled the soil, planted the fields and help make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are making it greater and greater every single day.

Proud citizens like you helped to build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, where it has always belonged. It’s coming back to you, you see that. With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working and we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen, and especially the great ladies and gentlemen of Iowa, the best is yet to come. True, true. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you.",30/1/20
"Hello, Manchester, and I am thrilled to be in the great state of New Hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And I’ll tell you what — we have more in this arena, and I hate to say this to you… we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in. So if you’d like to give up your seat or where you’re standing… Sorry we couldn’t get you seats, but if you want to give it up, let them come in, you go out. Does anybody want to make that deal? I don’t think so.

But we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates, meaning the Democrats, put together and multiplied times fave. And the fake news, these guys will never report that. They’ll never report it. They don’t even like showing the crowd. They always show my face. They never show the crowd. But you know what? The people can hear the crowd. The people can hear the crowd. They know. That is not the sound of 200 people. One of their prime candidates today, they worked a big deal. They had exactly 104 people, and the fake news said, “It was a nice crowd. Very nice.” If I had one empty seat here, one empty seat in this massive arena, they’d say, “He didn’t sell out.” But you know what? We have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator. Never, not one time. And we have the biggest arenas in the country.
 With your help on November 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats. We are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy we’ve ever had, the most prosperity. We have got the most prosperity we’ve ever had. By the way, we’re going to keep it that way, too, if it’s okay.

And we’ve just built the most powerful military anywhere in the world. It was totally depleted. Now it has all brand new jets. It’s got brand new missiles and rockets and everything you can imagine. And if it hasn’t been shipped yet, it’s going to be shipped soon. On Tuesday, I delivered my address on the State of the Union, and I had somebody behind me who was mumbling terribly, mumbling, mumbling, [ 00:06:19], who was mumbling, very distracting, very distracting. It’s true. You know, it was very distracting. I’m speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me, angry. There was a little anger back there. We’re the ones that should be angry, not them. We’re the ones that should be angry, but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before.
And the day after my address, our good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete, and absolute, total acquittal. And it ,wasn’t even close and I want to thank our Republican senators and our Republican House members. They were tremendous. In the House, we won 196 to nothing and then we got three Democrats. And in the Senate, other than Romney, we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing. That’s something, and in one case we got 53 to nothing, but I don’t even count that to be honest.

The radical left’s pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes… think of that… 18 votes to spare, with a lot of votes to spare. And also very importantly, as of today, I… we, because it’s not we. It’s not I. It’s we. We’re all in this together. We have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had. Thank you, Nancy, very much. Thank you.
 While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with this vile hoax, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our borders, and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. From our rural communities to our cities, we are expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Amazing.

And I listened. I watched. I had all these experts. They were saying, “Yes, I think 60,000.” Another one said 101,000. Another one said 125. Another one was 118. And then the number came out, 225,000. Pretty good. Pretty good. We have destroyed the ISIS caliphate. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al-Baghdadi is dead. Al-Baghdadi is dead, and we just took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever.
 The fact is, America is respected again. It’s been a long time. But as we keep on winning, Washington democrats keep on losing their minds. They’re crazy. That’s why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They’re joining our great Republican party. Now, I can’t tell you what’s happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here, right? Remember last time? We won the primary tremendously. We should have won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses. And it was very, very close even though they did, but this year we have a great governor, Governor Sununu. Great governor, Chris. And now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it should be a lot different. But we have done great. This has been an incredible state for us. It’s a state where the people are great, just great people. And we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries, don’t you? So I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats. Does that make sense? You people wouldn’t do that. My only problem is I’m trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate? I think they’re all weak if you want to know the truth.

We proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission. A very simple mission, remember? Make America great again. And then after we make it great again, which we already have… We’ve had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high. 141, think about it. Out of three years, 141. And to me, I view it differently. Well, look at your 401ks. I mean, who is doing well with their 401k? Up 90%. Up 104%. Is there anybody doing badly with the 401k? I’d like to not talk to that person. Does anybody have a 401k where they’re doing badly, please? Oh, don’t put up your hand. I don’t believe it.
 Nah, the 401ks, they’re up 90%, 95%. I always tell this story. People come up to me. They say, “I want to thank you. My wife thinks I’m a total loser, sir. She thinks I am the worst person with money, with financial. She thinks I’m just horrible. In the last three years, I’m up 94%, sir. She thinks I’m a total genius when it comes to finance. She loves me again. She didn’t love me before, sir. She loves me again.” That tells you something about money, doesn’t it?

The first step to victory in November is tomorrow. Go send a message that Republicans… And you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want. Don’t worry about it. I don’t really think we actually have a candidate against us… that Republicans are energized, that we’re united, and that nine months from now we are going to take back the House of Representatives. We are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House.
You know, they always talk about the Democrats. They have enthusiasm, right? We have so much more enthusiasm than them. It’s not even close. They’re all fighting each other. They’re all going after each other. You got them all over the place. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. They don’t know what they’re doing. They can’t even count their votes.

We’re thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country, great national leaders. I want to thank our tremendous Vice President, Mike Pence, who spoke earlier this evening. And also with us, our warrior senators, the two people that wanted to be here. They’re going to be here tomorrow. They’re going to be here to get out the vote. I don’t think we have to worry too much about it, but that’s okay… And very highly respected, Senators Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul. Great guys. Warriors, they’re warriors. Hey, Lindsay and Rand. That’s not bad. Can you imagine if you actually came from New Hampshire what it would be? Right? That’s not bad, but they have been great. All they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said, “Read the transcripts please. Read the transcripts.” But I want to thank you both very much. Two great people, two great friends. Man, look at all that television back there. Whoa! That’s bigger than those terrible Academy Awards, I’ve got to tell you. That used to be big. Not so much anymore.
 A friend of mine, another great leader and somebody that’s going to be Speaker of the House hopefully next year, Kevin McCarthy. Our leader, Kevin McCarthy. Oh, will that be nice to have Kevin, a pro. You’ll see things get done like you’ll never believe. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Great.

A very brave man… He took a bullet. He got shot and he got up. He was going to die that night. I tell this story all the time. His wife, she was crying so much. When he finally did awake, I said, “Well, one thing I learned, your wife loves you.” “Why do you say that?” “Because she was devastated.” I know many wives that don’t get too upset. His wife was devastated. His family was devastated. The doctor told me he didn’t have a good chance, but he’s tough as hell and he’s a really terrific friend. He’s a winner. He put himself back into shape. He actually looks better now than he did before he got shot. Steve Scalise. Lot of guts.
 Your NRCC Chairman, Mr, Tom Emmer. Congressman, thank you. Tom Emmer. Thank you, Tom. And Representatives Mark Meadows. Did anybody ever hear of Mark Meadows? These are warriors. Matt Gates. Matt. Whoa! Not bad, Matt. That’s not bad. Mike Johnson, great lawyer. Mike Johnson. Thank you, Mike. And a man with a very familiar last name, Greg Pence, the brother of Mike. Thank you. Thank you, Greg. And thanks also to New Hampshire Senate Republican leader, Chuck Morse. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you.

And I see somebody, two great people, a great couple in the audience, Matt Schlapp and Mercedes Schlapp. They are warriors also. They’re warriors also. And I see next to them, two warriors. Corey, you just are such a fighter. You are such a fighter. Ah, boy, if we could get him to run for Senate, he would win so easily. Corey Lewandowski, who loves this state a lot. And Dave Bossie. Thank you, David. Thank you, David. Great job.
 I’m just picking these people out of the audience. We have everybody here. The New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Thank you, Dick. Thank you, Dick. A man who’s been with us right from the beginning… When I left here last time, I felt so good. Everybody coming up to the room, “you’re going to win. You’re going to…” We win by a lot, right? We had actually a total of 18, and we won. We had a tremendous night and I’ve never forgotten it. And there was a friend of ours, Chairman of the New Hampshire Republican party, Steve Stepanek. Steve Stepanek. That was a big evening.

And three friends of mine that are co-chairmen, Al Baldasaro, Fred Doucette…

Baldasaro, Fred Ducette, and Lou Gargiulo. Thank you all very much. And David and Corey, thank you also for being here. Also a woman that not too many people know. Very powerful, very smart, very beautiful even though I’m not allowed to say that because she’s my daughter, Ivanka.
Fred Ducette and Lou Gargiulo. Thank you all very much. And David and Corey, thank you also for being here. Also a woman that not too many people know. Very powerful, very smart, very beautiful, even though I’m not allowed to say that because she’s my daughter, Ivanka. Come here. Come on up, Ivanka.

And Jared who’s making deals that are so good for this country, people have no idea what’s happening. I will tell you, we are making trade deals and other deals the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. Jared Kushner. Thank you, Jared. Thank you. And Kimberly, thank you so much. I heard your speech on the plane on the way in. I was very impressed. And did Don Jr. make a good speech? Come on.

They’re good kids. They went through a lot with this hoax, I want to tell you. They went through a lot with the hoax.

Helping us was the RNC chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel. Great job. I said, “Get me the woman from Michigan to head up the RNC! Who’s that woman from Michigan to head up the RNC?” Thank you, Ronna. Great job. Setting all kinds of records, polling records, contribution records, everything. We’re doing everything so it’s great.
 And Tommy Hicks. I want you to say hello, Tommy Hicks, who’s a special friend. And Haley. Thank you, darling. I retweeted you, Haley. I retweeted you all over the place.

And all together we’re building the world’s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world. It’s a great thing. It’s a great thing. Since my election, America’s gained 7 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. You believe that one? That’s pretty amazing. That’s pretty amazing. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, all time, never been lower than what it is now.

And by the way, our poll numbers with African Americans, with Hispanic Americans, with Asian Americans, the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships. They’re going up. African American youth unemployment is so important. It was a horrible number a few years ago. You remember, it was a really terrible thing was happening. It’s just reached the lowest time in the history, lowest, the best number in the history of our country.

And African American poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded. Wages for African American workers have increased by $2,400 per year, also a record. And you know this. For decades, the Democrat party has betrayed African Americans. They betrayed us all. They betrayed all of us. But we’re delivering for African Americans. We’re delivering for Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans like nobody has ever done. We are fighting for great jobs, great schools, great healthcare, and a truly great future for our country and for them. We are the party of equal opportunity for all Americans.

Thank you. To support working families, we’ve reduced the cost of childcare, expanded paid leave, and given 40 million American families an average of $2,200 more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Who would have thought that?

We have cut more job killing regulations than any… You know this one. So you go back four years, eight years. In one case, longer than eight years. We’ve cut more job killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country, and we’re not finished.

We’ve ended the war on American energy. They want to take our energy away. They want to take our wealth away. They want to give us wind. Wind. If it blows, wonderful. If it doesn’t blow, you got problems. Wind. They want to destroy our countrysides, put windmills all over them. Watch your house go down in value. You ever see what happens? They build a windmill within distance of your house. You could forget about your house. You could just say, well, that was the end of that investment. You want to see a bird graveyard, go to the bottom of a windmill. Take a look. It’s a graveyard for birds. They kill all the birds. Lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump, that’s what we’re doing.

We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, Washington politicians… You know this. They shuttered New Hampshire factories. You were one of the worst examples ever. NAFTA, what NAFTA to your communities, I mean to your state, is incredible. Shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism. We can forget globalism. We want to take care of our country.
 New Hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO, the World Trade Organization, one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country. For decades, politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace NAFTA. They lied. They never did it. They never even tried to do it. They wouldn’t have been able to anyway. It wasn’t easy, I will tell you that. But then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing.

But I’m not like those other politicians. I keep my promises. We took care of it. We took care of it. You saw last month being bye-bye. I say Donald J. Trump, bye-bye NAFTA. We ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US Mexico Canada Agreement into law. That’s going to be great for our manufacturers, our farmers. Great for everybody. Great for our workers. The USMCA will bring jobs back to New Hampshire right where they belong. They should have never left in the first place.

Probably the number one reason I ran for office. I’m one for one. I have friends. Some of these great senators, look at Lindsey over there and look at Rand. These great senators. Sure, I’ve run five times and I’ve won three. And other senators said “Sir, I’ve won seven times, sir.” Southern senator. “I won seven times, sir, and I’ve won five of those damn contests.” I said, “Senator, I ran once and I won just once.” And we’re going to run twice and that’s going to be it. Although they think we’re going to run much more than that, you know that, right? It scares the hell out of the fake news, I will tell you. They can’t take a joke.
 I also took the strongest ever action to confront China’s massive theft of American jobs, and our strategy worked. Massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions. We never took in 25 cents from China. They ripped us so much you wouldn’t believe it. Now they respect us again. Last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents. The money that’s pouring in, people don’t even believe it.

And by the way, the virus, they’re working hard. Looks like by April, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that’s true, but we’re doing great in our country. China, I spoke with president Xi and they’re working very, very hard and I think it’s going to all work out fine. Rough stuff, I tell you. Rough, rough stuff, but I think it’s going to work out good. We only have 11 cases and they’re all getting better. But our trade agreement with China will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and substantially boost exports of American made goods. Is that nice?

After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than a thing called immigration, right? Before I came into office, the far left’s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that’s what they want. I see them campaigning right down the street. It’s really boring to watch, but I try and watch. No, I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff. But they want open borders. They want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom are not exactly what we’re looking for, okay? I mean murderers, rapists, and some other things. They’re going to be poisoning our children with drugs, including right here in New Hampshire, and you have one of the drug problems in the country. And we brought it down 18% but we have to do better. 18%. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone into our country from all around the world. Just come on in, folks, we’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to give you free education. We’re going to give you more than our vets are getting. Every family will get a free Rolls Royce. You know I said that, Matt. I said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said, “President Trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free Rolls Royce. He lied. He lied. He lied.” They gave me a Pinocchio. They don’t get it, Matt, do they, Matt? Actually they get it better than we understand. They get it very well. They get it. They know what’s happening. And the wall is being built. I will tell you the wall is being built. And you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up. So what’s happening? You do know who’s paying for the wall, don’t you? Right. Redemption from illegal aliens that are coming. The redemption money is paying for the wall. They’re so sad to hear that because it’s okay, finally, they go. You have to understand an entire party is fighting. They’ll give me anything I want. Our military would rebuilt it. 2.2, it’s really $2.5 trillion over a period of three years. They give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall. They said, “We like drones.” Well, drones don’t keep people out. Drones are wonderful. They fly around, take pictures. We’re going to give you a drone. No good. So we now have built over 100 miles of wall.

And when we have that wall built, you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don’t come in. I say they can’t come in. They don’t come in. So we up to over a hundred, substantially more than a hundred miles of wall, and we’ll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future. And by the way, you have to see. You wouldn’t believe it. You have to see what happens when that wall goes up. You have to see the numbers change like magic. They change like magic. You ever hear the thing with all the modern technology, all of the new computers, the new genius, the new everything, cyber this, cyber that, two things never change, right? A wheel and a wall.

Right? A wheel and a wall. They’re going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years. They’re never going to replace the wheel and they’re never going to replace the wall, and it’s a high wall. Illegal immigrants coming in, coming into our country illegally, very few of them are getting in right now. Mexico has been terrific. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87% from this year and this time last year.

And for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild the cities in America. We could rebuild our cities. But I have something, because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies, read the snake. The snake. Does anybody know what I’m talking about? She knows. She’s been standing outside for four days, no wonder. And you look good, I’ll tell you what. Four days outside in the rain and snow. Look at these front row people. These are warriors. They’re warriors too, like my congressmen and senators.

So this is because we mentioned. I made minor changes. They mentioned illegal immigration. This is about immigration. This was a song from the 1950s, Al Green. And they mentioned little changes to it, that’s okay. But they mentioned illegal immigration, right? And I used to do this a lot and people couldn’t get enough of it, to be honest with you. And I haven’t done it for a while, and I thought I’d do it tonight because you’re on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders. They want open borders, and we don’t want open borders. We want very strong closed borders. And we want people to come into our country, but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally, right? Right? Through merit and legally. Right?

So we’ll do this quickly. This is illegal immigration. It’s called… Oh, listen to how quiet it is. Listen to how quiet. Now watch how quiet it gets. Gets so quiet. But this is all about… I love you too. That was a guy that said that, but I love him too. I love everybody. Ready? So important. Illegal immigration.

On our way to work one morning down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried, “I’ll take you in and I’ll take care of you.” Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake.

She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been fully, fully revived. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed that vicious snake.

She clutched him to her bosom. “You’re so beautiful,” she cried. “But if I hadn’t brought you in by now, you truly would have died.” She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake.

“I saved you,” cried the woman, “and you’ve bitten me, but why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I’m going to die.” “Shut up, silly woman,” said the reptile with a grin. “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” Got to come in legally and through merit. Under my administration we’re fully taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of African American and Hispanic Americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE officers… We love our ICE officers. The Democrats don’t like them. The Democrats don’t like them. ICE officers are the toughest human beings, and they love the country as much as anybody in this room. Last year alone they

… in this room. Last year alone, they arrested over 2,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Over 2,000 accused of murder, yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the American community. One of guests at the State of the Union was American citizen, Jody Jones. I introduced him that night. His beloved brother, Rocky, was murdered by a criminal alien in California, shot him eight times at close range, wouldn’t stop. Rocky’s killer had been previously arrested many, many times, but under California’s totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law, authorities were ordered to set him free.
Tragically, left wing politicians in New Hampshire tried to replicate California’s disastrous policies. Last year, the Democrat controlled New Hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state. And by the way, you have a great governor, Chris Sununu. He’s on top of it. He’s on top of it. And his father is a great guy. His father didn’t like me too much a few years ago. Once I won, I’m telling you, he was so good. He was as good. He fought like hell for us, all of us. It’s a great family, and Chris is doing a fantastic job.

If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020, November. And thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and we’ve ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch an illegal alien by law. You then take his name and address. They don’t have addresses. What’s your address? What? They don’t have addresses. They come into the country, they don’t have addresses. So you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say, “We’ll see you in four years for your court case.” We never see them. They never come back. We have seized record amounts of drugs. We have deported record numbers of gang members, MS-13 by the thousands. And we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history.

Remember this. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. Taking their cues from crazy Bernie, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie’s healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their very, very coveted private coverage. The Democrat party wants to run your healthcare, but they can’t even run a caucus in Iowa. By the way, it’s a week, a week. You know I turned on at seven o’clock. I wanted to see who won. They said, “There’s a little problem.” Little did they know? Does anybody [ 00:45:53] … Does anybody know who won Iowa? I don’t know. Maybe Rander, Lindsey. Grant, does anybody know who won? Lindsey, you’re a total pro. Nobody knows. He said nobody. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. They’re going to run your health care. Unbelievable. Nobody knows who won. Actually, I think they’re trying to take it away from Bernie again. I think Bernie came in second. Can you believe it? They’re doing it to you again, Bernie. They’re doing it to you again.

We’re saving your healthcare while these socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare. We are making healthcare better and much, much cheaper. You’ve seen what we did. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will. The Republican party always will. Always will. And we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world, the individual mandate. We had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune. You paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare. And we got rid of it, saved a lot of money for a lot of people. And we’re stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent. That’s bigger than healthcare transparency and that’ll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time. It would be nice if we could get it earlier, but it’s all done. It’s all signed.

Because when providers are required to show you what the prices are, those prices are going to come tumbling down. Blood tests as an example, one hospital has them for $53. Another hospital, the same test, $2,415. Same exact test. And it may even be better, who knows? We’re approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country. That’s bringing prices down. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan. Remember President Obama, you could keep your plan. You could keep 28 times. You can keep your doctor. That didn’t turn out very good. We should impeach him for that. Why aren’t we impeaching him? 28 times, you can keep your doctor. We should impeach President Obama.

Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Abraham Lincoln. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We love people. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. People are signing up left and right. But if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow, go ahead. Pick one. Pick the weakest one you think, I don’t know who it is. We are a big party with big ideas for the future. Very big. We become a big party and an open-minded party and we’re the party that people like. We’re the hot party and we’re the party with all the enthusiasm. We are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right?

We pass criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Most incredible thing that’s happened. Prisoners never really had a shot. They’d get out, they couldn’t get a job no matter what they did, and they’d go back. They’d go back to their ways. I mean, in many cases I guess they had no choice. It was a disaster. Now they’re getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we’ve done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities, zones, et cetera, they’re getting jobs and employers are loving them. They’re doing great. They’re doing great. They are doing great first time ever. They’re not going back.

To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And as you know, we’ve also confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices. Thank you very much. Thank you, Grant. Thank you, Lindsey. Thank you. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, as I said, and I love saying it because we are funding for New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Army National Guard readiness centers just a few miles from here in Pembroke and in Concord. Concord, I love Concord. I love Concord. Oh, Concord. You know how famous Concord is? Concord. That’s the same Concord that we read about all the time, right? Concord. I love Concord.

I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, been trying to do that for 52 years. We got it done. And for years you watched as your politicians … They really, I mean, they went out, “I’d like to apologize for the behavior of the United States.” No, no. We don’t know we don’t apologize anymore. We don’t apologize. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of New Hampshire. Thank you. At stake in our present battle is to survival actually of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory November 3rd, 2020. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I will tell you, that swamp is much worse than I thought when I was out here innocently campaigning. Let’s drain the swamp. That swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought. That swamp is that dirty swamp.
That’s a dirty swamp. You have some really evil, dirty, horrible people. Like to say nice, everyone’s nice. They’re not good. They’re not good people. But we’re draining that sucker slowly but surely.

With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. How about that? It’ll be done. We will land the first woman in the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. We’re very advanced. All made in the USA. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to-
… keep and bear arms. We’re going to protect your Second Amendments. By the way, they’re going to take away everything. They’re going to take away your wealth. They’re going to take away your guns. They’re going to take away everything. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, “In God we trust.”

From Nashua to Dixville, from Portsmouth to Plymouth, from Concord to Claremont, and from Meredith to right here in Manchester, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. New Hampshire was founded by tough frontier men and strong, powerful pioneer women who defied the dangers and raised their children to embrace the eternal motto, “Live free or die.” I love that motto. Live free or die. These courageous Americans tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, changed the hills, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth and we are making it greater. Every single day, greater than ever before.

Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what this is all about. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, the best is yet to come.
Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you.",10/2/20
" Thank you very much, Phoenix. We love to be back. We’ll be back a lot. We’re going to win that election. Thank you very much. Hello, Phoenix.

It’s great being here in the great state of Arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And with your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide.

It’s all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War II veteran into the arena. I don’t know if he knows it, but he’s right now the hottest celebrity in the world. I don’t know what’s going on here. He might even be hotter than Trump right now, I have to say. Did you see the scene? No, he’s all over television. Even fake news CNN him on. They say he’s a legitimate great hero of World War II. Erwin Julian. Irvin, thank you.

And I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things, and give them to Erwin right now. And I want to thank you. Really, that’s a great honor. And thank you for the great job you’ve done. An American Patriot. Thank you very much. Thank you, Don. How did Don do tonight? Okay? He’s good. Good guy. And he loves this country.
 So this is truly an incredible time for America. We have the best economy, the most prosperous country that we’ve ever had, and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far. Do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union? You remember that, right? And that was my honor. But I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before.

And after three years, of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades… It was the radical left’s pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow our entire system of government. But guess what? They failed, and our poll numbers are higher today than they’ve ever been before. And we’re standing up to the defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself. We’re doing something that’s never been done in the history of our country. This movement has never taken place. Nothing like it ever. And the fake news can attest to it, because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing, it’d be out there immediately. It’d be all over the place. It’d be all over the place. Trump exaggerates. That’s terrible what he says. There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early. It began in 2016 with that wonderful, beautiful night. You remember that, right? That beautiful night in November. And we’re going to have another beautiful night in November. This time, it’s going to be November 3rd. Get ready, November 3rd. We’re coming. We’re coming.

So we’re having great polls. You’re seeing the polls, except for some of the fake ones. And if I was treated fairly… Meaning, if you were treated fairly by the fake news, we’d be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn’t even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, it’s probably going to be competitive. But I actually think we’re going to win by a lot, just like we did last time. But I really believe we’d be up 20 points. I mean, all they do is negative, negative, phony stuff. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax. That’s a hoax.
 But you know, we had great support from the Republican party in the House. It was 197 to nothing. And in the Senate, it was 52 and-a-half to a half. You know what the half was? A halfwit. And while the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with the hoaxes, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. By the way, they turned away 21,000 people outside, so feel very good. Feel very good. We haven’t had an empty seat. You know what? We haven’t had… True. We haven’t had an empty seat, and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody’s ever seen. But we haven’t had an empty seat since your great… and this is a great first lady. Came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago. We haven’t had an empty seat.

From our rural communities to our inner cities, we’re expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. You saw that, the geniuses. You saw that. You saw that last month. They were doing predictions on one of the shows. What do you think? Well, I think 60,000. What do you think? I think 100,000. What do you think? I think 84,000. These are the ones that tell you all about how to invest. What do you think? And then they came out 225,000, the market goes up again. 225,000. 225,000. So many manufacturing jobs. So many that frankly, we’re never going to come back. Remember, you need a magic wand, right? They came back. And remember this, we’re paying interest. The past administration didn’t pay interest. They pumped money in like it was candy. And we didn’t pump money in, we took money out. And not that I was happy about that, because I disagree with it. Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow.
And we’ve set 144 records on the stock market in three years, 144 records. 144 records. Record stock market. And you know what that means? That your 401Ks are up 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. Guys come up to me. He said, “Mr. President, I just want to thank you. My wife used to look at me like I was a total loser, sir. Every year we lost money for years and years. She said what the hell is wrong with you, Henry? And this year sir, I’m up 92%. She loves to me again. She thinks I’m a genius.” 92% 401K. “She thinks I’m a genius, sir. She loves me again.” Shows what money can do, right? But that makes… And think of this. Seven million new jobs since we were elected, we were elected.

And when I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And we immediately started. We have destroyed 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We have killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi is dead. And we just took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. And the fake news doesn’t want to tell you that. They don’t want to tell you that. They don’t want to tell you. In fact, do you remember the dog? Great dog, Conan. When we took out, right? We love Conan. Conan’s a tough dog. But when we took out al-Baghdadi, Conan… Remember this? Conan got more publicity than President Trump. That’s okay. They were looking for al-Baghdadi for 16 years. We found him and we took him out. We killed another one last week. The head of Al-Qaeda. He was gone, dead. And America is respected again, respected like never before.

We’re respected again. We’re no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country, including by the way, our allies, who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies. I will tell you that. They take big advantage, but not so much anymore. We’re winning. We’re winning like never before. Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They hate the fact that we’re winning. We’re winning big. We’re winning, winning, winning. And that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They’re joining our great Republican party in droves. You see it all the time. I just spoke to some of your leaders. He said, “This is unbelievable what’s happening. This is unbelievable.”
 You know, there have never been rallies like that. Sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people. And now they have a new member of the crew, mini Mike. Mini Mike. No boxes, we call him no boxes. And I hear he’s getting pounded tonight. You know, he’s in a debate. I hear they’re pounding him. He spent $500 million so far, and I think he has 15 points. It just came out. Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15? They won’t tell you the truth. They won’t tell you the truth. MSDNC, MSDNC is worse than CNN. They’re owned by a company called Comcast. You can have Comcast, a bunch of phonies. But MSDNC is worse than CNN, and they’re all pretty bad. You know, they just came out with a poll. They just came out with a poll a little while ago. Mini Mike was at 15, and crazy Bernie was at 31. That’s a lot. And mini Mike just spent $500 million. But the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again. That’s okay, because we don’t care who the hell it is. We’re going to win. We’re going to win. We have to.
Well let me tell you, these crooked politicians, they really took away three years from us. Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that we’ve done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, we’ve done more than any administration in history. We’ve done more. But think of it, think of it. We did it with phony witch hunts. We did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time. We did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another President again. True. But with your energy and enthusiasm this November, we’re going to take back the House, we’re going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we’re thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best, greatest. I love them. Leaders in America, Arizona leaders. I want to start. Come on up here, Governor Doug Ducey. Come on up here, Doug. Come on up here. You’re going to speak in a second.

Also, I call them warriors because they fought like hell. They worked with our future Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. But we have some of your great warriors. Paul Gosar, come up here, Paul. Come up here. Andy Biggs. Andy Biggs, head of the Freedom Caucus. Andy Biggs. David Schweikert. David, come up here. A big, big star. You know about that, Doug. She became this monster star. She looked with such indignation at the other side, such disgust, Debbie Lesko. He’ll be running some day. You said your grandson? Wow. He’ll be running someday. Arizona Senate President, you know who that is, right? Karen Fann. Come up, Karen. Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Vice President of the Navajo nation, Myron Lizer. And Arizona Republican party State Chair, Kelly Ward. Kelly Ward, come up.

And we have a lot of other leaders, but we’ve got to get back to speaking. Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, I’d like to ask your great Governor… You know, he won like by 16 points. It wasn’t even a contest. You know, I’m very competitive. I want to beat him. Will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him? But he’s tough to beat. Doug Ducey, say a couple of words, please. Please.
These are great people, great people. Thank you very much. So you know, before I introduce somebody very important to all of us, to me… Also, I have to say with us tonight is an Arizona hockey great, a friend of mine. He’s a great golfer too. He’s a tough golfer. I’ll tell you, he’s tough to beat. He’s tough as hell. And if you beat him in golf, he’ll try and beat you physically. He doesn’t care. He was the toughest hockey player. He was one of these guys, he could beat you one way and if he couldn’t, he just beat them up, right? He’d beat him up. And he’s a friend of mine. He’s a great guy, Jeremy Roenik. Where’s Jeremy? Where is he? Thank you, Jeremy. He’s a winner. We’re also joined by Donald, Jr. and Kimberly. They’re great people, great. And RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldn’t tell you that… Todd Ricketts.
So finally, it’s my great honor to introduce a tremendous person, a great fighter pilot. A lot of people don’t know that. She’s a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate. She helped us so much during the impeachment hoax, she didn’t wobble one bit, Martha McSally. You know, Martha’s tough on the border. And she’s working with me to strengthen our military still further, and lower your prescription drug prices. We’re making a lot of progress. But her opponent, I have to say this Martha, a guy named Mark Kelly. Even the Democrats don’t like him much. He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment. He wants to get rid of it. The radical liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts, they’re pouring money into Kelly’s campaign, because they know that he’s a rubber stamp for crying Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, and nervous Nancy wacko Pelosi. And we’re going to have a new Speaker. But that’s why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement, and we have to all get out there and make sure that Martha McSally… She’s a warrior. Let me tell you, you don’t know. We don’t know. People don’t know, people. This one is tough as hell, and that’s what we need. Martha McSally.
We’ll be back. Thank you Martha. Well, she’s right. How about that Congressman Al Green? We can’t beat him, so we have to impeach him. How about that? That’s not what our… as they call them, the founders. How many times did you hear the name, the founders? That’s not what the founders had in mind. But we’re going to have a big, big election victory. We’re working to-
 But we’re going to have a big, big election victory. We’re working together. I don’t think the Republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now. I really don’t believe so.

So whatever you can do for Martha, we need her. It’s been so incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you for everything, Martha. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Together we’re building the world’s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. We’re inclusive. This is the Republican party. We’re inclusive.

Right here in… Right? You know that. Right here in America, right here in Arizona, we’ve created 240,000 new jobs right here. Including over 60,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here. Nobody thought it was possible. You’ve had the best year that you’ve ever had. Arizona, you’ve had the best year, the most successful year that you’ve ever had in the history of the country. It’s the best year you’ve ever had. So I’m going to take all the credit away from your governor. I don’t care.

No, we have a great team with Doug and everybody else, but you’ve had the greatest year. You know that, Doug, number one year in the history of your state. It’s an incredible achievement. Incredible achievement.

I don’t know, this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage. We’ll talk about, “Well, you had the best… In many states, the best year they’ve ever had.” Then they said, “Let’s get a new president.” I don’t think that’s going to work so easily. The country’s had the best year it’s ever had. Let’s get a new president. Let’s put in crazy Bernie. Let’s go. Crazy Bernie.

Unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years, half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration… Think of this. The average, so we’re talking about now more than three years, is the lowest for any US president in recorded history.

The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, lowest in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country. African American and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded.

The unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years. Soon to be historic. And veterans’ unemployment has dropped to a record low. We’re working with our veterans, we’re taking care of our veterans like nobody’s ever taken care of our veterans. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached the lowest level in history. Workers without a high school diploma, you have a lot of them. They left high school. They said, “I should have finished.” They left. They can’t go back. They left. We’ve achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in US history. Isn’t that great? They’re great numbers. Hispanic Americans right now, more than 500,000 own a home. More than 500,000 more own a home.

And we’ve lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls. Think of that. 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls. And happily. Not that we did anything. They have jobs and they love them. They’re making much more money and they love getting up and going for work. If they don’t like that job, they can get another one, because people are starving to get great employees right now. They’re starving to get great employees.

Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median income. Think of this. This is such a big deal. Median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country. Under President Bush, in eight years it went to $450 more. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, under a period of eight years, it went to $975. Under president Donald J. Trump… Did you ever hear of him? In only three years, including regulation cuts and tax cuts… Because the other ones raise taxes. We cut taxes by the record amount. It went to $10, 000 per family. A record. A record.

That’s why our consumer right now, our people, they’re booming with cash. That’s one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better. China had the worst year in the last 67 years. Asia’s doing poorly. Europe is doing poorly. The United States is doing great. We’re doing the best we’ve ever done. The best we’ve ever done.

To lift up forgotten communities that need investment, and these are really communities that need it the most, we created Opportunity Zones. We worked with Tim Scott, the great senator from South Carolina. His idea. He came in and saw me. I said, “Let’s give it a shot.” Nothing’s worked over the years, but this has really worked. Now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Arizona alone. From Apache to Navajo and Maricopa Counties.

We’re supporting working families by fighting pay. We are doing a job with paid family leave. We’re doing something that nobody’s ever done to this extent. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit.

Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and cutting through job, killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before. We’ve ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers. For the first time, America is now energy independent. Such beautiful words. Energy independent.

We fought wars. We did everything we could. We used to take the straits and everybody else benefited. We’d them clear so that other countries could take oil from the Middle East with… That nobody paid us. Now they’re starting to pay us a lot of money, folks. They took advantage of us. But we have everything we need right now. We have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines. The Keystone Pipeline, Keystone XL. I approved it. The Dakota Access Pipeline. I approved it. 48,000 jobs.

We’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. The worst trade deals any human being has ever seen. I said, “Who made these deals?” The worst, stupidest deals I’ve ever seen. They were good for other nations. If you like other nations, that’s great. But we’re now putting America first. It’s very simple. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations, and really, the most corrupt special interests anybody’s ever seen. To ship our jobs and our factories to other countries. We lost our taxes, we lost our workers, we lost our companies, and we did nothing about it. Now we’ve done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in.

America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA, the worst deal ever made, worst trade deal ever made, and one that was almost as bad and gave China an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the World Trade, WTO. One of the worst deals that we participated in this. By the way, we just won $7.5 billion in a lawsuit with WTO. We weren’t winning anything.

We weren’t winning anything, but they said, “I think this guy’s going to pull out.” They treated us so unfairly. We were always in the minority position. I mean, who the hell negotiated these deals? But they look at us and they say, “Look, if we’re not treated fairly, we’re gone.” All of a sudden, we’re winning all these cases. But we just won 7.5 billion. 7.5 billion. Did you know that, Doug? 7.5 billion.

But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America’s no longer for sale. America is no longer for sale. Those days are over.

Two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace NAFTA. How many times have you heard we’re going to replace NAFTA? Probably the number one reason I ran for office. Are we glad I ran for office? I think so.
It’s funny, I was watching the different… I find it fascinating. I’m watching the different returns coming in and I’m watching as much as I can of this stuff. I love it. We all love it. If you don’t love it, you’re not going to do it very well. The crazy New York Times, which was a dead newspaper when I ran, it was dead as a doornail. A month before I ran, Doug, I held up a New York Times, it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket. It was a thing. It just flew away. There was nothing. Now it’s doing very well. But you know what? Someday we won’t be here. When we’re not, those papers are in big trouble. But this thing was a dead newspaper.

But I was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they’re doing. They have Mini Mike has spent $411 million. It’s a question mark, how’s he going to… I’ll tell you how he’s going to do. He’s probably not going to get the democratic nomination. That’s how he’s going to do. But Mini Mike, $411. Then they had this idiot, Steyer. We call him impeachment Steyer. How did that work out, Steyer? He’s another beauty. The guy worked… He spent 210 million. He got one-third of 1% in Iowa. In New Hampshire he did much better. He got less than 3%. Guy’s in there for like 250 million. How did it work out, Steyer? You jerk. I never even heard of him. I never even heard of him. I turn on every time… For years, I’m turning on… Impeach him. They don’t even know why. They never say why. They don’t have any reason. Impeach the president. This guy spent a fortune on this stuff, so it worked out pretty good.

But anyway, so then I go and I look. It has Mini Mike’s… Question marks. I can give you the answer, but right now they have to have a question mark, right? Then they go down and they had other people. Some of them I like. They have Ross Perot, who honestly… It was a tough day for Bush when he joined the campaign. Because Clinton didn’t win. Ross Perot took away 19% of the votes. Didn’t Clinton get 41 or 43%? Give me a break. But that’s okay. Whatever.

But they had Ross Perot spent like 100 million, which is probably double if you bring it up to today’s dollars. Then they have different people. A friend of mine who ran, Steve Forbes, he ran twice. He was in for a lot. Then they had Donald Trump. Now, this is your own money. This is your own money. I said I’d spend a lot of money on my primaries. We’ll see how the hell we do. It’s amazing. Once you win, money comes in. It comes in pretty fast. What’s that all about? But so in the middle they had Trump, and then they had four or five that were behind me. Lot of money spent. Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss. But in the middle they have Donald Trump. It didn’t say 500 million, and it didn’t say 250 like this Steyer guy. It didn’t say… It said 70 million of my own money. I spent 70. It said, “Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States.” Right? We won.
 My father would teach me, if you could spend less and win, that’s better than spending a lot and winning. Crooked Hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost.
Crooked as hell. She’s crooked as hell. We have a double-sided justice. It’s very unfair what’s going on. Very unfair. But let’s see how it all works out, folks. Let’s see how it all works out. I hope you’re going to be happy. I hope you’re going to be happy, because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there. Dishonest scum. Dirty cops, a lot of dirty cops.

By the way, the FBI, those guys in that are incredible. But the ones on top, they were absolute scum. What they were trying to do, if that happened to Obama, or a Democrat, or especially a liberal Democrat, they’d be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already. They spied on our campaign. Remember that. After they spied, we won. Then after we won, they tried to get us out of office. It’s never happened before in the history of our country, and we can’t let that happen. We can never ever excuse it. We can never let them get away with that.

Never let them get away with it. But we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great. The last month, we ended the NAFTA… Look, you saw it. NAFTA catastrophe. That’s what it was. We ended that catastrophe. Again, I really ran because of NAFTA. I said, “How stupid.” All over the place. In your state, but you go to New England, empty factories, empty buildings. Still you have empty buildings. We lost so much. We lost 60,000 factories and plants. I signed that brand new, beautiful US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.

The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, and ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona. By the way, for people with the small farms and small businesses, if you love your children, you can now leave your companies, you can leave your farm, you can leave your ranch to your children, and you don’t have to to pay, they don’t pay a death tax. They don’t pay an inheritance tax. A big deal. That’s a big deal. So if you love your children, it’s good. If you don’t love your children, it doesn’t matter. Don’t leave it to them, if you don’t love. If your children are no good to you, don’t give them anything. Let them go out and work like hell. No, if you love…

Does anybody in this incredible audience… Man, this is a big building. Does anybody not love their children? Anybody? Do I have a hand? Do I have a… There’s a hand. You’ve got to be kidding. You’ve got to be kidding. So then you don’t care about the tax. Okay, don’t worry about it. He says, “No, I don’t care about that one.” Well, that’s good. You look like a nice guy too. He’s tough. You’d love to be his kid, wouldn’t you?

But I also took the strongest ever action to confront China’s massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports. China will invest $250 billion a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs. Nothing like that has ever happened before. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. That’s the way we want it. We are finally putting our country first. We are putting America first.

On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration. You know it almost better than anybody. Anybody, Doug. You know it better than anybody, what they’ve done on your border, but we’re stopping that border. That border is clogged, and we’ve started the big wall right in Arizona. We build a lot of wall. That’s a big one. That’s a big one. Top of the line.
 
Before I came into office, the far left’s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children. Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything. They want to give them everything. For a long period of time, they were treated… You know this before I came. They were treated far better than our veterans were treated. Now our veterans are treated great. True.

Illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year. Two billion you’re paying. Nearly 20% of Arizona’s annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem.

For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild our cities all throughout America, which is what we should be doing. Under my administration, we are finally taking care of our own citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities.
Every day, Democrats’ open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives. In Arizona alone last year, ICE officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder.
 Right here in Phoenix, an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street. This savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison. He was in prison six years. He was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it. They want to protect them.

Last year in Tucson, another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals, and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into America’s communities. Thankfully, Arizona has banned sanctuary cities. With a Republican majority in Congress, we will ban them in every state in America.

I’ll tell you what, in California… I just left California. I started off with a speech in Nevada at 7:30 in the morning. I then went to California, made two speeches. I then went someplace else. I said, “Am I finished?” No, you’ve got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people. I said, “That’s okay. That’s okay.” I said, “That’s okay.” No, I said, “That’s okay,” because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd. But you know what? Honestly, there’s tremendous energy in our nation. There’s tremendous energy in our nation. Greatest nation in the world.

Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring. The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years. And we’ve ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated.

Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year. We’ve deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13. Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country.

We’ve done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We’re building the wall, as I said, faster than ever. It will soon be almost one new mile a day. We’re looking for that.

Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders. How’s he doing tonight? 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie’s healthcare takeover of the world. Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan. But if you don’t mind, I’m not going to criticize it tonight. Let them keep going and I’ll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election. Okay? Because I don’t want him to change. Please don’t change.

Same with the Green New Deal. I don’t want to talk about it, Doug, tonight. I don’t want to talk about it.

I came up with the name Pocahontas. Too early. But fortunately, she’s self-destructed anyway. Did you ever see a phony like that? She’s a phony. She lost because she couldn’t keep it straight on her own heritage. She said she was an Indian. I said, ” I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none.” She said, “Oh,” and she panicked. She panicked, and she had a test. You know the result, 1/124th. I think I win the bet. Somewhere along the line, I think I win.

No, she… I did it too early. I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective. She’s essentially gone-zo, so… One of those things. While the socialist Democrats are try-

… one of those things. While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. And that’s what we’re getting. That’s right.

One of the big secrets. The Democrats won’t let us say it. They want to keep that as quiet as possible. Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare. And what we’ve done, we’ve gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you. Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice. We’re making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and it’s better healthcare. A lot of people don’t know this. People don’t know this. They think that’s their issue. It’s not. They failed on healthcare. We’re protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will. And by the way, we’re trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we’re managing it incredibly, but we’re trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions. Remember that. We’re trying to get rid of it, but while we’re having it, we’re managing it really much better than they did. Remember they built the $5 billion website? Remember that? It was supposed to cost $5 million. It cost $5 billion. $5 billion. I mean, you could get a kid out of high school.

I have a son. He’s a young boy, 13. He uses a computer. He could have given them a healthcare site. I would say he would have charged them $100, Barron Trump, and it would’ve worked. He’s so good. “Hi dad. How you doing, dad? How’s it going?” Bing, bing, bong. I said, “Don’t play with that while you’re talking to me.” “What’s going on, dad?” These kids are incredible, right? The kids, they make us look like babies with that. But he could have given you a great site for about $2. They spent $5 billion on a site that never worked. By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa?

And I hear, I hear, I don’t want to say it. I don’t want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do. We don’t have anything. Nobody’s running against us in so many states. It’s sort of nice. We can save the thunder, right? But I hear that in Nevada. I’m hearing bad things about their vote count. I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don’t know what the hell they’re doing. I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see … And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa. We had more votes than anybody’s ever had as an incumbent president. Same thing in New Hampshire. It’s a good sign. It’s a good sign. By a lot. By the way, by a lot.

But I’m hearing that, and I hope this isn’t the case because I’d like to find out who the hell won. We still don’t know who won in Iowa. I heard coming over here they’re still working on the count. No, no, no. He said, “You won.” Yeah, I think we did win. I think we did. Very good. That’s very good. I have to thank you, that one. That’s very good. No, we did win. Look, we are winning. We’re winning big. We have fake polls out there. These guys do fake polls. They are fake polls.

I had a poll. It’s just like it was in 2016. I’d hear these polls. I’d hear women didn’t like me, and I did great with women. I hear everyone didn’t like me. Nobody liked me. Nobody liked me. And then we won. Thank you, women. Nobody liked me 2016. No, no, I hear that. Remember, women didn’t like him, and at the end of that he did great with women. He did great with this. He did great with everybody. We did great with everybody. Remember, 306 to 223. That’s a slaughter. That’s a slaughter. Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path. There is no path, right, to 270?

I was at 269 if I did great, but they said there’s no chance. But I was at 269, so I went to Maine. I love Maine. I went to Maine. Maine’s cut in half. And one Maine has one. I went there four or five times. People are great. I won it. And they were right. There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306. These people. These people. There is no path. That’s right, Doug. They said there is no path, the fake news media. “There is no path for Donald Trump.” And then they said the evening of the election, “It’s going to be a really short night for Donald Trump. Thank God, we got rid of this guy.”

Because they did the exit polls going out, right? And I was even told, but a lot of people didn’t want to talk about it. The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but I’m not going to use that name because you’ll kill me if I use it. So I won’t use it. It’s a much better story if I use it because that’s the truth. That’s what they said. “How did you vote?” Usually, they say, “I voted for Clinton,” or, “I voted for Trump.” Right? “How’d you vote?” “None of your business.” See, I’m being nice, right? I’ll keep it that way because otherwise we’ll ruin the whole evening. They’ll say, “His language,” right? Even this tough guy in the front says, “I agree.” “How did you vote?” “No, I don’t want to tell you.” “How did you vote?” “None of your damn business. I’m not going to tell you.” “How did you vote?” “I’m not … ”

And it was like this massive number, right? Massive. So everybody, they just didn’t count that. So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton. They’re looking unbelievable. This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump. We finally will be rid of this guy. And then the numbers started coming in. The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage I’ve ever seen.
 And they knew something was going on because they didn’t pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before. Right? In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, “I’ll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks,” even though they were no way near where my area was. We were at a hotel in Midtown. We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most … we remember that beautiful stage.

It was shaped like the United States of America. And by the end, it didn’t look too good. Did you ever see more unhappy people? So they go, “Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida. They go, “Whoa, whoa, whoa.” They outspent me like five to one. Only negative ads. They’re all negative. So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing. She hated Donald Trump, but they said, “What the hell does she stand for? What does she do?” Every ad was a negative ad. So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren’t so good. They can be effective. But I think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads. Everything was negative. So nobody knew what the hell she spent.

You know, her husband said she was going to lose. Her husband’s a professional. Her husband said, “You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a Trump/Pence sign on every lawn I’ve ever seen. You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary. You better go to Wisconsin.” She said, “No, we haven’t lost Wisconsin in 36 years”. “No, no, Hillary, you got to go there. I’m telling you, I don’t like what I saw.” “No, what do you know?” He’s a professional politician. She wasn’t. It’s one of those little problems in life. So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. Right? And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2% of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot.

They refused, the fake news refused to call it. I kept saying, “We won Pennsylvania. Why don’t they call it?” It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they’re crooked. They are fake. And I said, “Why don’t they call Pennsylvania?” But some beautiful things happened. And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever. The great, great, great state of Ohio. Remember? Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, “Well, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio.” And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now we’re up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why? We’re bringing back jobs. We’re bringing back factories. Everybody’s working. Nobody’s ever had a better year than we’ve been having. And we’ve been doing it for a long time, right? Almost from the beginning.

And don’t let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression. We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on. And I’ll tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts. We freed up our nation to go back to work. True.

So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now they’re pouring back in. The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin’s doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking. You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products. Okay? So what happens is this, we’re working on healthcare. We’re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. We’ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. We’ve totally transformed veteran’s healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if you’re in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena’s in trouble, but if you’re in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. It’s incredible what’s happening. People would go to Europe. They’d go to Asia. If they had no money, they’d go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before they’re approved. Think of that. Before they’re approved. And we’re very importantly combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths. The overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years, and life expectancy is rising again in our nation.

We’ve launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer’s disease. We’re making tremendous progress, and we’re pursuing new advances in neo-medical research. Think of that, neonatal research, the numbers are incredible. What’s happened is incredible, to care for America’s youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We have tremendous energy. Tremendous energy.

Everybody says to me, “Where do you get the energy?” Because I love what we’re doing. I see the results, and they’re happening faster than you even think. You see the numbers. They’re happening faster than you would even think. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We are the party with big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right? Right? To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life. There’s been nothing like this. I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats. I did it with the Republicans, and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican party. The Democrats did not do it. They could never have done it.

To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 218 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. This is a record. And as you know, I have nominated, and we have confirmed, two great new Supreme Court Justices: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including nearly $200 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Right? I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been trying to get it for 52 years. And for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You saw that. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Arizona.

At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. It is. This election is so important. It’s the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. You’re the forgotten people no more. Right? No deplorables, right? No deplorables. Who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster? But you know, she used the worst word. What was the word she used? Irredeemables, right? I thought that was the problem. No, it was deplorable. So what the hell do I know about politics? She said, “You’re irredeemable and deplorable.” I said, “Oh, that irredeemable’s terrible.” The next day people are showing up. Women, “I’m a deplorable.” Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp, which is vicious, horrible, ugly, and evil. Much worse than I thought. But we’re getting there and not pleasant. A bunch of really bad people, very dishonest people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words and phrase. I love the phrase, Made in the USA. Made in the USA.

We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within now nine years. We started a year ago. Can you imagine that? We’re doing that, and it’s going to happen. Who would have thought we could have done that? We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, and you know this. You know it’s under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend it. It’s under siege. It’s under siege. You see it in Virginia. They want to take away the guns. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.

we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust. From Tucson to Tombstone, right? Do you agree? You agree, right? Look at him. He’s agreeing, this guy.
He’s agreeing. No more censorship is right. No more evil. No more crimes. You’re right. From Yuma to Mesa and from Flagstaff to right here in Phoenix, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. Arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors, great prospectors, cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, braved the blazing sun, and it is hot here. I’ve been here during the summer. I want to tell you, it’s seriously hot. Of course, didn’t they say that President Clinton, when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf, it was 121 degrees that day? I don’t know about that. I don’t know about that. What do you think he was doing with the Attorney General? I remember he said, “Oh, I just happened to see she was … I was here to play golf. It was 120 degrees out.” I don’t know.

A lot of crooked stuff went on. I wonder what they talked about. I’m sure it wasn’t that she would become a Supreme Court Justice. I’m sure it wasn’t that they were going to extend her tenure as Attorney General. She was a real beauty. I’m sure it wasn’t. I’m sure it was nothing. They spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren. Right? Can’t let it happen, folks. Can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen. You fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day than ever before. Great, great, great citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and with your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Do you like winning? Because not very long ago you weren’t winning, and I don’t want you … I told this a few times during the campaign. Haven’t used it in a long time, but I don’t want you going to your great governor. He’s a great governor, Doug Ducey. I don’t want you going to your governor saying, “Governor, governor, we just can’t stand winning so much. Please go see the president in the oval office. Governor, the people of Arizona don’t want to keep on winning. It’s too much governor. It’s not even fair to the rest of the planet. Please tell him, Governor Ducey, please tell him, ‘President, the people of Arizona have won too much. We don’t want to keep on winning.'” And I’ll look at Doug Ducey, and I’ll say, “Doug, I’ve a lot of respect for you, Doug. You won by 16 points. That means a lot. But Doug, I don’t care what you say. We’re going to keep on winning, and we’re going to win like never before. And the people of Arizona are going to love it.”

And he’s going to say, “Thank you, Mr. President. I’m going back home.” The fact is, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Arizona, the best is yet to come. That’s right. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Thank you. singing)",20/2/20

Well, thank you very much. And hello Las Vegas. Great to be with you. They have a big election tomorrow. We’ve already won the state. We’ve already won. I like ours better. We just take it. Just take it. We’ve won it. I like it that better.

You know they say they’re going to have a lot of problems tomorrow. I hate to tell you this. I don’t know. Have you heard? I hear their computers are all messed up. Just like they were in Iowa. They’re not going to be able to count their vote. They’re going to tell you about healthcare. They’re going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets, but they can’t count votes. They just can’t count them. They can’t count votes, but they’re saying they may not be able to do it again. They’re still trying to tell us. I called up yesterday, how are they doing in Iowa? Was that two weeks ago? They say we’re getting close. They’re not getting close, they’ll never know. They’ll never know, but I hear the same thing could happen tomorrow. I hope it doesn’t, actually.
I hope it doesn’t, but I’m delighted to be back in a state I love. I have a beautiful building right down the road. With the proud, hardworking patriots of Nevada. You’re going to say Nevada. You say that wrong, you got problems. You say Nevada, they go, what the hell? Got to be Nevada.

With your help this November, we’re going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Nevada in a big beautiful landslide. Now, we have some special people here, you know the special very special people.

And we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports. Some people say it was the single greatest moment in the history of sports. It was called the miracle on ice. Do you remember that? That was when the Russians had a team assembled. That was probably, they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled. They were unbelievable. And our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before, and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3, and the USA was not on top, and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing, but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States men’s hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics.

Incredible. That was incredible. Most of you remember that. I’m looking. We’ve got a lot of young ones, but we’ve got a lot of people that remember that. A lot of people. And by the way, we got the Olympics coming back or coming to Los Angeles. Thank you. Thank you President Trump. Thank you President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you President Trump. Eight years. Eight years, 2028 you know what? Unless I’m still president then, which is a distinct possibility, I won’t be here, and you know what they’ll do? I’ll say, how’s the Olympics going? Does anybody have a ticket for the president that got the Olympics to come here? They’ll say, I want to thank and they’ll thank hundreds of people, but they won’t thank you president that I’m the one that pulled it off. But that’s okay. 2028 Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. It’s going to be great.

And we worked with the mayor of Los Angeles. He was great. He called up and we gave him a lot of help. I was president elect then because the president didn’t want to get involved. He didn’t want to get involved in getting the Olympics, so they called me and I was president elect, hadn’t taken office. Then I got involved and I’ll tell you, they were happy we got involved. It was great. It’s going to be very exciting today.

We are thrilled to have with us 14 players of that really incredible gold medal team. Give him a big hand. And they were amazed. They said, boy is a big crowd. I said, it’s only because you guys are coming.

This day was supposed to be for this evening. And I said, let me get back to Washington, do it early. So we gave you almost no notice. You have thousands of people outside, thousands of people inside. You had to see, we were in Iowa we were in New Hampshire. You saw what happened in Colorado last. That was unbelievable. Every place we go it’s the same. It’s been incredible.

I don’t know if you saw the pictures last night of the outside in Colorado. It was incredible. It was. You could have filled that arena up four times and it was a big arena, and it’s something.

So I hated to do it to you at 12 o’clock but I said, let’s go. I want to get back. We got to deal with China. We got to deal with Russia. We got to deal with North Korea, South Korea. We got to deal with the rest of the world. Get my people back. We got to get the hell out of here, right? But we have a lot of time. I’d like now to invite these incredible sport legends to join me on stage. A friend of mine and a very good golfer, by the way, Captain Mike he rode a bike. Mike. Where’s Mike? Where is he? Mike. Do you know who he is? He’s a fake handicap is what he is. Say something Mike.
But just tell them, am I a good athlete and am I a good golfer?
Thanks Mike. That was some goaltending right? How many did you rebuff?
He was like a pinata.
So Mike, that was great. Goaltender Jim Craig. So Jim rebuffed come here, Jim. Great goaltender, great goaltender. They didn’t know what was happening. They kept shooting. He doesn’t know how many you rebuffed. How many did you rebuff?
37. So let me ask you, was that as goaltender, because that was incredible. Was that the greatest game you ever played? You’ve had a lot of great games. But was that the greatest game you’ve ever played?

It was slightly important. 37. 37. Bill Baker. Bill, come up. Bill Baker. Dave Christian, Ken Morrow, Jack O’Callahan, Mike Ramsey.
Those legs took a beating. Mark Wells, Neil Brotton, John Harrington, Rob McClanahan, Buzz Schneider, Dave Silk, Phil Verchota, and a great coach and assistant coach at the time, Craig Patrick.
They said four more years, 12 more years left for them. Look at that. Look at the press. Hey Mike, look at the fake news back there. It’s a lot. I always say that’s like the Academy Awards used to be. This year, we had a movie, they said best movie, they announced the movie from South Korea. I said, what’s that all about? The movie was made in South Korea. Look, I get along great with South Korea, but you know, I never saw that one before. They used to go best foreign movie, but now we do it that way.

I don’t get it, but that’s what it used to be and this is really an incredible time. I’ll tell you what, for our country, that’s why I like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do. Nobody can do it like us.

We’re the greatest country in the world again. We have the greatest people. We have the greatest military by far. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. Jobs are booming, incomes are surging, poverty is plummeting. Factories are returning confidence is soaring, like these guys, the confidence is soaring, but you know, we do have somebody that I’d like to point out because this team is, they had a coach, and that coach was a very inspirational coach, would you say Mike? And I’d like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about Coach Brooks because he was very, very, he was really a big, he was a big heart on this team. Please.
So tell me one thing, one thing. So I see those tears. That means you think, you miss him and you love him. Right? Was he actually a nice guy? Because he looked tough. Mike was just saying he was brutal, but he was a good guy, right?
Tough but great. Thank you very much. Thanks Kelly. Thank you all. Greatest sports story could be number one.
So a lot of people, a lot of these sports experts, sports writers have voted that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement. I think so, yeah? They put it number one, certainly top five. In the history of our country, we have a lot of things that we’ve done to break records. We’re going to go over them, but we’ve broken a lot of records now, but I want to thank that great team for being with us. Very inspirational. This is a big day. The anniversary. Thank you fellas. Thank you.

In my state of the union address, I proudly declare that we are in the midst of the great American comeback and we’re just getting started.

After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades. By the way, I think they’re starting another one. Did you see that? I see these phoneys. These are the do nothing Democrats. They said today that Putin wants to be sure that Trump gets elected. Here we go again. Here we go again. Did you see it? A story. Aren’t people bored? Now, does that include because a couple of weeks ago, crooked Hillary said Chelsea Gabbard, right. Tulsi Gabbard and right?
She was a Russian agent. Tulsi and also Stein from Jill Stein. I don’t know Jill Stein. I never met the woman. She is a Green Party candidate or was they said she’s an agent of Russia. I don’t know her and I don’t know Tulsi. The only thing I know about both of them is they’re not agent. They are not agents of Russia. These people are sick. That’s pencil neck, pencil neck again. Little pencil. No, I just see it again. I was told that was happening. I was told a week ago. They said they’re trying to start a rumor. It’s disinformation. That’s the only thing they’re good at. They’re not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats. That Putin wants to make sure get elected. Listen to this. So doesn’t he want to see who the Democrat’s going to be? Wouldn’t you rather have, let’s say Bernie? Wouldn’t he rather that Bernie who honeymooned in Moscow? Wouldn’t that be?

These people are crazy. That’s all they think about. They don’t think about the country. They don’t think about jobs. They don’t think about lowering your drug costs. Infrastructure. These people are crazy. Trust me, I like what we’re doing and I love this country. I love this country.

Now, and I campaigned on it, at the same time we want to get along with Russia, we want to get along with China, we want to get along with all these countries. Who the hell needs to have conflict? But these people are sick, they are sick people. The radical left’s attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure.

And by the way, you saw today, single best day I’ve ever had is the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you, because the real numbers are higher, but any poll they give you as a fake. But Wisconsin, the great state of Wisconsin, I was leading by many, many, many points against every one of these characters. Can you believe it? We got a new one. Mini Mike. How did he do in the debate the other day? Mini Mike. Here’s a box Mike. Here Mike. Mini Mike. He was a beauty.

What happened huh? He couldn’t breathe. What happened? Mike would like to know how about that Pocahontas screaming at him. She forgot. She forgot that she lied about her own heritage. She said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones. That was the only thing. Remember what I said, I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none. Right? I have none. To the best of my knowledge, wouldn’t mind having some, but I happen to have none. And she choked and she went out and got a report done. One, 1 thousandth and 24 you know what that means? That means probably I do have more. Now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him? Why? Because he was gasping for breath. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. She’s hitting me too hard. Pocahontas. Well, she won that debate cause Mike could not respond.
That’s what they all said. They all said that. That’s funny. I won, they’re all shouting. It’s not me that’s saying it. Fake news. You fake news people. No, they all said it though. Who won the debate? Trump. You know what? The way I look at it, when fake news CNN oops, there goes the camera off. Red light just went off. See, I can tell every one of them. I know them by heart. I know the operators. I know the camera men. They’re okay. They’re all on our side by the way. They’re screamed at. Get that camera off. I don’t want to do that. Get that camera off, or it’s going to be you job. All right, I’m sorry. Precedent.

But how bout MSDNC? They’re worse than CNN. And they’re owned by people that really are bad. I think they’re very bad for our country. The owners of Comcast, rotten company, bad for our country, very bad. They try, they have all these PR things to try and keep their image nice and clean. What they do on television is so disgusting. I think in the old days you had to have licenses for this stuff, right? They can say whatever they want to say. Let’s see what happens over the next period of time. Bunch of dishonest people. Comcast, terrible company. Terrible people running that company. And you know what, I had Celebrity Apprentice, I had the Apprentice on for 14 seasons, 14 seasons, and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass. Please sign. Please. Please sign.
 It’s an interesting story. They came and we signed, you know who signed me, Jeff Zucker. It’s one of the only things he’s done good in broadcasting, but I signed and NBC, as you know, is owned by Comcast, but I signed and they figured the show would be a total failure. So they only signed me for one season. You know I was going to have it. It was go on and then the show goes, started at ten went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two. It went to one. I had the number one show in all of television. Number one. It was a phenomenal and the final episode, remember that? With the, you remember that? Do you remember the final? We had, I don’t know, it was one of the biggest shows of the year. It was a tremendous success there.

But here I was, I signed with NBC and they didn’t even want to waste the ink on an option. Usually they have an option for not, you know, just like they didn’t do it. You stupid people. So they paid me very little for the first season I think $25,000 a show, which is considered not good. That’s okay. It was fun. I didn’t know it was going to be success, you know? Hey, just like this was successful. It’s a recent.
Because when I left and Arnold Schwarzenegger and I like Arnold said some very nice things, so I’m not, but the show did not exactly succeed when I left, but I had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and I said, no, I’m going to run for president but I’ll never forget.

I looked at, I didn’t know anything about this business and I had an agent, wonderful guy from William Morris, and he said, sir, I don’t want you to sign. No business show has ever done well on network television. Well, it’s not business, it’s entertainment, celebrity. Sir, I don’t want you to sign. Sir, don’t sign. I said, yeah, okay. But I have a problem. I shook the hand of somebody I have to.

And Mark Burnett was great. He was my guy and but we shook hands. So I have to, but I agreed, you know, I didn’t know that no business or no business type show had ever succeeded on a network television. So he said, I don’t want you to sign sir, break it. I said, I can’t break it. Can’t break it. Anyway, so the show I said started at ten, went to nine, went to became, it was the number one show all of a sudden, and the agent called me up and he said, sir, I remember it was six in the morning. I was in bed. He said, sir, the show just went to number one. I’d love to see you because I think I’m entitled to more money. I said, you didn’t want me to do the show. Well, not really. I mean, I was okay. He said, I’d really like more money. I said, Jim, I like you very much, Jim, you’re fired. Get out.

Anyway, I had 14 great seasons over about 11 years because it was so successful, they kept… They would have run it. Remember when they did the three hours, the whole night was the Apprentice. I said, wait a minute. Gone With the Wind, to mention the movie a second time, Gone With the Wind is shorter. They had the Apprentice on for three hours. I said even I think it’s too long. You can’t put it up for three. You got leave a little bit like I want to come back next week.

But they had it on for three weeks. We did fantastically with it. Comcast did great. NBC did great. They wanted me to sign for another three years. I said, no, I’m going to for president. And that was actually the time when I knew I was going to run. Because you know how they were paying a lot of money and whether you’re rich or not, it’s still a lot of money. I don’t care how rich you are. It’s a lot. Millions and millions of dollars. And I said no, I’m going to run for president. And I did that. But from the day I ran, they went from being, you know one…

But from the day I ran, they went from being wonderful, they were nice. They were nice. I guess if I didn’t do well with the show they wouldn’t have been nice because they weren’t nice to other people that failed. People that didn’t have good ratings, that business is a very simple business. If you have good ratings, you can treat them like garbage. If you have bad ratings, you can say, “Sir, I really respect you so much.”

Get out of here. Get him out of my yard. They’re very ruthless people. But Comcast is a rotten company. They forgot totally. And they are worse than CNN. I will tell you that right now. Comcast is worse than CNN. We should call it Comcast, because that’s their beautiful maiden name, Comcast. They’re worse than CNN.

I’ll, tell you something about CNN. Jake Tapper, today he put out… Now I know you don’t like him. I know. Who likes him? Who the hell can like him? I think his wife likes him. Actually. I really believe she does. But let me just tell you, he put out a couple of social media posts today, because I never call it tweet, I call it social media because it’s much bigger than tweet.

What we have, Dan Scavino. The great Dan Scavino. We have won five sites. We’re number one on Twitter, we’re number one on Facebook, and the whole world. The whole world. So it’s powerful. But Jake Tapper put out some things, basically saying, I believe it, that’s the way I read it, that the new Russian thing that started yesterday, that Putin wants to be sure that Trump, which give me a break. Give me a break. But Jake Tapper said it ain’t so, and if he did say that because they were a little complex, they can turn them around, or when Zucker sees him and said, “Why did you put that? I want that deleted and I want you to do a different one.” But he did say that. So I respect that because it’s another hoax story. But we’re standing up for the defense of our constitution, for our freedom, and democracy itself. You know that.

I got to get that. Hey, Bobby? Bobby? See that guy? I love that shirt. Bobby, I don’t know. He looks like a nice guy. Can you please walk him up, even if you have about five. Come here, come here. Come here. Come here. You got to see this shirt. You got to see this shirt. I love it.

I’ve got to order me one that I can ride around. Come on. Come on up here. He looks safe. He doesn’t look like he’s going to start a fist fight. He’s a good fan, I guess. You got to see this shirt. I love it. Is there any place that’s more fun than a Trump rally? Right?
 How many rallies have you been to?
80? 80? 80. He said 80 rallies. Come up here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Look at these two guys. These guys are serious. These are serious fans, right? Are you with him? Are you with him? Are you with him? You’re with him?
Come on. Come up here. Man.
And look at this guy Come on.
Thank you, fellas.
Wow. I just said, “How long have you two been together?” I figured they’d say, “We’re married.” He met her at the rally in Colorado. Can you believe this? Can you believe it? Man, did he get lucky. They both got lucky, right? They both got lucky. Well, that’s cool. No, I just see there’s so much stuff out here. It’s genius, actually. While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with viral hoaxes, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. As you heard, we added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Way above anticipated schedule. And that makes 7 million new jobs since the election. The number was supposed to be under 2 million and we added 7 million. And remember, if I give you wrong numbers, the fake news is going to have headlines.
“Trump gave you wrong…” I mean, it’s very tough. I’ve got to be very careful. Even if I give you wrong in the wrong way, they’ll say it was wrong. I said, “Yeah, but it was wrong in the low way.” No, that’s no good either. Got to be very precise with these characters. The Democrats don’t have to be, but we have to be. We’ve destroyed he ISIS territorial caliphate 100%, we killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al Baghdadi is dead. Al Baghdadi is dead. 17 years. They looked for him. 17 years.

Al-Baghdadi. One of the first things I did when I came in. He’s the founder of ISIS and when I came in three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. And I said, “You got to knock it out.” We knocked it out of Syria, and, Iraq and other places. We really knocked at 100%.

Remember I wanted to leave. I said, “All right.” We were at 96%, then 98, then 99%. I said, “Let some of these other countries do it.” Wouldn’t you say, right? So what happened is I wanted to leave and they said, “No, no, no, we want 100%.” So we wait and stayed. We got 100%, then we moved them all out of Syria, except we did keep the oil. You noticed that, right? We kept the oil. Sorry. They said, “He left soldiers in Syria.” Yeah, I did to keep the oil, if you don’t mind. Which is what we should have done in Iraq too, by the way.

I would have done that. I’m making a lot of money with all that oil. But you remember that whole thing, that whole… I said, “You got to find Al Baghdadi.” I’ve been saying that actually for two years. I had a lot of other things to do the first year, like fight off the Democrats. These crazy Democrats with their hoaxes. Think of it.

If they use their genius, because they are genius at that stuff, right? They’re really good. They can take nothing. They can take a perfect phone call made to the Ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure. He doesn’t even know what’s going on and they can take this perfect call. Thank goodness I had a transcriber. Do you agree with it? Because the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was.

So when I released the call, when I released the transcripts, they died. They said, “Oh we got a problem.” They never thought I was going to do it, but I had no choice. I had to because I had to show they’re liars. But think of it, they can take something like that, a perfect phone call, or they’ll take just out of thin air they can make something up.

And they ended up today, front page, New York Times. They used to call it the eighth column. That’s the big column on the right. I don’t know. The papers become so small. I don’t know if they have an eighth column anymore. They used to have the eighth column, was a big deal, right? That was the big deal. Today it’s too narrow. Think they’re probably… After I’m gone, they won’t have any columns. That’s why eventually they’re going to support me.

Eventually, the Times and the Washington post, which will be dead as a doornail after I leave, and the CNN, it’ll be an obsolete business, the cable business. MSDNC will be out of business. You know, cable was supposed to be obsolete and now they’re doing the highest numbers they’ve ever done. If an airplane goes down with 700 people, they don’t cover it. If it’s not Trump related, they don’t cover it. It’s got to be Trump or Trump related. So if a plane goes down and it’s total devastation, if the ship goes down, if the Titanic-
If the Titanic equivalent went down, they wouldn’t cover it unless I was on the sucker. It’s true. They wouldn’t cover it. The fake news would not cover the equivalent of the Titanic.
But you know what they’re going to do before the election? They’re going to say, “We want to just say something. We’re going to endorse the president.” You know why? Because they’ll be out of business. Can you imagine if they had to cover mini Mike? Who I don’t think, I think he’s gone, but you know what? He’ll spend another 500 million. Don’t forget I spent 70 and I won, of my money. In other words, they said, and this was in the New York Times, I said the other night in Colorado.
 37:04)
I spent 70, mini Mike so far has spent almost $500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by Pocahontas. Pocahontas. And she’s mean, isn’t she? Did you see that? Do you see the anger on her face? That nervous energy. She’s jumping up and down. She’s a mess. But no, no, she’s mean. Right? Right? That face is just… “You want to get him?” She said, “I got him. I want to see those agreements.” “I,” “You open up those agreements.” This poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and each one’s a disaster. He said, “I don’t want to open those agreements. Nobody told me this was going to happen.”

Said, “Actually, sir.” “Nobody told me. Get me out of here.” After the debate, he went backstage, fired a lot of people. He said, “How the hell did you get me into this thing?” But Pocahontas was really mean, but she’s going to be easy. I hope it’s her. It’s not going to be her.

She made a little comeback the other night because she took mini Mike to the cleaners. But it’s not going to be here. It can’t be [ 00:11:28]. Can’t be, I don’t think. Alfred E. Neuman, ladies and gentlemen, introducing president Alfred E. Neuman. Nobody knows because you’re all too young. Nobody knows who Alfred… it’s Mad Magazine.

They all said… No. Howdy Doody. See nobody knows who Alfred E. Neuman is. Only the real aficionados. They’re the ones and they love it. But that’s only 15% of the crowd, right? Am I right? Better than Howdy Doody. Howdy Doody.

But he’s got to learn. He’s got to worry about his own city. It’s going to hell, so he’s got to worry. Because that city’s got a lot of problems. I don’t get the whole thing, but he’s not a bad debater, I will say. He’s probably the best up there. And Bernie is too emotional. He’s screaming, going crazy. And Biden is angry. Biden is angry. Everything’s anger. [ 00:39:26] And that’s what happens when you can’t get the words out. No it does.

That’s what happens, right? When you can’t get the words out, you get angry. You get angry because you can’t get the words. That might happen to me someday. Can you imagine if that happened to me? Man, would I be a bad guy. I’d be the meanest man in history. No, but Biden is very angry.

He gets angrier, and angrier, and angrier. He’s changed. And then you have the Tom. Yeah. He said Tom Steyer. Tom said, ” Mister impeachment.” How did that work out, Tom? Thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing.

How did that work out? This schmuck spends $250 million dollars, he ends up with one third of a percent in Iowa. But maybe that could be Rick, because they still don’t have any idea what he got. Maybe he won Iowa, they took it away from him. No, but he was substantially below it. All I know, it said 1% and an arrow left.

So he spends 250 million, Tom Steyer. Never heard of this guy. Who is he? Where did he get his money? Who is he? He was in the coal business, did you know that? This guy, this phony is a big environmentalist. He made his money, a lot of it, in the coal business. Nobody knows that, but he’s a fake.

Remember when he walked up to Bernie the other day. “Hi Bernie. Hi.” Oh, and he was having a fight with Pocahontas, right? Is this the greatest? Mark Burnett said, “This is the greatest reality show in history.” He said, “You can take The Apprentice, and you can take Survivor, and you can take every other reality show ever made, multiply it times 10,000, and you still don’t have what we have. And even the CAS.” He did say this. You got the perfect president. You got the perfect first lady. How about the first lady? You got the perfect kids. The kids, though. Those beautiful kids. My beautiful kids. They had such a great life, before I did this. Sorry, kids. Sorry. My beautiful Ivanka. She had such a great life. She Had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell. She’d just put her name on it and she said, “Daddy, does it matter? I want to come to Washington and help people get jobs.”

Right? Ain’t that true? And she left the company. And when you leave a company, all of a sudden it doesn’t do as well. I wouldn’t say that I exactly helped talking about the wall and other things, but she left the company, came to Washington and she said 500,000 jobs. That was her goal. And she did that in the first month. She actually did.

She’s gotten these great companies like Walmart, and many others, Exxon, she’s gotten them to take millions of people. She’s now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies. It’s incredible. 15 million. And she’s smart. She got it figured out, but most people can’t, but she does. But all they do is give them heat. They work so hard. And could you imagine you take Biden’s son. Can you imagine?

I deal with all these big companies and these great, great countries. I think I could get my sons 25 board chips for millions of dollars a piece. My kids would be [ 00:43:21]. But you know what? We don’t do any of that stuff. We don’t do that stuff. We don’t do it. The kid got $3 million dollars, 83,000 a month and he didn’t have a job until his father became vice president. And speaking of vice presidents and speaking also of reality television, because it’s the greatest show of all time, right? Look at us. Look.

We told you, what, last night? Little change here, folks. We’re going to move it up from eight o’clock in the evening until 12 o’clock in the afternoon. Little change. Just a minor change. Because I have to get back to Washington to work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun. But speaking to vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents, if you become president, the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible, horrible vice president. So if the idiots ever want to impeach you, they have to say, I can’t impeach him. Look who we have. I have the perfect vice president. I have the greatest in the world. I have the greatest vice president.

I don’t know. I got the great ones. I said, “I can’t do that.” I picked a great guy. He’s done a fantastic job. He’s been a great vice president. But it is true. I could have picked, I’ll give you names, but don’t want to do that because I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But there are plenty of them out there.

They’re mostly out there and I don’t want to do that. But Mike Pence has been great. But tell me, is it perfect casting the whole thing? And this isn’t about casting, this is about real life. But when Mark Burnett said to me the other day, he said, “The greatest reality show of all times, times of million.” That’s exactly except for one thing, we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before.

Right? Right? So, we took out Al Baghdadi and then we just took out two weeks ago the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani of Iran, ending his evil reign of terror forever. He’s the father of the roadside bomb. When you see our beautiful people walking around with no legs, they’re walking, and trying to walk so hard, and they’re really in rough shape.

Incredible the job that doctors do at Walter Reed and some of these hospitals. And they get them to a point where sometimes they really can, they walk around, but it’s hard. And they lose legs, and they lose arms. That was [ 00:46:14] he’s the father of the… he loved the roadside bomb. He thought it was a great thing. Where is he now?

Soleimani. And I’ll tell you what, you know who’s happy about it? The people of Iran are happy and even the leaders of Iran, because the leaders of Iran were afraid of him. Okay? And the fact is, America is respected again. We’re winning. We’re winning all over. We’re winning in Washington that Democrats keep losing their minds. That is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement.

It’s not even a party, it’s a movement. They’re joining the Republican party. It’s true. We have a lot of… Look at the energy in this room. They’re all. They’re all. Look, we’re a unified party. The Republican party has never been unified like it is today.

I’ll show you. I could say, “We’re going to go over to the Hill. No, we’re going to go over to someplace and we’re going to do a rally at eight o’clock tonight.” We’d have tens of thousands of people there. There’s never been this. Ronald Reagan was great. I thought he was a great guy, great president, didn’t like his policy on trade. That’s okay. Trade.

But if he came to Las Vegas, you know they’d have a ballroom, and they’d have 500, maybe a thousand people. What we’re doing… And this isn’t even, I must say this, I don’t want to tell you this, this is not election season. Because we’re nine months away. Election season is when you’re two months away. We’re not even in election season and we have more enthusiasm now. Believe it or not, then we had even before the election in 2016. It’s true. It’s too early. It’s too early. It’s true. We have a great gentleman and a woman with us, a friend of mine, mister and misses Sheldon Adelson, right over here. Great, great person. Two great people. He’s got so much money, he doesn’t know what the hell to do with it. He owns the Sands Hotel. That’s like one of the smaller businesses.

Sheldon, that’s like your small business, right? He is a great guy. She’s an incredible, she’s a doctor, and she studies addiction, and drugs, drug addiction, all sorts of addictions. And she knows more about that subject, I think, than anybody, and she works hard and she doesn’t need it. He does not need the money that she brings in. Okay?

He also happens on the paper. He owns the paper. You own the paper in town, right? They wanted like a couple of hundred million dollars too much. You said, “Give it to them. It’s peanuts. What the hell difference does it make? We want to thank the Adelsons. They’ve been incredible fans and they love Israel. They love Israel. I just saw him sitting there. I didn’t know they were here. I just see him sitting there. He’s something.
The chairman of the Nevada Republican party, who’s really been great. He’s been with me for a long time and he’s a very committed man. Make America great again. Oh, oh, oh. Let’s do a poll quick. Just quick. I’ll never get rid of MAGA because I’m superstitious. But we just hit an all time high with the stock market. Our military is rebuilt. You just got the greatest tax cuts in history, the greatest rate, regulation cuts, and all this stuff. So, let me ask you this.

So, “Make America great again,” it sort of doesn’t work quite as well. So now we have keep America great and we have the new hat. It’s higher, stiff. It’s like a billboard, right? I call it the billboard. It’s a billboard. So let’s go just that. Because I am very surprised by it. We’re going to keep them both, but I just curious if we did go to one, “Make America great again?” ” Keep America great?”

I can’t. I would have said that’s impossible. “Make America great again,” is the greatest phrase. A lot of people, again, fake news, I think will agree to it. It’s the greatest phrase ever used in politics. It’s the greatest phrase. Now, who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say, “Oh, let’s go with a new phrase.” Right?

But we’re going to keep it. So we have to keep MAGA. But now we have CAG, now we have CAG. So we have a both. I just don’t have the courage to get rid of the one. It would be too disrespectful. Too disrespectful. But Michael McDonald, I want to thank you and the members of the Nevada Republican central committee. You’re all here. They’re great people. And the man came here. He loves us. He’s been with us. Rick Harrison of the world famous gold and silver pawn shop. Rick Harrison.

You better win, Michael. Otherwise, that’s the last time I’m introducing you like that. I hear we’re up. I hear we’re doing nicely. I hear we’re doing great. And by the way, the union, I have a lot of respect for that union. Last time, I had a strike in my building during the election. It’s the only reason we would have won this state. Brilliantly to save three cents. I could have settled the strike before the election. I wanted to save $2 total.

That was a brilliant move. And then we had some guy running. A guy named [ 00:25:55]. And he wasn’t too good. He didn’t do too good. But we almost won this state despite… I had a big strike. Had thousands and thousands of union guys. They had it, look, they wanted, wanted to show us. But I think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us. They’re Teamsters, so many of the unions.

Because I’m for the working man and woman, whether you’re union or non-union. Some States are all union, some states are no union. But we get them all. And I think we’re going to have tremendous success. And a lot of the Democrats are going to ruin the healthcare programs that these unions have. The unions have worked hard on healthcare and they’re going to ruin them.

They’re going to take away… Well, we’re going to… you can lose 180 million people off of great private healthcare. So we’ll see what happens. But a lot of the Democrats want to do that. They think it’s wonderful. But together we’re building the world’s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society. That’s true. Since my election, over 125-

That’s true. Since my election, over 125,000 new jobs have been created right here in Nevada, including over 40,000 new Nevada manufacturing and construction jobs. A 30% increase. The national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century, and soon we’re going to have that be a historic number like so many of the others. The average unemployment rate for my administration, this is the coolest of them all, is the lowest for any United States president in recorded history. That’s pretty good. When I’m in a debate, they’re saying, “we’re going to do this.” I say, “listen, we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country.” African American unemployment, Hispanic American. Hispanic, we got a lot of Hispanic. I love Hispanic. Who in this audience is Hispanic? Yeah, we’re doing great. Well, we should be doing great. You have the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded. Asian Americans, likewise the lowest ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time historic low. People I love, people I might’ve helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability. The veteran’s unemployment rate drop to the lowest record. Lowest in history.

The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all time historic low and you got to remember they’re back there checking every word. They’re going,” oh, my god. He’s right.” I can’t say it because I got all these maniacs back there. They’re trying to find… “He put the comma in the wrong place. He didn’t make that word plural, therefore he lied.” Now I’ve got to be very accurate because all these numbers, they check them out. “They’re in there, checking them out. Check on the African American unemployment, please.” Please tell me it’s not historic. These people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth. Not all of them. Workers without a high school diploma. We have millions of people that didn’t go through high school. They left. They had problems, good problems, bad problems, families where they don’t have the money. They didn’t get a high school diploma. They’ve achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the United States.

Those are important groups of people. Half a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home. Now, Hispanic have done so good. And by the way, you know who understands the border, because we are building that wall like crazy. Remember, they also said, “if you build the wall you’ll lose the Hispanic vote.” I said, “I got to do what’s right. You know who understands the border better than anybody? You know who understands crime at the border better than anybody? The Hispanics understand it and they don’t want to be working and have people come and take their job. Have people come in where they can’t pay for their house, have people come in who are very bad people.” You have some very bad people. You have murderers and rapists, and we have set all sorts of records at the border, but we’re up to 122 miles of wall, and it is true. The people that understand it the best are Hispanic. So, thank you. We got to make our country safe. We’ve lifted 10 million people off of welfare. Median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country. Think of that. I say it all the time. President Bush, eight years, $450. President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years, $ 975. President Donald John Trump, three years. It’s actually less when they did the numbers. Three years, including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts. Three years.

So, you had 450, 975, that’s eight and eight. Now we’re down to three years, a little less, three years, $ 10,000 per family a year. 10,000 a year. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats. I deal with them. They’re not good. It’s called the swamp. We’ve ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, reducing your prices. Part of that number is all of the money that we save at the pump and on electric. I also recently took action on an issue Nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years. Yucca mountain. You know Yucca mountain? My budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at Yucca mountain, so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives. Why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard? I won’t say which countries, but you know what other countries do? I will not say which ones.

They put it on a ship. They float it out into the middle of the ocean. They find a nice deep spot and they dump it. That’s the end of it. But we would never do that for environmental reasons. We are reversing decades so Yucca mountain… You’re okay, please. Okay. Just relax. Sheldon, do you have somebody at your newspaper back there who can write. Yucca mountain, please. He’ll call up, “Yucca mountain is okay.” That’s the end of that. So Yucca mountain, you’re in great shape. Maybe they can finally report it properly, but we’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth. They stole our wealth. They shipped it overseas and to other countries. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO, the world trade organization. Probably an even worse deal for us than NAFTA, if that’s possible, but under my administration, the great betrayal of America is over. America is no longer for sale. Last month we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement USMCA. See, we played the song YMCA because that’s the only way you’ll remember. Just think of the song YMCA. Think of the song and you’ll remember that USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Nevada. I also took the strongest ever action to confront China’s massive theft of America jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a ground breaking trade agreement. Probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property and boost American exports by a lot. China will be buying $250 billion worth of goods from us now and 50 billion from our farmers. My guys wanted 16, I said, “make it 50.” My guys wanted 16, they got China up to 20. I said, “Nope. Got to make it 50,” and then I said to China, “you got a billion and a half people. What difference does it make?” They said, “you’re right.” 50 billion, I don’t think our farmers can produce that much, but we’re going to soon find out. They’re going to buy very large tractors. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. we are finally putting America first.

Or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Before I came into office, the far left’s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children, including right here in a very big way. The great state of Nevada. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. You know that, you’ve been complaining about it for a long time. It’s one of the reasons you voted for Trump. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, of healthcare, of lots of other things, including education. All paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. Illegal immigration costs Nevada taxpayers, think of it, more than $1.6 billion every year, over $1,500 per household. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild every city, all of these distressed areas in the United States, throughout our country. The money spend, it’s not even thinkable and don’t forget when we say come, like in California the clown, he says, “come, we’ll give you free healthcare.” People that weren’t even thinking about coming. That’s why we have caravans of people that we’re turning back. Mexico’s been great. By the way, they gave us 27,000 soldiers on our border.

But when a governor, nice guy actually, he’s a nice guy. We just got to explain the facts of life. He’s a nice guy. Oh doctor, please. Doctor in the house, please. Medical, please. A doctor. Thank you. Take your time. We’ve got plenty of time. Yeah, take your time please. A lot of these people have been here for three days. It’s a lot. Those front row people are tough. Take your time, doc. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, doctor. That’s true. They get here so… They stand and sit and sometimes days early. In Colorado, they’re there three, four days early. It’s tough. And we work it and make sure that you have everything you want. Number one, we cover the facts and number two, we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time. But things like that happen a lot because after two, three days, it’s not easy and these are strong people. I’m not going to fight any of them, okay?

Now, amazing people. Thank you very much. Under my administration, we’re finally taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of illegal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, lift up our society, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities. Every day, Democrats’ open border policies are harming and killing innocent people. You know what’s happening, you know what’s going on. In this region alone last year, ICE officers, and they’re patriots. They’re strong, tough patriots. If we didn’t have them. They remove thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members a year and plenty of others. Who else is going to do it? ICE officers arrested over 5, 000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape, and even murder. Many murders. In Western Nevada, an illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year. Right here in Las Vegas, three MS13 gang members abducted a man, tied him up with his shoelaces, shot him repeatedly, and hacked him to death with a machete. You know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s right here in your place, in Las Vegas, right here. Tied up and hacked him to death. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals and murderers, and they support deadly sanctuary cities. I say this all the time and I just… How the hell, where are they coming from? I don’t get it right. Seriously, I don’t get it. Sanctuary cities imperil American lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020. And you have some great ones here, Michael. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. And as the wall gets longer, it gets easier and easier. Remember when the Democrats were saying, “you don’t need a wall.” Two things that never change, right? All these computers, they said, “use drones.” Oh great, we’ll fly over with drones. Watch the people pour in by the thousands. That’s great. Use drones. Before I came along, they all wanted a wall. They just didn’t know how to build it. They had no clue. They had the money, they actually gave the money back, but they had no clue. But as soon as I came in and I said, “Wall,” they went against and I made a terrible mistake.

They always say I never admit mistakes. I do, but I’ll admit a mistake now. I should have said, we will never, ever under any circumstances build a wall. They would have given me so much money for a wall, you have no idea. They would’ve forced me to build it. I made a terrible mistake, right? Terrible mistake. If it ever happens again, which it won’t. This wall is one of a kind. They will say, “we will not build a wall,” and they’ll say, “we demand that you build a wall,” and it would have been so easy. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring and we have ended catch and release. A horrible 
We catch them. You know the story. They come over, could be a killer, murderer, rapist. They come over. We can’t do anything. We have to be politically correct. We catch them. We then say, “what’s your address?” They don’t know. They don’t even know their country in many cases. Where do you come from? We don’t know and they mean it, but some are very serious criminals. So, we catch them, we take whatever they can take, which is nothing, and then we had to release them in our country. We can’t bring them back. And then we have a system of judges, thousands of judges all over the place. You got to be like Perry Mason and every illegal that comes in, they have the lawyers. The lawyers meet them, they get paid fees, but we’re breaking the system. No more catch and release, you think that was easy? And the big thing is that 30 foot… And this wall is built exactly to the specifications of border patrol. Totally. And border patrol has seized the largest amount, just recently, of deadly narcotics ever recorded. The largest amount. We’ve deported record numbers of gang members. We’ve done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We are, as I said, building the wall faster than ever. Faster and bigger than anyone thought possible. They can’t believe we’re getting it done. We’ll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year. 500 miles.

Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now. 132 congressional Democrats have now signed up for Bernie Sanders takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans, many of them in this room, of their private coverage. Remember president Obama? Remember, he said, “you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.” 28 times, he lied, so we should impeach him. We’re going to impeach him. We’ll do a belated impeachment. 28 times, “you can keep your doctor,” right? Remember, you could keep your doctor. Unfortunately, when they found out you can’t keep your doctor, he said, “I was just kidding.” Now, we should impeach him. We’ll do a belated impeachment. Fake news, you have it. See, you have to be very careful when you say impeachment because you know what they do? They go back and they write. President Trump said that Obama should be impeached, but he’s not in office and so therefore they can’t impeach. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about because he’s not in office, so therefore they can’t. So, you have to be very careful. That’s why I use the word belated impeachment. Belated, meaning I’m just kidding, okay?

They do it all the time. They had it the other day. I said, “bring back Gone With The Wind,” right? I said a little bit up here, but I said the movie the other day in Colorado, I guess. I said, “Huh, South Korean movie won.” They said, “ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Academy Award is …” A movie made in South Korea, what’s this all about? And I deal with them, they like me. We’re helping them a lot. They’re killing us on trade. They beat us on trade and then they win the Academy Award for a fricking movie.

But we redid that trade deal, but the other day they got me on this one too. I said, “whatever happened to Gone With the Wind, that beautiful movie? Vivian Lee, Clark Gable, right? Whatever happened, bring back Gone With the Wind.” And some of them wrote, “he doesn’t know that that movie was made in 1936.” He says fake news. It is fake news, they’re fakers. But now, anybody sitting there reading this saying, “man, Trump, can’t be that smart. He said bring back Gone With the Wind. That’s an old movie.” Yeah, it’s an old classic. What I say is make great movies, not this computerized garbage. And I was never a fan of Brad Pitt, I will tell you that.

No, I thought he was a stiff. He was a stiff, it’s like a boring guy. All of a sudden he wins the Academy Award, so fitting. Their ratings aren’t so good at the Academy Awards. You know when that stopped? When they started attacking us, their ratings went right down the tubers. I told somebody, the evening newscasts, they’re terrible for conservative people and they’re crooked, they’re absolutely dishonest. I said to one of the big broadcasters, I’m friendly with him. I said, “if you ever did a conservative newscasts, instead of… you got, ABC is terrible. NBC is just absolutely atrocious.” And they do badly. Not a lot of people are watching. They used to, when we had the late, great Walter Cronkite and these legends, right? But ABC is terrible and NBC is terrible and CBS is terrible. They’re all the same. And I said, “your ratings stink. If you would do a newscast that’s conservative, I’d get them a host. I could recommend guys right now, right? I’d get them a host. We’ll call up… Don’t take Sean Hannity away from us. Don’t take our show.

That’s my problem, I don’t want to take away any of our people. You get a Pete Hegseth. You get a Jesse Waters. You get… I could name so many of them, right? And you put them on that broadcast, their ratings would go up five fold but they don’t know that. I don’t know. They’re stupid. Their ratings would go through the roof, but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches than put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times. They would rather have a fail… Seven months ago we had a little skit, and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money, or big parts of it, and have a really horrible market on the basis that we, not me, we could not be elected on November 3rd. This is how crazy-

… on November 3rd. This is how evil, this is how crazy they are. They’ve gone crazy. I guess you call it Trump derangement syndrome. But if they ever did a conservative broadcast, meaning very fair, very honest When I say that, it’s almost like do a fair broadcast. Just a fair broadcast. That thing would be the hottest show. But they don’t realize it. And if they do, they probably wouldn’t do it anyway because they don’t want to go away from what they’re doing, which is crazy because it is, they’re doing very poorly.

While the social and socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your Social Security, they’re putting it at risk, my administration is protecting your Social Security. Remember they said, four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman. I mean, I hate to mention her name. I did it you know, yesterday. I threw all the runs, hates it.

She’s a zero. It’s got zero television personality. Aero AB Stoddard, whoever that is. She said, “Donald Trump lost all of his debates.” I won every debate and maybe, I don’t know maybe one somebody, but I won with tremendous numbers. He says, “You always won.” I’m not sure. We try, I’ll tell you that and we’re winning now.

But this crazy woman who’s got zero going, zero. She said, “Donald Trump lost his debates that he won.” You know, she was talking about how badly Benny Mike did. So she said, “Well, Donald Trump.” No, I won every single debate. I won them against crooked Hillary. I won them in the primaries like 15 or 16 debates. And for some reason, you know, sometimes you do say, it’s not a big deal. Nobody watches it. Nobody cares. Nobody even knows who she is. I just made her famous, right?

She’s nothing. She’s nothing. She’s got no talent, got nothing. She’s probably got a little drive. That’s how she keeps getting on television. Other people don’t have her drive. But you know what? I said, “That’s really unfair.” So I took out the polls, Time magazine, Drudge, good guy, Drudge, Drudge. We took out a lot of different things and we put up the Drudge poll, the Time magazine and many others. And some of them had to be down to like at 91% and they didn’t have many people and I can’t really show up because many of those people are now great friends of mine.

Some of them are great Republican senators. I’m not going to show results, but I’m holding it up just quickly glancing. I call it a glancing blow, but we won the debates and I have this fake news person saying, “Donald Trump did very poorly in the debates.” I want every debate easily. I never did it before. Remember my first question? I said, “Rosie O’Donnell.” That was one of my best answers. Rosie O’Donnell who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody I’ve ever seen and nothing happens to her. Right? And yet ‘jevich violate … He made a little mistake and they want to destroy him. So we pardoned him. We pardoned him.

By the way, he made a mistake. Rosie O’Donnell. That was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but Dinesh, Dinesh, they wanted to put him in jail. I don’t know. I think he might’ve even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable. Rosie O’Donnell. Five times what she did is incredible. Nothing happens. And then she gets on and says, what a bad guy I am. I’m not a bad guy, but it’s really a disgrace. You know, it’s a disgrace. I’m glad they didn’t do anything with it, frankly because you know what to do for something like that. But you know what? We have two sets of justices in this country. It’s no good. It’s no good. It’s no good. You know the thing we’re working on right now? We’re trying to get fairness for a certain person who’s been treated very unfairly.
 A man who had a juror, who was a radical anti-Trump person, and she didn’t say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things. And you know how they caught her. When he was convicted and then a statement was made, she started jumping up and down screaming, ” Yes, yes.” And started telling everybody. They said, “Wait a minute. Wasn’t she just a juror?” The woman was totally biased. How do you do this? So I fight. Look, I fight. A lot of times it’s not worth it, but I got to fight for fairness.
I got to fight for fairness. Got to fight for fairness. It’s a very unfair system. I guess it’s called the swamp. When I said drain the swamp, it was a nice phrase. I never liked the phrase. When I was campaigning, somehow the phrase came up, “Sir, I think we have a phrase, drain the swamp.” I said, “I don’t like it. That’s too hokey.” But one day I was in a big arena, 25,000 people packed before the election and I said, “And we will drain the swamp.” The place went crazy. I said, “Wow, you never know. You never know.”

Frank Sinatra said his best song. I won’t tell you which one because I’ll ruin it for you, but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it, the song that he liked the least, but he said that’s the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know. So I said, “Drain the swamp.” And the people went crazy. I said, “Woah.” I said, “Let’s try that again.” And the next time I did it again and again and again. I only didn’t know how disgusting and dirty the swamp is and a lot of the media is a big part of the swamp.

So my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. We’re defending your right to keep your doctor and your plan. We’re defending that right. You’re going to have that right back. We’re going to cancel that Obamacare if we could win the case and we’re going to give you great healthcare and we’re making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We’re managing it very well. We got rid of the individual mandate, by far the most unpopular thing where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad healthcare, right? We got rid of it.

And it was upheld in the Supreme Court, what we did. Whenever we get sued, everything we do, if we move, if we take 10 steps right or left, we get sued and we’re now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive. We’re going to make healthcare a big part of this campaign.

We’re protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will. That’s why if we are successful, you don’t want the Supreme Court to try and get rid of this, the caucus. It’s a caucus known as Obamacare, but we’re running it much better than they did. Remember when they had, this was the greatest, the $5 billion website, right? 5 billion. It was supposed to cost 5 million. I have a son at home. He’s 13. He’s a genius with computers.

“Hi, dad. What’s up? Dead dad. Get out of here.”

Hey listen. I’m the president of the United States, pal. Don’t talk to your dad. “Dad, Come on dad. Can’t you see I’m playing with my computer?” The guy talks to me and he’s working with his computer. These guys are genius. You know, they grow up with like walking, right? But he’s looking at me. I could have given him their healthcare site. He would have done it for nothing and it would have been better than what they have.

So remember, come on, dad. I’m busy, dad. What do you want? What do you want, dad?
Barron, woah. Wow, he’s going to like that. He’s a good boy. He’s a tall boy. I’ll tell you that. Just turned 13. He’s up there. I’m saying, “Hi Barron. How are you doing?” But they’re great with the computers. They spent 5 billion.

Okay. It was going to cost 50. It was going to cost five. It was going to cost 50. Then it was going to .. What was the final number? Five hundreds. The number that they spent, $5 billion. Right? It still doesn’t work. They spent $5 billion. Right? And they spent $500 million on all of the problems it caused and we’ve really straightened it out, but it’s still lousy healthcare, Obamacare. And it’s really not Obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate, it’s no longer Obamacare but we’re going to terminate it. We’re going to give you your preexisting a hundred per- otherwise I won’t do it. We’re going to give you brand new preexisting and we’re going to have a great healthcare that’s much less expensive.
And we’re fighting to stop surprise medical bill and Barron’s is going to be very happy. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. You know, a man that does this very professionally is great, into the healthcare business and you have to be careful when you say it, but you know it was just a very strong statement.

But he said, “Sir, price transparency in hospitals. Where you can bid it out and you can look at the prices. Right now you can’t see. If you go to a hospital, they won’t even tell you how much it’s going to cost. They operate and then they’ll give you a bill and you’ll say, “Oh my god, I had no idea it could be.” They take blood. We have one person, blood $39. Another place, the exact same thing, $2500. Take blood, a blood test. One is $39 one, is $2500. The same test. Maybe the $39 test is better. Who the hell knows? But it’s crazy. Price transparency and he looks at me. He goes, and he’s a real pro. One of the top in the country. He said, “Sir,” and nobody wanted to do it because it’s a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don’t exactly love it. The hospitals don’t love it, but I got to do what’s right for you. The people, I don’t care, I’m not. I got to do it.
But he looked at me. And this is why I did it. It was one phrase. You know, do you ever do where you’re not going to do something? And then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase. He said, “Sir, price transparency is bigger than healthcare.” I said, “What do you mean by that?” He said, “You will see numbers that far outweigh healthcare, hospitals, doctors.” He said, “You’ll be able to price out everything. You’ll be able to see costs.” He said, “Price transparency.” You know, people you’ve heard about this for 15, 20 years. No president has the guts to do it. Probably means I won’t get campaign contributions from certain people, but I’m not going to get them anyway.

What the hell difference does that make? I don’t want them. I don’t want them. I got to do what’s right. You know, we’re here for a short period of time. Even if it’s a long period, it’s still a short period and we’ve got to do so. Price transparency is a big deal. He said it’s bigger than healthcare. Think of that. Bigger than healthcare. So let’s see what happens. But that’ll kick in. Unfortunately, that kicks in after the election because we’re going through the final stages. We going through a statutory process, unfortunately. So think of it, we’re going to win.

But let’s say the fake news could give me enough phony stories, enough bad stuff that we don’t make it. The new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he won’t even know what the hell it is. And I took the heat. Isn’t that something? But we’re going to win. We got to win for that reason alone.
We’ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. And that was another one. Tremendous political pressure. Think of it. You own Bayer aspirin. You own all these name name brand drugs that are making so much money. And then the guy comes along said, “I want to make 20 forms of aspirin.” They’re exactly the same. Exactly. But they don’t have a big name on it. Exactly as good. I don’t say better. I don’t say worse. They’re exactly the same. You know, people still, they want to go out and buy the name. You know? I do. I do. You know? Because it’s just because we’re stupid. No, it’s true. They’re exactly the same. We’re approving so many of the generic drugs, a record number. Nobody’s ever approved so much. The drug companies hate it.

They hate it. Never happened like what we’re doing. We also took down the trial periods from 12 years down to five or six years. They’d have a new drug. The thing was obsolete by the time it got approved. We’ve passed a really spectacular thing that they’ve been trying to get for 40 some odd years. Right to try. So you don’t have to now go if you get, hopefully nobody in this room has those kind of problems. Right to try.

And so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything. It’s great. If you’re terminally ill. If you’re very, very sick, you’re not going to make it. And you know why they didn’t do it? They wouldn’t approve it because they didn’t want to be sued. And they said, “No, this could be dangerous.” They said, “The people are terminally ill, they’re going to die.

Let them use the experimental drugs. Don’t wait because they have another four or five years before they can come onto the market.” And it turned out we are having such unbelievable results. And you know what else? Some of those drug companies are now like it. That they fought me like crazy because it’s really showing if it works there, it’s really showing that it works. It’s pretty amazing. Right to try.

I hope you don’t have to use it. We’re combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years and I’ve launched [ 01:35:30] and this is really something, brand new initiatives combating kidney disease and combating Alzheimer’s disease. We’ve made a lot of progress. We’ve made a lot of progress, Sheldon and we’re pursuing new advances in the neonatal research to care for America’s youngest patients, our babies, and breaking all records in so doing.

All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb right up until the very moment of birth. This is why in my state of the union address, did you like it?
Good. It’s a different kind of address. You know, we can go lots of different ways, right? Presidential, not presidential. I was presidential. Totally. You’d have about three people standing here, but I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Audience: 01:36:41)
Yeah.
 The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your very, very important second amendment.
The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, which everybody forgot. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every single walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We are wealthy, right? Are we enthusiastic?
You know how many of these I’ve done in the last four days? People say, “Where the hell do you get your energy?” I say, “Well, the truth is I like what I do and if we weren’t getting the results, I wouldn’t like it.” If we weren’t getting the results. If I didn’t see the results, I wouldn’t like it at all. We’re welcoming Americans of all parties and political persuasions to join our incredible movement to make America great again.

We’re a very big party. We are the party of big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.

I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Was never going to happen. We got it done. This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican party and ourselves. You know the Democrats have tried for years. They couldn’t get it done. We got it done. To uphold the rule of law. We are confirmed and this is something they say. Most important thing you can do, judges. I say most important thing is defense. Second is judges.

A record number of 217 federal judges who will interpret the constitution as written. And we have appointed two great new Supreme court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including more than $130 million for Nellis air force base right here. And we just created the sixth branch of the American armed forces, the Space Force, 72 years, 72 years.

The air force was 72 years ago. We just did a branch. It’s a big deal, isn’t it? Think of it. A branch, the army, the air force. Think of it. We did a branch. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Nevada. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020 November 3rd. November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that very beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.”
We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic within nine years in America.

And we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.

And that is under siege in case you haven’t noticed. You know, your second amendment is under siege. Just don’t worry. Long as I’m here, they’re not touching it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for this.

So true. But we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and they are heroes. We love them, of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.
 And we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. From Carson city to Reno to right here in Las Vegas, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our great, beautiful, lovely freedom, freedom, freedom. Freedom.

Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys who tamed the frontier, raised the mighty Hoover dam. That’s a beauty. Transformed the barren desert into a shining oasis, lit up the lights of the Las Vegas strip and help to make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Nevada, the best is yet to come together. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Nevada. Thank you, Las Vegas. We love Las Vegas. Thank you everybody. Thank you.

Wow. Thank you. So where else would you like to be but a Trump rally, right? [ 00:02:58] Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I’m thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I’ve spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that’s true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots.

With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you’re going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he’s been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He’s been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you.

This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it’s our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people.

And tonight we also honor the life and extraordinary, really of a very extraordinary American hero, one of the last known survivors of the attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. He was in the Oval Office just recently, a little while ago, about a year and a half ago and we just want to pay our respects. Okay, you know it is, Donald Stratton. [ 00:00:05:40]. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we’re going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you.

Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people.

This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we’ve rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don’t tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don’t worry about budgets, right? We don’t worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That’s what we’re doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left’s attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we’ve ever had today, just came out.

And I don’t know if anybody watched last night’s debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn’t do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it’s not easy doing what I do, is it? It’s not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn’t do too well. He went way down. It’s all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn’t breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, “Are you accusing me of being dumb?” Who would make a statement like that? Because that’s really what he was doing, but he doesn’t want to say that. No, how about that? “Are you saying I’m dumb?” That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don’t say that. Even if it’s true, you don’t say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn’t treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian’s gotten much better, he’s moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he’s the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, “He’s the greatest since Reagan.” Then he said about six months ago, “He’s better than Reagan.” And then he said a few nights ago, “He’s the greatest we’ve ever had.” I said, “Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?” He said, “That includes them all.” That’s Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you’ve got Hegseth and you’ve got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, “Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It’s all about getting it done.” We’re getting it done. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. No, but Fox says, and I don’t know, it’s different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it’s okay, we’ll win anyway.

No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn’t treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he’s not too good. She said, “I don’t like him.” Nobody likes him. Right now… So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He’s gone and now Neil’s taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn’t like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, “Donald Trump didn’t do well in the debates and he won,” because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, “Wait a minute, I won every debate.” It’s true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I’m just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, “Nobody’s allowed to do that. You can’t do that.” We’re at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story.

So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It’s such fake news. It’s so disgusting. You know what? They’d do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They’d do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I’m gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they’re going to miss us.

I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it’s one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, “What the hell should I run for if they are so great?” But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It’s like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it’s successful again. But when we leave, it’s all of us. We leave together. We’re unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times… Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics.

Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I’m saying this in front of the fake news because if I’m wrong, they’re going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook?

He walked in, but that’s us. He walked in for… We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what’s going on. But he walked in, he’s smart, and he said, “I just want to congratulate you.” Small dinner, a few people. He said, “You’re number one in the world in Facebook.” I said, “That’s nice.” I said, “Who’s number two?” He said, “Prime minister Modi of India.” I said, “Wait a minute, wait a minute. He’s got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.” But we’re never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven’t figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press.

By the way, how bad were the Academy Awards this year? Did you see it? And the winner is a movie from South Korea. What the hell was that all about? We got enough problems with South Korea with trade, on top of it they give them the best movie of the year. Was it good? I don’t know yet. I’m looking for, let’s get Gone with the Wind. Can we get Gone with the Wind back, please? Sunset Boulevard. So many great movies. The winner is from South Korea. I thought it was best foreign film, right? Best foreign movie. No, it was the [ 00:16:25]. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He’s a little wise guy.

Anyway, but we’re doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she’s a real, she’s a Trump hater. You know what she’s worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said… she was trying to… Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He’s another one who’s going, ” Oh I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. Don’t ask me the question, please.” I look at my wife, I said, “Let’s send him a little note. It’s not so easy up there to do what I did, right?” Not so easy.

But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she’s been with everybody. Every year she’s with a different group, but I won’t use her name because it’ll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she’s third rate and she’s on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That’s why. So she said, “Donald Trump didn’t get good ratings. He didn’t do well in the polls.” She said, “He didn’t do well on the debates.” She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she’s crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, “Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?” 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn’t get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening.

I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, “Donald Trump didn’t do well in the debates.” Now remember my answer, Rosie O’Donnell, right? First question I’ve ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I’m the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling… And the people get it. But she said I didn’t do well on the bench. I said, “Really? I won every single debate.” We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here’s one. I don’t want to… I’m a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren’t my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It’s hard to be friends when you’re competing against somebody.
You’re right about that. So here’s Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that’s Time Magazine. All right, that’s Time. They don’t like me. I don’t like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out… I mean, I’ve won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There’s nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we’ve won it, but we should win it every single year, let’s face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don’t go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, “Isn’t that nice?” But a lot of the women out there don’t like it. They don’t like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that.

Okay, here’s Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don’t like much and they don’t like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here’s another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven’t heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here’s the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here’s another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn’t make this up. Here’s another one. This is a different debate. I don’t know. They’re all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here’s another one, CNBC. Well, the market’s been up. They’ve actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don’t care for it too much. Becky’s like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I’m not going to give you the names. I won’t tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I’m not going to talk about, but he hasn’t been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That’s another one. Oh, here’s a nice one. Here’s a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn’t do well in the debate. See, they’re fake news.

Here’s another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here’s another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I’ve got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I’m not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here’s another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it?

So I’m winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here’s the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That’s what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it’s not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I’ve got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, “Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.” No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions.

And here’s the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here’s a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn’t debate well. Now look, I don’t mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn’t do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is.

Okay, let’s get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She’s a third rate journalist. Let’s go. We’re standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn’t move. He didn’t budge. He said it’s a lot of bull. He said it’s a lot of bull. But while they’re doing that stuff and we’re working with a cloud, we’re working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let’s say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news.

Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some… All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don’t like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that’s okay. But they never show the room.

My wife, a great First Lady, she goes… I say, “Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?” “Yeah.” “How did the room look? Was that…” because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, “Darling, how did you do?” I said, “I did great.” I said, “Did you see the arena?” And she said, “No, they never show the arena.” You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won’t tell you about him yet, but he’s a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They’re always showing it’s full. It’s full. These fakers back there, they don’t want people. But I’ll tell you what my wife said, “They don’t show it, but you can’t imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.” Look, they won’t show it. They never show it and we’ve never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one.

What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, “Darling, I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.” He said, “Darling, I’ll walk with you.” The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, “There were two empty seats. Trump didn’t fill up the room.” These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way.

Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it’s loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There’s trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it’s the equipment, it’s very rigid. They can’t turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that’s dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don’t have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren’t fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it’s fake news.

While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with vial hoaxes, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion.

And right now since the election, we go by the election. Don’t forget, a lot of things happened when we won. From the day we won that beautiful November day, the most exciting night in the history of television, including UFC fights, the most exciting night, the biggest ratings in the history of television worldwide. They were watching. I have friends in Paris and London. “What are you doing?” “I’m watching,” 3:00 in the morning, 2:00 in the morning, 5:00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody’s ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, “This is the most exciting event I’ve ever seen.” And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we’ve invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created-

Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that’s very exciting. And we have our great new General. He’s on the … he’s on our … I’ll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you’ve ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force.
 And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it’s going to be located, and I know you want it. We’ll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your … I met … I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn’t say is, they’ll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do … how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don’t do 1156. They’ll do 30, 40. They’ll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I’ll do it.

I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College … think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they’ve done well, if you’re a great athlete, you can’t … we wanted to get them to go, but they didn’t because they didn’t want to serve five years in the military and then they’d go into the NFL or baseball.

So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They’ve been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you’re a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don’t have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn’t that great?
And the Army coach, who’s a great guy … all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can’t do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn’t that great? And we did it. They’ve been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they’re strong people. And they’re shaking, and they’re excited. They’re a little nervous, maybe. They’re meeting the President. They’re a little nervous, and they’re strong. They’ve got big, strong hands, and they’re saying … and I’m saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I’m captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir.

It’s like … and I’m trying to act like it doesn’t hurt. By the end of the day, I’m going like … but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don’t do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that’s great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you’re being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly.
 And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That’s okay, that’s all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay.

But we’ve destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He’s dead. He’s dead. And we just killed the world’s number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever.
He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them … they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn’t working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they’re blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he’s gone, he’s evil, he’s dead, and America is respected again like never before.

But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They’ve gone nuts. That’s why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they’re leaving their party to join our movement. They’re joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don’t believe stories, and don’t believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls.

I got a call two weeks ago. The great state of Texas. They love me and I love them. Remember Beto? Remember? I was born for this. I was born. I said, any guy that says that, they’ve got problems. Well, he had problems. So he’s from Texas. He had a little problem, he came out against oil and gas, the Bible, and guns. Abraham Lincoln couldn’t win Texas if you’re against … think of it. So he’s against religion, he’s against guns, and he’s against oil. Somehow, that doesn’t play. But they had … listen to this one, because this happened four years ago, you remember? Donald Trump is in trouble in Texas. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. And then they announce at night, 8:00. The polls have closed … and you know they only announce if you’re very … if you’re really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you.

But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I’ve had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it’s too close to call, where Buttigieg … so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he’s got the cowboy hat … I’d love to wear that hat, I wouldn’t have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn’t need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don’t know if we’d get away with it in Washington, that’s my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He’s a big guy. And he’s interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don’t know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It’s like I said the last time, nobody’s leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We’re leading big. Nobody.

With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it’s November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big … and I can’t say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn’t voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they’re … we’re the elite, just so you … they’re not the elite, we’re the elite. And you know what? They’d show up, they’ve got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk … these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they’ve got 30 pins all over their chest, they’ve got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody’s ever seen anything like it.

Really, it’s a great revolution, and we’re turning this country around. And I’m not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don’t do it, a lot of what we’ve done, and we’re going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we’ve done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can’t undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They’re not going to be able to do it, so we’ve got to win.

And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we’re going to take back the House, we’re going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we’re thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can’t be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He’s great. What he’s doing, by the way, he’s the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You’re taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He’s a big deal in Colorado, right? He’s a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he’s the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air.

And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were … when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you.

And we’re also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there’s a reason. He’s my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man … he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that’s okay. He’s done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That’s not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn’t know he was here. I just said he’s a champion, he’s a winner. He’s been a friend of mine for a long time. He’s a tough cookie. He’s the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they’ve made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That’s why he loves me. They didn’t want … they said, it’s too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I’m the only who said, take it. We’ll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let’s do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it’s called UFC. He’s the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we’re not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He’s now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes.
Dana White: 50:41)
What’s up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I’m not a very political person, I’ll start there, but let me say this. There’s things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don’t hear on t.v. and you don’t hear from other people. Like you said, I’ve known this man for 20 years. We’ve actually become even closer since he’s become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don’t ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him … I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn’t see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he’s friends with. He’s a fighter, he loves this country, he’s doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.
That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you.
 So, I want to bring up a man who’s going to win the election with us. And really, he has been so rock solid. There were stories, will he … because we’re doing great in the state. We’re doing great. And your second amendment, you like the second amendment, it’s. But with Cory and with me, they’re not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it’s … it is under siege. You see what’s happening. But somebody … we fight together, and he’s been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please.
Thank you. That’s beautiful. That’s true of the pipeline. A long time they’ve been trying. We got it right away, and we’ll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don’t worry, if there’s any noise, just let them … they won’t hear us. And he’s got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down.
That was quick. That was quick. She goes home to mom, and mom loves us. You know her mother’s a big supporter. She said, was that you in that big stadium? I’m not liking it. She’s going to have a lot of trouble at home with mom and dad. Together we’re building the world’s most prosperous economy, and what we’ve done in the last three year they said was absolutely impossible to do. We’ve created nearly 180,000 new jobs right here in Colorado, nobody would have thought that, including 25,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs. Remember they said, you can’t do manufacturing jobs anymore. Really? Tell me about it. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over one half a century. The average unemployment rate, this is a beauty, for my administration is the lowest for any United States President in the history of our country. That’s not a bad [ 00:58:54].

The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you’re going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going … and I’m telling you, within a very short period of time, you’re going to see some statistics coming out on … statistics. I’ve got to do it right, otherwise they’ll say, what’s wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what’s wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They’re going to be unbelievable. The best ever.

The veterans’ unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We’ve lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this.

To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It’s been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what’s happened.

We’re supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don’t know that.

Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We’re just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he’s beautiful because he gets it done, and you’re moving it and it’s headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we’re up here and we’re doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It’s true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they’re all made in China and in Germany. Siemans.
And for those of you that want to hear it, when they’re making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they’re making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don’t say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let’s get the hell out of here, and they’re all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they’re all over the place. They’re closed, they’re rotting, they look like hell.

Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado’s economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They’re doing that. Look, you’re going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading.

Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can’t because he can’t debate. He wasn’t meant for the camera, do we agree?
He wasn’t exactly great last night.
No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you’re going to probably … it looks like Bernie, doesn’t it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie’s not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen.
We’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It’s over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state.

Also, something we got that people don’t talk about, if you love your children, you don’t have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it’s great, and if you don’t love your children, don’t worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don’t love them, don’t leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don’t treat you well, give don’t leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took … no, it is true. That’s a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their … people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn’t do it. They’d go out … your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They’d end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they’re good kids, and maybe they’ll never be you. They can’t farm like you and maybe they can’t any maybe they can, maybe they’re better. But you know what? They’d go out and they’d borrow a lot of money and they’d lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax.

And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China’s massive theft of American jobs. What they’ve done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We’re talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn’t pay for it despite the fact that these guys … they like to say they did, we didn’t pay for it, and I’ll tell you what. China-

They like to say they did. We didn’t pay for it. I’ll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that’s great for us and hopefully it’s great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion.

You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I’ve told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he’s done a great job. I said, “Who’s the most? What’s the biggest year?” “$16 billion, sir.” I said, “All right, make it 20.” So they agreed on 20 so now we’re getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We’re getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We’re getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, “What do you have down for the farmers? They’ve been great,” although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it.

But I said, “So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What’s the number?” ” 20 billion, sir.” They’re going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, “Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.” So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, “Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?” “No, no, no, no, no,” and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it.

I don’t think you’re going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don’t want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I’m sorry we can’t produce that much, sir. I said, “Our farmers will find a way. They’ll go out and buy larger tractors and they’ll buy some extra land.” Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I’ve had people say, “Sir, they can’t produce that much.” I said, “Forget it.” They will. Look at them. You’re a farmer. They’ll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you’ll never figure it out. They’ll figure it out long before him. You’ll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I’m not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration.

Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they’re brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that’s MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren’t taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don’t even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don’t want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don’t want to take chances either, but we’ll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn’t use to take them. They said, “We don’t want them back. Oh, okay, we’ll keep them ourselves.” We don’t do that anymore.

In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we’re watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals.

As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We’re getting it done.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we’ve reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, “Where do you live?” They don’t live here. They don’t have an address. “Where do you live? Give us your address.” They don’t have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they’re saying, and we are building the wall. It’s gone up 122 miles as of yesterday.

It’s a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they’re pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it’s Mexico, it’s very rough territory, some of it. It’s partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn’t put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump’s wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It’s true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it’s set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine?

I said what happened in a certain area, and we’re doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we’re doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it’s soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that.

Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It’s horrible what’s happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We’ve deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We’ve done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We’ll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built.

Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie’s healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won’t happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We’re defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, “Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.” Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office.

No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He’s on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let’s impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He’s got the world’s smallest neck. Here’s a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you’re getting ready to sue him, and they say, “Oh no, he’s protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.” That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy.

We’re making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We’re now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they’re better. They’re better. We’re protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We’re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That’s going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost.

We have totally transform veteran’s health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they’re all set. They don’t have to wait for six weeks. He’s agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don’t see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don’t see it because veterans choice, it’s amazing. Our great veterans, here’s a man right here. You’re saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That’s great.

But it’s a lot different under Trump, isn’t it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They’ve been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn’t get them done. I’m good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren’t taking care of our vets. If somebody isn’t doing a good job, you couldn’t fire him. Now you look at him, you say, “Get the hell out of here. You’re fired.”

We passed another thing. For 44 years, they’ve been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don’t need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we’re seeing amazing results. We’re combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America’s youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing.

All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.

The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That’s what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He’s the most presidential guy. I’ve always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I’m not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It’s so easy to be presidential, so easy. It’s so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I’d have? I’d have about three people in the front row.

How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It’s great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you’re in Iowa. You’re an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I’ve never done it. Thank you. I’ve never done it. If I do it, that’s a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It’s great to be in Vermont. Joe, you’re in New Hampshire. Dammit. He’d go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He’s sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he’s really sleeping. But it’s easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It’s got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night.

No, no. It’s so easy. It’s so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We’re representing you. I better do good. If I didn’t do good, you’d dump me so fast. Actually, I don’t think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, “we’re never dumping you.”

Fake news CNN went up to a woman. “What does it take for you to leave the President?” “I’m not leaving him.” There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, “What does it take for you?” Then he goes, “Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they’d stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.” Do you remember? Right? ” Would you stay if he shot somebody?” This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, “Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?” The woman looks, “Well, it depends why he shot him.” Makes sense.

Depends why he shot him. But then they said, “We’re not leaving him. We’re never leaving him.” We’re in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we’re getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He’s a corrupt politician.

Talking about guys, he’ll lie and then the next day get caught. He’ll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he’ll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He’s got no shame. He’s got no shame. He’s a liar. I think he’s a sick person.

Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we’re the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it’s a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.

To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That’s a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they’re 40 years old, if they’re 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that’s a record by a lot. I have the record, but there’s one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It’s a record and we’re going up. We’re going up.

The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That’s right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that’s right. Colorado. He’s a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That’s a big thing. That’s another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch.

I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that’s a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I’m looking at that sucker. I’m saying, “Schriever, right.” Thank you. That’s very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That’s tricky. You don’t like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, “Oh, this guy doesn’t know anything about us.” No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It’s great.

For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I’d like to apologize. We don’t apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We’ll get it finished. We’ll get it finished. They’re bad people. They’re all over the place. They’re bad people.

With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we’ve been doing. I’m going to India next week and we’re talking trade. They’ve been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We’ve got to talk a little business. They’ve been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they’re going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful.

But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, “We will have 10 million people greet you.” Here’s my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn’t get in. It’s going to look like peanuts from now on. I’ll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I’m getting spoiled. He said, “Build a bigger stadium.” That’s good. Colorado, very good. But it’s going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase.

We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They’ve made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn’t start it, but we’re starting it. We’ll have it done within nine years. It’s a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars.

You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That’s a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before.

Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America’s thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All I can say is that the fake news just doesn’t get it, do they? They don’t get it. They just don’t get it. Hello Charleston, and I’m thrilled to be back in the great state of South Carolina with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country. Thank you. It’s a phenomenal crowd, only topped by the number of people outside that didn’t get in. If anybody would like to give up where you’re standing or your seat, please raise your hand. All right. Then let’s begin, right? Thank you all very much though. This is great. No, they don’t get it. Down the road, they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow. They’re trying to get to a hundred, but they’re not going to make it. So I think they’re going to set up a round table. Well, that’s what they do. So people want to go to a rally, they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment. Crazy.

No, it’s crazy. Crazy! It’s a crazy deal. No, the fake news media, they’ve been trying to figure this out for years. They still don’t get it though. They don’t get it. Look at all of those cameras. Look at all of those cameras. That’s a lot of cameras. That’s a lot of cameras, Lindsey and Tim, that’s a lot of… They heard you guys were here. They heard Tim was here and that Lindsey was here and that… And they said, “We’re not going to attend that rally,” but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen, they’re here, great congressmen. But this is an incredible time for our nation. We’re thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the Great American Comeback and that’s what it is. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, factories are returning, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military. Our country is stronger than ever before.
We are stronger, we are better, but while we are building a great future, the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down. They have spent the last three years, and I can even go further than that, three years since the election, but we go before the election, working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy. But with your help, we have exposed the far left’s corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let’s see what happens in the coming months. Let’s watch. Let’s just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, “How’s President Trump doing?” They go, “Oh, not good, not good.” They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We’re doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about, go ahead. Say USA. It’s okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of, that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35,000, that’s a lot of people. It could go to 100,000, it could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t, but think of it. You hear 35 and 40,000 people and we’ve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode. CNN fake news and the camera just went off, the camera. The camera just went off. Turn it back on. Hey, by the way, hold it. Look at this, and honestly, all events are like this. It’s about us. It’s all about us. I wish they’d take the camera, show the arena please. They never do. They never do. They never do it. They never show the arena. You can hear it because when you hear it, that’s not 200 people. That’s not a hundred people. That’s thousands and thousands of people including people outside. You can hear it. They always show my face. See that face? They show my face. I want them to show the arena, not my face, right? How many have you been to? How many rallies have you gone?
Practically every one. Can you believe it? I’m sure your husbands are thrilled, right? They’re thrilled. Where are you going tonight? I’m going to another Trump rally. Cool. Number 114. What do your husbands say about that? This group up here. She said, “We don’t care.” Thank you. Thank you. Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job with what we have to work with. It’s incredible. The Democrats want us to fail so badly. Even if their actions, and you take a look, hurt the people of this country, they’ll hurt the people themselves, their wealth, their everything. They’re willing to hurt our country in order to say bad, even if they know it’s not so. We made an unbelievable deal with Mexico, with Canada, with China, with South Korea, with Japan. And if you put a microphone with these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be, not anymore. Best movie of the year. It’s made in South Korea. What’s that all about? I’m waiting to see the best movie of the year-
And it’s made… He said, “It’s garbage.” Only in South Carolina can you say that. Only in South Carolina. You’re going to get us in trouble. No, I’m just repeating what he said for the fake news. No, but seriously the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings. Do you know why? Because they started attacking us and we don’t believe in it anymore. That’s why. No, but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea. They make enough stuff for us, right? And they’re good. They’re our friends. Take advantage of us, that’s okay. Not so much anymore. We are really, you take a look, magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world. We’re prepared for the absolute worst. You have to be prepared for the worst, but hopefully it will all amount to very little. That’s why I tell you when we have the flu with 35,000 people and this one we have to take it very, very seriously. That’s what we’re doing. We are preparing for the worst.

My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States. We are ready. We are ready. Totally ready. On January 31st, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States. An action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody’s complimenting me saying, “Thank you very much. You were 100% correct.” Could’ve been a whole different story. But I say, so let’s get this right. A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes, and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right? It’s Donald Trump’s fault. No, just things that happened.

But you know what this does show you? Things happen. Whoever thought of this two weeks ago? Who would’ve thought this could be going on four weeks ago? You wouldn’t. But things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it. And my guys that we have the best professionals in the world, the best in the world and we are so ready. At the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We had a quarantine some people. They weren’t happy, they weren’t happy about it. I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy, but after two weeks they got happy. You know who got happy? The people around them got happy. That’s who got happy.

I also created a White House virus task force. It’s a big thing, a virus task force. I requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need. The Democrats said, “That’s terrible. He’s doing the wrong thing. He needs eight and a half billion, not two and a half.” I’ve never had that before. I ask for two and a half, they want to give me eight and a half, so I said, “I’ll take it.” Does that make me a bad… I’ll take it. I’ll take it. I never had that before. I never had it. We want two and a half million. That’s plenty. We demand you take eight and a half. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. We want eight and a half. These people are crazy. We must understand that border security is also health security. And you’ve all seen the wall has gone up like magic. It’s gone up like magic. You think that was an easy one? That was not an easy one. It’s going up great and we’re up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security, water, everything.

This is everything they wanted, 132 miles already. We’ll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime. One of the reasons the numbers are so good. We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country. We have no choice. Whether it’s the virus that we’re talking about or many other public health threats, the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus, you see it. You see it with the coronavirus. You see that. When you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in, it’s not the only thing that comes in through the border. And we’re setting records now at the border. We’re setting records. And now just using this, so important, right? So important. I’m doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the United States. We’ve got phenomenal numbers. No, it’s true. The worst presidential harassment in history.

We had a great event yesterday, an event that was so beautiful, young African American leaders. One of the things I asked them, and I’ve been thinking about this for a long time… And great people, great people. Some of them are here tonight. Do you like the name African American or Black? And they said, “Black!” all at the same time. No, true. I tell you. Because you say, “African American or Black?” And they said almost immediately, “Black.” But we had an incredible group of people and what happened is NBC… It was such a love fest. It was so incredible. It went on for 45 minutes. It was a love fest. It was incredible. NBC turned down… There they are right there. They turned down… Comcast, which owns NBC… Actually NBC, I think, we call it MSDNC, right? MSDNC. But NBC I think is worse than CNN. I actually do. And Comcast, a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image… I’ll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are terrible. They are terrible. They’re a terrible group of people.

And they paid me a fortune for years for the Apprentice. They paid me a fortune. And when I left the show, it was doing great. When I left the show, 14 seasons, think of that, they got a big movie star. I won’t tell you his name. Nobody would know. Actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time. But the show went down the tubes very quickly after they had Trump. But the country in five years from now, of course you want to upset them, five years or nine years or 13 years. Or 18 years! 10 more years. Nah. Oh, they go crazy when you say it. When you say to them five more years, so it’s five, but you then say maybe nine, maybe 13, maybe 17, maybe 21, or not, maybe 21. Let’s do this. Let’s term limit ourselves at 25 years. No more than 25 years. No more. Okay. They’ll pass something in the Senate. Tim, pass it in the Senate with Lindsey, a 25 year term limit please.

No, we’re looking to do a great job. We need that extra five to get everything solidified. It’s like you take a tree and you plant it, it needs some time to grab on, right? And that’s what we need. We’ve got incredible things that we’ve done. We have things we still can do, but we have done actually much, much more than we even promised we’d do. If you think over [ 00:22:07. While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with these vile hoaxes, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border, and lifting up citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We added another 225,000 jobs last month alone. And that makes seven million jobs since our election, seven million. The unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina. You ever hear of that place?

Now Sleepy Joe would say, “The unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio…” No, no. You’re in South Carolina. Joe! Joe, you’re in South Carolina. Come up. You ever see the guy with the note, “No, no, it’s South Carolina! It’s not Ohio.” Okay. Then he goes, “All right, Iowa. Did you say Iowa?” No. No. They did that seven times. If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right? Be the end of the road. They’d say Trump has lost it. They like to say that anyway, I guess though. These people are bad people. Now, Sleepy Joe. Well, he’s running tomorrow. No, but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes, which are unbelievable? Every speech. I actually said the other night, I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns. I said, “That’s a horrible thing. That’s the end of his evening. That’s the end of his political career.” And then after the debate, they’re revealing him and they said, “Joe Biden had a great night last night.” I don’t get it, Tim. The unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2.3%, the lowest rate in your state’s history. The lowest rate in all of America. It’s the lowest rate in all of America. I said to a friend of mine, a Democrat, “How’s the race going tomorrow? Who’s going to win?” And he says, “Mr. President…” No, it’s very interesting. He said something. This guy’s a real political pro too, in all fairness, even though he’s a Democrat. But I said, “Who’s going to win?” He said, “Honestly, sir, it doesn’t matter. You are so far ahead in South Carolina that it’s meaningless.” Meaningless. That’s what they say. And in North Carolina too. In North Carolina.

We’ve destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al Baghdadi is dead. He’s dead! He’s dead! And we recently took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. But as we keep on winning Washington, Democrats keep on losing their minds. They’ve gone crazy. I mean Nervous Nancy, Crying Chuck Schumer, Crying [ 00:25:57], bunch of losers. The good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates. Whether it’s this character that nobody ever heard of him. I’d never heard it. I thought I knew all the wealthy people. This guy Tom, Mr. Impeachment, how did that work out, Tom Hey, he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa, right? Millions. He got less than 1%. He got one third of 1%. I wrote a little note. Did you see it? It said, “Tom, it’s not so easy doing what I did. Is it?” Not so easy. Not so easy.

All you have to do is ask Mini Mike. He’s in there for a fortune. He wished he never started. Mini Mike, he wished he never started. He said, “Well, Trump can do it. I’m going to do it too.” Unfortunately it’s not working out too well. Was that the worst debate performance in history? They had a big audience. Everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what we’re supposed to be doing up here. He turned out to be a total catastrophe. 35 million people, can you believe that? That’s a big audience. Very big. And what a killer. But this guy Steyer, he spends all this money. He’s not that wealthy. He spends all of this money and you shouldn’t waste your vote on him tomorrow. I have to be honest. By the way, are the Republicans allowed to vote anyway even though… Are you ready? You ready? Let’s do it together. I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint, I assume. Lindsey, Tim, our great congressmen, are we allowed to do this? So am I allowed to request… First we-

Congressman, are we allowed to do this? Am I allowed to request … First, we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against President Trump. And then if it’s legal, I always say if it’s permissible by law, because they have so many little booby traps, but they only like getting the Republicans. Democrats skirt, right? But we’ll see what happens about that. The Democrats. But let me ask you this. Lindsey, Tim, you’re pros. These are two of the greatest guys I know. So let me ask you this.

So I don’t know what the record attendance is in this arena, but I was told that we broke it by a lot. And you got the people outside. Are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for? Because you’re allowed to skip. All right, so wait a minute, let’s do a poll. We do this for the fake news back there. Ready? Who would be the best candidate for us? Not for them. We’re ready. Ready? So let’s go through them just quickly. We won’t include Steyer because he’s a loser. He’s out, okay? We won’t include him. Who would be the best? This is a real poll. This isn’t one of those fake polls taken by … In all fairness, I love you, Fox, taken by Fox, the worst pollster. This guy … this pollster hates Trump’s guts. I was losing the last election by a fortune. They said, “He did great with women.” Everything was wrong. And they never replaced this guy. But watch this. You ready?

So first we’ll go … let’s say sleepy Joe, right? Right? Then we’ll go crazy Bernie. Then we’ll go mini Mike. I think he’s out of it. Should we include mini Mike or not? Mini Mike is gone. Mini Mike is gone. I think he’s gone. He doesn’t have a chance. So let’s not talk … and he’s not in your election anyways, so let’s forget. So mini Mike, I hear mini Mike, by the way, has left. He’s basically given up. That’s what I hear. He gave up. He gave up. Now, I hope what I just said keeps him in. You know, he’s the kind of a guy, he’ll stay in because, “I don’t want to be wrong.” Mike, it’s time to go home. Go home, Mike, and enjoy your life. Go home and spend some money on something.

So let’s just go … okay. Do you agree we’ll go for the two … Look, Pocahontas, we can forget about her, right? Pocahontas. I came out with that name far too early because those burning embers they got … [ 00:30:54] horrible to people. They said, “She’s not dumb, but she’s just damn mean. We can’t vote for her.” She’s a mean one. She is mean. So Pocahontas, should we leave her in or out?
How about Klobuchar? Not going to happen. So really we’re down to two candidates, right? Sleepy Joe Biden and crazy Bernie. So this is a poll. I guarantee you this. As much as they hate me, they hate me. They’re going to put this all over the place. We have a poll of like 30,000 people inside and out. They’re doing it outside, too. We have a poll. Are you ready?
Who do I … So in other words, who’s the weaker of the two? I’m not interested in who does better. No, no. I’m not interested … wait. Ready? In other words, who do I want to run against? Meaning … very simple. We put it into nice, simple language. Who the hell is easier to beat? So who is easier for us? Not me. For us to beat. Ready? Crazy Bernie? Or sleepy Joe? I don’t know. I think maybe a crazy Bernie has it a little bit. Once more just quick. Ready?
 He said, “It doesn’t matter, you’ll beat them all.”

I hope so. I hope so. So who is easier to beat, crazy Bernie or sleepy Joe? They think Bernie’s easier to beat. They think Bernie’s easier to beat. So whether it’s Bernie Sanders’ plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Warren’s plan. I told you that I had more Indian blood in me than her, even though I have none. I have none. Zero. I have none. I have none. I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has. And she choked. She said, “I’m going to show. I’m going to show.” She hired this company and they went out and did a blood test. 1,024th, right? So that means I probably one somewhere down the line a million years ago.

I’m telling you, that was horrible. She choked. We don’t want a person to win that chokes. We don’t want to choke artist, right? One thing you will say about me, I’m not a choker. With all these people for years, they’re after me years. We can’t have chokers. We can’t have chokers as your president. So Elizabeth Warren’s plan to eliminate America’s borders. That’s what she would … or mini Mike’s plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns. How about that? Mini Mike wants to take away your guns. The insanity of the Democrat party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great new Republican party. This November, we are going to take back the House. We are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House.

I wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people. Seriously. I wonder what they say. They never talk about it. They’ll say, “Joe Biden had a fabulous crowd today.” Fabulous. So fabulous that there’s like five people. And they’ll leave and they’ll say, “President Trump had a smattering of applause.” Smattering. They use the word smattering a lot. This is not … let’s let them hear it. This is not a … this is a big … this is not a smattering. It’s not a smattering. Turn the cameras. That’s not a smattering. That is not a smattering.

I hate it. They say Donald Trump … In India, I hate to say this to you, but … so they actually have 129,000 seat stadium. Did you see it? The place was packed, and they did better than most. They gave me credit for 100,000. That was not bad. It’s 129. The stadium holds 100. They had a field that’s about three times … it’s cricket. It’s the biggest stadium. And they had 129. I was with the Prime Minister of India, Modi. Great guy, loved by the people of India. And we had an amazing thing. And I went in, and here’s the problem. This is a big crowd. And normally I like talking about my crowds because I get the crowds like nobody, but I just got back from 140 or 50 or 60,000 people and now I’m coming here. What does this place hold, 15? It’s hard to be enthused. You understand that?

I may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India. Think of this, they have 1.5 billion people. We have 350, so we’re doing pretty well, I’ll tell you what, but I love this crowd, and I love that crowd too. Tell you they have a great love for … They have a great love. They have a great leader, and they have a great love for the people of this country. That was really a worthwhile trip. With us tonight are both of your incredible US Senators. Two incredible friends, two warriors. Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, come up here. And by the way, Tim’s incredible mother is right here in the front row. As they’re doing that, they got this big … I was going to almost do a poll on the two of them, but we’re not doing that. But Lindsey is a true fighter for South Carolina. Loves your state. And as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee … you know that, right? He’s the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So important. So important. Senator Graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the Constitution as written. Lindsey was amazing, you remember, for Justice Brett Kavanaugh? Remember how badly he … Great job, Lindsey. Great job, man. Thank you.

Senator Scott is a leading superstar. He’s a superstar. But he is a leader in lowering healthcare costs like nobody has done it. People don’t know, but in the last year, prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years. And that was with no Democrat help. If we had the help, we could lower it by 50%. But we’ll get their help. One of these days, they’re going to get smart. Senator Scott provides world class care for our veterans. What he’s done for our veterans is incredible. And bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through opportunity zones, including 135 right here in South Carolina. That’s what it is. Tim Scott came to my office with an idea. He said, “Opportunity zone.” I said, “Tim, what the hell is that?” What is it? Right, Tim?
And he went through a whole big thing and I said, “This maybe could work,” and we tried it. It is an incredible success, and what he’s done for this country is incredible. It’s incredible. Lindsey. We’ll start with Lindsey. Say a few words, please. Thank you.
Well, that was quite a display, wasn’t it? Now there’s a lot of love in this room. A lot of people say to me, friends of mine, they’ve very successful. They’ll say, “How do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this?” You know why? There’s such love in the room it’s easy. No, it’s true. There is such … I explained, they don’t understand it, because they’re not for doing that, but I say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it’s easy to do. Very easy. Right? It’s sort of easy to do. We’re also thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state. And some of you maybe know I liked this guy for a long time, Governor Henry McMaster. Come up, Henry. Come up, Henry.
 Representatives Joe Wilson, Jeff Duncan, William Timmons, Ralph Norman, Tom Rice, and the Chairman of the South Carolina Republican party, Drew McKissick.
 As I introduce somebody, and I’ll just say stay there because he was brave, but he got hit hard. He’s a very special man, retired Marine Corps, major general, and most of you know he received the Congressional Medal of Honor, James E. Livingston. James, just relax. Where’s James? He got hit hard. Thank you, James. Congressional Medal of Honor winner. Thank you, James.
 They are great brave people. You know, we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and they’re both the highest awards. One civilian, one is military. I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off, I’ll read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honors, many are not living, to be honest with you. And I’ll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill, hit 19 times by gunfire, grabbing four people, bringing them down, getting onto a helicopter, falling out of the helicopter, hitting a tree on the way down. Hitting a tree. They went back and saved him, but he died later. I mean, those are tough deals. Those are tough deals. We have one right here who’s living. We have one right here who’s living. But they are tough. So thank you very much for being here. And maybe I could ask our governor, our great governor of this incredible state, to say a few words. Please, Henry.
Thank you very much. And where’s Alan? Is your son here? You’re great son, Attorney General? Alan, thank you very much. Take good care of him, okay? Thank you. Thank you, Alan. And thanks to Republicans all over America. We are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible. Since my election, over 121,000 new jobs have been created right here in South Carolina. We’ve lifted 10 million people off welfare, including 7 million off of food stamps. And that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. They’re working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they’re making much more money and it costs our country nothing. We make money, they pay taxes. It’s a whole different deal.

Median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country. The unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. How about that one? It’s a good one. That’s a good one. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached record lows. Black youth unemployment has reached an all time low. Black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country.

For decades, Democrat politicians betrayed African-Americans. They forced their children into failing schools. They shipped their jobs to foreign countries. They pushed their unfair sentencing policies. You know about Alice? You know Alice? And they favored illegal aliens over their own constituents. You know that. That’s been happening for a long time. My administration is reversing these failed policies and delivering record gains for African-Americans. We are going to compete for every single vote in 2020, and we expect to win a historic share of the black vote come election day. We are supporting working families by fighting paid … we got something that nobody thought could happen: Paid family leave. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 more in their pocket thanks to the Republican Child Tax Credit. Republican, not Democrat. We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country. For years, politicians sold you out to global special interests, enriching other countries at your expense. That ended. That ended. But I am not the president of the globe. I don’t want to be the president of the world. I am the president of the United States of America.

Last month, we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe, and I signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. The USMCA is a tremendous, giant, beautiful victory for South Carolina farmers, ranchers, manufacturers all across the state. Nothing like it, what you had to go through with NAFTA. Everybody was leaving. It was a disgrace that it was ever signed. You know it better than anybody. You had those empty hopes all over the country, all over this state. All around the world, we are demanding trade that is fair and my all time favorite word: reciprocal. Reciprocal. Got to be fair.

After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. We are finally putting America first. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you, the American taxpayer. They want to treat illegal aliens, people that come into our country illegally, better than they want to treat our military and our veterans. Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it threatens innocent lives. I recently invited to the White House the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped, beaten, brutalized, and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in New York City.

Here in Charleston County, an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade. In Berkeley County, officers captured a previously deported MS-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire. And he should have never been in our country. He shouldn’t have been allowed.
Audience: 54:18)
Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.

It’s being built.
It’s being built.
 
By the way, just in case you haven’t heard, it is being built. That, you know. And they’re going to go nuts. They’re going to go nuts. They thought they got me. They said, “Okay.” Have you heard them recently? “Okay. He’s building the wall.” And you think it’s easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep State and some never-Trumpers? They’re a dying breed though. The good thing, they’re on respirator. They’re on respirator. They’re on mouth to mouth resuscitation. You can do it. I’m not doing it. They’re on mouth to mouth resuscitation, the never-Trumpers. But you think it’s easy. It’s not. But that’s been built. But you know what they say now. “Okay. He’s building the wall, but Mexico’s not paying for it.” Yes they are, actually. They are. They are. They are paying for it.

And some of the fake news knows that, but they refuse to report it, but that’s okay. You’ll see. You’ll see what’s going on. And I want to thank Mexico because, by the way, right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border. We have Mexico protecting our border. And they only do that for Trump. They don’t do that for sleepy Joe. They don’t do that for crazy Bernie. And they don’t do it for mini Mike, that’s for sure. They’re only doing that for Trump, right? 27,000 soldiers protecting our border. In this region …

… thousand soldiers protecting our border. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE … They’ve been treated so badly, right? They are great. They’re brave. They’re tough. Any men? There are tough guys in here, but anybody want to be an ICE officer? It’s tough stuff, right? They go into those nests. They call them nest. That’s where these guys get together and they knock the hell. I mean, if they have to … I have to be very careful. I don’t want to get them in trouble, because the press wants us to be very politically correct. So let me change it around. They go into a nest of MS13, and they say, “Oh, hello gentlemen. How are you?” On occasion, they have a fight. They never lose those fights. We need people like that. “Hello gentleman. How are you? How many people did you kill last year? How many people did you get kill last year with a knife,” because they like knives because it’s more painful. This is the kind of people that we were letting into our country. ICE has taken them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands.

Last year, ICE officers arrested 12,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses, including robbery, rape and many for a thing called murder. On Wednesday we won the big case in federal court. Did you see that? Did you see that? We won the case unanimously. Unanimously. Federal appeals court, where we don’t have to give money to sanctuary cities and States if they don’t work with us, finally. Finally. Finally. Why should we?

Yet the Democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens. They want unfettered catch and release. We have ended that program. It was not easy. We have to go through courts. Everything is a court. Everything is a suit. We do anything. We turn to the right, they sue us. We turn to the left, they sue us. We win. But we’re winning. We have 218 judges now. It’s good. Let me just preface that by saying I know they give fair opinions. It bears no relationship to who appoints them, but I never win with an Obama appointed judge ever. I don’t win. No, we have great judges going onto the courts. Great judges. They’re fair judges. They’re judges that truly love our constitution. It’s great.

They’re judges that if we feel it’s right, they don’t want to invite the world to trespass across our borders. Very simple. The democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violet criminal aliens. You know that. You’ve been reading. All you have to do is pick up a paper every day. They release these horrible criminals to terrorize our communities. We don’t do that anymore. We won’t let it happen, and now we don’t have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they’re going to want. It’s a whole game changer.

They don’t even want to report it. “I don’t know. I didn’t see much.” They keep talking about the virus. “Oh, the virus. Is Trump doing a good job? Oh, I don’t think so. Gee, I don’t think so.” Chucky Schumer: “I don’t think he’s doing a good job.” This guy doesn’t know he’s alive. Oh, what bad people. Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.

Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last spring, and we have ended catch and release permanently. You know what catching release is? We catch them, we grab them. We say, “Could we please have your address?” “Address? I don’t know what the hell is an address?” They don’t have an address. “Could we have a number? Do you have a phone? Could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court.” What they do is they catch him, they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives, and it’s one of those things in many cases, and then release. We release him into our country. We don’t do that anymore. If you knew what it took …

We catch them, and we take some information and we release them in, and we say, “Please report back in four years from now for your trial.” About 2% come back, and they’re the ones that are the dumbest people I’ve ever seen. 2%. Nobody comes back. It’s crazy, but we’re getting a change. It would be so easy. They call it loopholes. Loopholes. That word alone, they call it loopholes. It would be so easy if we had some democrat support. We don’t have any Democrat support. They want open borders. They don’t care about crime. Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year. We have deported record numbers of gang members. We are building the wall faster than ever, and we will soon be rebuilding more than one mile a day.

Washington democrats have never been more extreme. 132 congressional democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders’ healthcare takeover. They want to take away your healthcare. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and to destroy your social security. That’s what’s going to happen. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice. Remember when President Obama would say, “You can keep your doctor. You could keep your plan.” 28 times. He said, “You can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan.” Well, he lied. We should impeach him. We should impeach him for that. He lied 28 times. “You’ll keep your doctor, keep your plan. It’s wonderful. Great.” Went through the roof. We’re doing a great job.

We killed the individual mandate, which is the most unbelievable, horrible. It’s not really Obamacare anymore, but we’re running the hulk of it and we’re trying to kill it entirely, and then we will put it back. You’ll have great health care, and preexisting conditions will be totally protected. Preexisting conditions will be totally protected. We’re making healthcare better and much cheaper. While premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office, we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old Obamacare. Think of that and better. And better.

We are stopping surprise medical billing, a disgrace. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency, because when providers are required to show their prices, which they don’t have to do, but now they do, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. They’re just as good. I always like a name brand. I mean, there’s something. There’s no difference. Probably sometimes they’re better. We’ve totally transformed veteran’s healthcare, getting long ought VA choice and VA accountability passed after 50 years.

Hopefully nobody in this great arena needs it, but we have passed something that they said couldn’t happen: the spectacular right to try. You know what that is? If you’re terminally ill, you go all over the world. If you have no money, you can’t. You go home and you die. You’re terminally ill. They go all over the world. If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe. They’re searching. We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest labs in the world, greatest technicians in the world, and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems. Now, you sign a piece of paper. We’re not going to hold anybody liable. You get to use that drug, and the results have been unbelievable. Unbelievable.

Hopefully you don’t need it, but now we have right to try. They’ve been trying for 51 years to get that approved. 51 years, and we got it approved. I guess I’m good at getting things approved, aren’t I? Those people that I brought up here where the reason too, every one of them. They were incredible. Thank you. Thank you. Senators, Congressman, they were the reasons.

We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 32 years. We have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease, which is a big deal. Kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it’s so much work. They die from overwork. It’s just crazy. In theory, they could keep them going for a long time, but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do. We’ve done things that make it so much easier, and it’s just such an honor to be involved. Also, Alzheimer’s disease, we’re really making strides. It’s really a great thing. Great thing.

we’re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America’s youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and of course the late, great Abraham Lincoln.
 
Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are a big tent. We are a big party. We are the party of big ideas for the future. This is where it is. This is where it is. this is not the old Republican Party. This is a very inclusive party. This is a great party. Republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice, including right here in South Carolina. We want to give school choice to every child in America who needs it, from kindergarten to 12th grade, because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.

I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. That’s a big deal. This could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party. They came to me, a group of people, and they wanted criminal justice reform. I wasn’t sure about the issue, but we had a lot of great Republicans, very much in favor of it, including people that happen to be right here today. They were very much, and I started studying the issue, worked hard on the issue, and criminal justice reform. You saw Alice Johnson come out of prison. 22 years. She had another 20 years left. Think of it. For a phone call. For a phone call. A great woman, but we have many people coming out that shouldn’t be there for anywhere near those terms. Not for those terms.

But they came to see me, a group. A group of people came. Van Jones, he came up. “Oh, thank you, sir.” They needed four senators. They needed help. I called Lindsey, I called everybody. I called Tim, who’s so great on everything. I called everybody. They needed four senators and maybe five, and they needed help with some of the ones that weren’t moving in the right direction. I gave it to them, and I got it, and it was not easy. We get criminal justice reform, and then I signed it. Then this Van Jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all. They say, “Van Jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform.” I called our great first lady over. I said, “Darling, please take a look. It’s going to be so nice, because honestly, look, they couldn’t have done even close without me.” I got all these people together, got them done. It was impossible. Previous presidents couldn’t even think about it. They couldn’t even think about doing it, and they tried, although I don’t think they tried too hard, bur they could have never done it.

So he gets up, and he starts by saying, “I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton. I knew Al when he was very heavy. He looked better when he was heavy. It’s true. He’s one of the few people, he really looked better when he was heavy. He looked much better when he was heavy. I’ve got to tell him. I have to explain, because I know him very well. He would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president, but he can’t admit it on television.” But he called and he said, “I want to take the Reverend Al Sharpton,” and then name after name after name of people that I never heard of. My wife said, “Are they going to think about you, right? Are they going to think about you?” I said, “Darling, of course.” I said, “He’s saving me til the end, because I was by far.” It’s true. This is true, Tim. Lindsay, this is true.

I said, “He’s saving me til the end. It’s going to be such an honor to be recognized, because I don’t get enough publicity. I need a little bit more.” He got to the end and he didn’t say it, and she looked at me. She sort of smiled. I think she loved it in a certain way. But she sort of smiled. She said, “That’s too bad.” I said, “Yeah, it is.” Then he said, “I have one more thing to say. We must get out this year and fight and vote against this President of the United States.” Can you believe that? It’s true? It’s a true story. Van Jones. These are just terrible that they could … I was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady, but I’ll live through it somehow.

I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years. 52 years that Golan Heights had been fighting and fighting for it. I did it, and I did the true capital, Jerusalem, right? How many presidents promise that? Every president for many, many decades promised we’re going to do that. They never did it. I did it. We did a lot. We’ve invested more than $2 trillion in the United States military, including more than $150 million this year in Joint Base Charleston, Fort Jackson, and Paris Island. We created the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the Space Force. We have another branch. 72 years. Not for 72 years, the Air Force, have they done a new branch. We did the Space Force.

When I first said it, everybody thought I was joking. I said, “I’m not joking.” They thought it was from the comic strips or the future movies. I said, “No, it’s all about space.” In a number of years, people are going to say, “I can’t believe we didn’t do this sooner.” We need a little vision. We need a little foresight. You know what? I mentioned Space Force. At arenas like this, it gets one of the biggest hands, because that’s where it’s at. That’s where it’s going, unfortunately, or fortunately. We needed it for defense. We needed it for offense. Sixth branch. 72 years. For years, we watched as your politicians apologize for America.

Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of South Carolina. At stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation. I really believe that it’s the survival. You see these maniacs that we’re dealing with. They want to give away everything. We will end up being Venezuela large scale version. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, to secure, then we must devote everything we have towards a victory in November of 2020, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the swamp. I never thought it was this deep.

Man. I talked about a swamp. You never told me it was this bad, fellas. That swamp is bad. You got dirty cops at the top of the FBI. You got a lot of dirty people, but you also have phenomenal people in the FBI and other places, but we’re draining that swamp. I never knew it was going to be this dirty, and we’re getting a lot of help from a lot of great people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening. Think of it. From poverty to prosperity. Look at some of the stories that you have over there. Look at some of the incredible stories. Look at Tim Scott. Look at that incredible story. No, really. It’s an incredible story. Lindsay will say it.

I give about 99% of the credit to Tim Scott’s mother. I do. I guarantee you, Tim, there was no games, right? There was no games in your household. It was let’s go to work, right? Great mother. Thank you very much. Thank you. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system finally of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, infectious diseases like we’re working on right now, and ending the AIDS epidemic. Nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years, and it should have been started before. We will end the AIDS epidemic. Who would have thought we could have done that?

We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have to land on moon, and then you go to Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag, and we live by the words of our national motto, “In God we trust.”

From Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head to right here in Charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. It’s true. It’s true. True. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day.
Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
You have the best year ever on record, right? Southeast, best year you’ve ever had, right? You have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year you’ve ever had, but some people in South Carolina are getting a little tired, I’m surprised to hear this, of winning. I’ve very surprised to hear this. Some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, “Senator Scott, Senator Lindsay Graham, we’re tired of winning and South Carolina. Can’t do it anymore. It’s too much. It’s too much. We’ve had years where we weren’t winning, and it was okay. We couldn’t get jobs. We took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us. We want you to say, ‘Mr. President, South Carolina is tired of winning. We don’t want to win anymore. We are tired, sick, tired of winning.'”

They’re going to come in and say, “Sir, I hate to tell you, but the people of South Carolina don’t want to win anymore.” I’ll say, “Mr. Senators, let me tell you something. South Carolina does want to win. They want to win more than anybody, and we’re not going to change a thing, because we’re winning like never before. You know what? We’re going to keep it that way. Sorry, senators. Go back to South Carolina, senators.” Go back to South Carolina, because we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of South Carolina, the best is yet to come.

The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come, because together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.
Thank you, South Carolina. Thank you.
",28/2/20
"
I want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. I’m thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we’re having our convention. I guess you heard that, right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we’re going to defeat the radical socialists. We’re going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, we’re going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason.

This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That’s great. That’s great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying, ” Oh, maybe he’s in trouble, maybe the economy … ” They’ll do anything. They’ll do anything. I’m sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don’t think so.

By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I don’t know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don’t think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don’t have the primary, we’ve already won the thing, you know? I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they’ll say, “Horrible language. He used horrible language today.” But we’re doing fantastically.

There’s never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that’s true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And there’s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he’s running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said, ” Hey, he’s running for the Senate.” And today he just said Super Thursday, he’s looking forward to Super Thursday.

Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, it’s promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, it’s the never ending wars in the Middle East. We’re taking our soldiers, we’re bringing them back home. We’re not law enforcement. We’re bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don’t want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country.

Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens

And all of the things that we’ve done, we’ve wiped out the terrorists, we’ve done so much, and you know what? We’re 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you’ve got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They’re not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.

By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn’t have that, so he doesn’t have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around.

They don’t turn, they don’t turn. You notice, they don’t turn. But if there were some kind of trouble in a little corner, anything to make us look bad, that camera would turn like a pretzel. I used to think, you know, modern equipment it can’t turn, but when we would have a protestor, and I must say, I’ll say it out loud, we don’t have too many protesters anymore, do we? [ 00:10:48]. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally?

My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they’re really working hard, and they’re working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They’re going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they’re going to have something that makes you better, and that’s going to actually take place we think even sooner.

So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, we’re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We’re working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we’re working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it’s a problem, we’re working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn’t know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, “What do we lose with the regular flu?” They said, “About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people.” I said, “Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that.”

So I actually told the pharmaceutical companies, “You have to do a little bit better job on that vaccine. Really, have to do a better job on that vaccine.” [ 00:13:28]. Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So we’re working hard on it, and we’re going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, we’re stopping … Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way? All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina.

But just to finish up, so we’ve made a lot of progress, we’ve really done a great job with it. We’re keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We’re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I’m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. We’ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We’re going to safeguard our people, the United States.

The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didn’t know. Nobody knew. They’ve never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we’re going to reduce and the severity of what’s happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible.
And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans.

And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That’s what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani.

While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.

Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, “Super Thursday.” You can’t do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? It would be over, right? I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you can’t, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he’s constantly naming the wrong state. “It’s great to be in the state of Ohio.” No, no, no, I’m sorry, you’re in North Carolina. No, no. Joe! Do you ever see them run up with a sign, “No, no, North Carolina, Joe!” Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it’s a disaster no matter how good you’re doing. We’re in North Carolina! It’s great to be in Idaho! No, you’re in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they’re a little scary.

Did you see [ 00:18:54]? We’re going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, “Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country.” 150 million! That means 50% of our country. That’s a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that? These people would never let me live it down. We can’t make even a little mistake. We can’t make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, it’s headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he’s looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgia’s not in Super Tuesday!
 
So many mistakes! You can’t do that when you’re negotiating with China. Can’t do that when you’re negotiating with these countries, can you? Those mistakes would be very tremendous.

Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy? Can you believe it? Mini Mike. He’s being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it? Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don’t know what’s going on with Fox. But they’re interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history.

Nah, I got to have more. I’d get down real low, but I don’t want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, “Oh,” they all say, “Oh! Do that again where you get down low.” But if I do that again, it’s a copy. It’s a copy! No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though you’re copying yourself. You don’t like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, “That was nice, don’t do it again,” because if it doesn’t work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? Right? We all know. But no, he’s a disaster waiting to happen. He’s a mess.

No matter which Democrat candidate you’re talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what’s happening, right? It’s being rigged against … It’s sad. It’s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they’re doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state we’re going to win, we’re going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that’s why. Don’t care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo.

But they’ve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether it’s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas’s plan … By the way, she’s history. She’s history. I came up with that name far too early, I should’ve just waited. But it didn’t matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, “Wow, I just did it to her.”

But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? They never caught on. In fact, she’ll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesn’t know what to do because you’re not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. She’s the Senator. She’s the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she’s going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see what’s going on over there? Michigan, we’re leading. We’re leading in Wisconsin. We’re leading in Florida. We’re leading-

… Wisconsin, we’re leading in Florida, we’re leading in South Carolina, we’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in New Hampshire. We’re leading in the great state of Florida that was one of the first ones [ 00:24:19] in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election? One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be… oh, that wasn’t so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warren’s here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike’s plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Don’t worry about it, it’s not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesn’t even know where he is, what he’s doing, or what office he’s running for. Actually, I honestly don’t think he knows what office he’s running for. And it doesn’t matter.

Maybe he gets in, because he’s a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But he’s not going to be running it. Other people are going to. They’re going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But they’re going to be super left radical crazies. They’re going to be super left radical crazies, Joe’s going to be in a home. He’ll be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party.

Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.

Turn those. We have the enthusiasm in our party. No, I really mean it. I constantly hear about the enthusiasm. They’re fighting each other, they hate each other, they don’t know what’s going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we’re doing. We know what we’re doing. So we’re thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he’s become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State’s Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey.
Great guy, great gentleman. Now some warriors that really defended us with the impeachment hoax, one of great hoaxes in the history of country, Representative Virginia Foxx, Patrick McHenry, Richard Hudson, Mark Meadows, David Rouzer, Ted Budd. They’re warriors, these guys are unbelievable the way they fight. The last straw, I’ll tell you, I came here and then it probably weren’t scheduled to win, and fake news, CNN and [ 00:30:01] they were all set. They [ 00:30:03]. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn’t even close. They’re great people, and they’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. It’s nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren’t too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael.

I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina. Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy. Two great people, diamond and silk. Right? Diamond and silk. We love them.

Okay, y’all know we about to win another election. I saw Mini Mike on Fox.
You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right? How long is that? Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, “There are these two women on the internet, they’re unbelievable. They’re unbelievable.” I said, “Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time.” She said, the next day she came again. She said, “I saw them again, they’re unbelievable.” I said, “Let me see.” I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you.

Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. You’re doing a great job, I’ll tell you they’re looking, they’re going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job? It doesn’t matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, “What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don’t.” Look if you win, nobody cares what room you’re in. If you lose, nobody cares what room you’re in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that’s it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, I’m out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money.

But I never thought we were going to lose. That’s on of the things they like to spread, “Trump felt that he wasn’t going to win.” Oh yeah, I’m running because I [ 00:10:30], that’s not the deal. I mean it’s always possible that you don’t win, but boy I thought we were going to win and we were getting crowds like this actually, to be honest, I think our crowds now are bigger, stronger, and even more enthusiastic. I really think they’re more enthusiastic than ever before. And then there’s two set we’re eight months away, that’s a long, it’s not even our, in case you haven’t heard, we’ve got it made in the primers. For us, we’re not even really political season and we’re getting crowds like this, we were all over the last couple of weeks. We like to troll. We like to go the night before one of their primers. We do a little trolling, it’s called we do a little trolling. Bernie Sanders was very upset, “Why would he be there?” Why? Because I want to win, I want to keep everybody happy. That’s such a good reason. Honestly, when you’re two months or three months out, we’re getting numbers that are unbelievable. Colorado went, we went to Iowa, every place we’ve gone, New Hampshire. Every place we’ve gone, just came out of South Carolina, you saw that. That was an incredible. Every place that we’ve gone, it’s been amazing. I’d also like to recognize, so important, a woman who’s really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she’ll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don’t like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara? How are we doing? How are we doing in the state, are we doing good?

And we’re doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we’re doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man who’s really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn’t get along, I would not be here. I wouldn’t do this. I think he’s been tremendous. He’s been a tremendous supporter and things that we’ve wanted to do, and fights that we’ve had which were so important, he’s been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he’s been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but he’s going to come up and I’m going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, he’s been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he’s doing great. He’s doing great. I hear he’s way up in the polls, he’s way up in the polls. Thom, say a few words.

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all for being here, thank you for supporting our President, make sure that I come back for another six years, and we get him back for four more years. Let me tell you about this President, I think it’s very important since before this president was ever sworn in and they were trying to impeach him, did he back down? No. When the media goes out, tries to spread false news or fake news, does he back down?
Wow. Hey that’s pretty good, that’s pretty good, Thom. Lot of times we get people up and they just can’t do it. They start breathing bad, they can’t breathe, “Oh help me,” like Bloomberg. Did you see the debate? Huh? She came after him. She’s mean, she’s very mean. She came after him and he started chocking [ 00:41:10] “Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didn’t tell me this was going to happen.” No, that was great Thom. We’re also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. He’s 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George. With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina.

We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that’s happening, that’s happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before. No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and it’s an honor to do it. Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans. It’s called Opportunity Now, you know about it. We’re also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of $2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit. The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, “How did they do that one?”

We’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies and decimated manufacturing in North Carolina, you know all about. It’s probably the number one reason running, and the deals we’re making, the trade deals, are unbelievable. Your state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed, think of that. Weeks ago, we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US [ 00:20:57]. The USMCA is a giant for North Carolina’s incredible farmers and factory workers. And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right? It’s called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there’s no tax to be paid by your children. So they don’t have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it won’t happen. And I always say, I know a lot of parents that don’t love the children very much.

Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children? Please raise your hand. Please raise your hand. Nobody. Nobody, that’s because we’re North Carolina, you love your children. But if you don’t, then it doesn’t matter because if you don’t love your children, don’t leave them a damn thing, but you don’t have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. A lot of people don’t even know that, but that’s a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration.

Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens, on your tax. Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it is threatens innocent lives as just one heartbreaking example, two illegal aliens in Maryland who had been previously charged with attempted murder were released, unaccountably released, and they went on to further a teenage girl beating her with a baseball bat and slashing her with a machete. The entire democratic field supports [ 00:47:15] sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina? Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even mur-

Gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even murder. Got to change it. Your Democrat Governor, Roy Cooper, vetoed a bill that would save North Carolina lives and ban sanctuary cities [ 00:48:18]. What is he thinking? But while your super Liberal Governor is putting your families at risk, your Republican Senator Thom Tillis has introduced a bill allowing American victims to sue sanctuary cities for the horrible pain and [ 00:49:06] suffering they inflict on our people. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. Mexico’s paying for the wall, by the way. We built 127 miles as of today, 127.

Mexico is paying for the wall. The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said I’ve had obstruction like you wouldn’t believe. The entire democratic party. I could get anything. I created Space Force. I could do anything. I could get. Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows. Mark knows this. All of them knows this. If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didn’t want to get it. They didn’t want to do it, but now we got it, and you think that’s easy? Nobody else could have done this. We’re building it. We’re building our hearts away. We’ll soon be building many, many miles a week, but we’re up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper.

I went to Border Patrol, I said, ” What is your wish?” “Well, sir, we’d like it to be steel and concrete.” They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. It’s called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. I said, “What does the word provisor mean?” They didn’t know. All it means is you’re not able to climb over it. It is very tough. I don’t know if you saw. In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. That’s what the no climb is. That’s what the no climb is. It’s a no climb. It’s more money. It’s a little more expensive. Thank you. Who is that? What a voice. Pavarotti.

So, we’re building the wall. It’s going great. So, they said, “All right. He’s building the wall, but Mexico’s not paying for it.” Yes, they are. You’ll see. You’ll see. You understand. Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice. You must vote Republican. You have to. You have to.

Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last [ 00:03:29]. We’ve added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes you’ve ever seen, catch and release. You catch them. You then say, “Where do you live?” They don’t know because look, let’s face it, they don’t know. I understand that. It’s not even to be laughed at. They don’t know. “Where do you live?” I don’t know. Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows? El Salvador. “Where do you live?” Like this guy, he’s a Mexican. You’re about as Mexican as I am. Look at this guy. He’s as Mexican as I am. Look at that hat. Are you Mexican? Are you Mexican? No, you’re not. Are you? He is.

It’s like Elizabeth Warren. She said she was an Indian. I said, “I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, “Oh, this is terrible.” So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. Right? 1024th, right? One thousandths, so I was right. I probably have more in me. What a phony she is. What a phony.

Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders’ healthcare takeover. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. Remember they used to say with me, “I’m going to end it the first day.” Well, you know what, we’re going to soon be four years and all I’ve done is make it stronger. You know that. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. You’re going to have great health. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice.

Remember President Obama? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. 28 times. They said, “Impeach him. You should impeach him.” 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, “You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.” Well, that’s not true. It wasn’t. Impeach him. We’re making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they’re better plans. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare you’ve ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions. Protecting preexisting conditions.

We’re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. You know what that is? Surprise. You get all sorts of surprises. We have people that take a blood test in one place, it’s $26, and in another place it’s $2000. Same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows? Same blood test. It’s wrong. Surprise medical building. Bombed. Out. Billing.

I signed an executive order opposing price transparency that’s going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. Right? It’s a big thing. It’s a big thing. We’ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. We have given them, and there’s a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why.

To care for our amazing veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, and nobody said it could be done. So now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up. What a great thing. It’s called VA Choice. I got it done. They’ve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven’t been able to. Those people over there were a great help. We have passed the spectacular Right to Try. You know what that is? Hopefully nobody in the room needs. Hopefully nobody in the room needs Right to Try. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We’ve launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, and we’re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America’s youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb, right up until the very moment of birth. How about that? That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God.

Then you have the Governor of Virginia. The baby is born. The baby is born and he says, “And then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby.” This is the Governor of Virginia. The Governor of Virginia. He’s a beauty. You remember what he did? He wanted to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him. He got lucky. But the Governor of Virginia wanted to do that. The baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother. The doctor will now talk, and you’ll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives. Did you ever hear of anything like this?

The Democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. So many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and we’re doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it. No parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.

I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Alice Johnson, do we love Alice Johnson? This could not have been done by anyone other than the Republican party.
 
I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our historic investments in the United States military include $200 million to a place that nobody’s heard of in this audience, I’m sure, Fort Bragg. $300 million for Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. More than $500 million for Marine Corps Air Station New River.

Listen to this one. No Democrat’s going to this. They don’t even want to spend money on the military. They don’t like the military. They’re not going to spend money. $1.2 billion for Camp Lejeune. $1.2 billion. Do you think that a guy like sleepy Joe’s going to put, he doesn’t know what it means. I know what I means. We have to have a strong military. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had. When I came in, our military was in sad shape. It was depleted, but we’ve rebuilt it, $2.5 trillion dollars went into our military.

For years you’ve watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina and always will. [ 01:01:01] is the actual survival of an our nation itself. If you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of Americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what they’re securing, they are securing us, they’re securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November, November 3rd to be exact.

Only this way can we save the America we love, and drain the Washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than I ever thought, but we are kicking ass. With your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great Thom Tillis. We will get Thom Tillis. Thom, I don’t think anybody even wants to run against you, Thom, but we’re going to reelect Thom Tillis. Is that right? We’re going to reelect Thom Tillis. If we don’t, I’m going to be so angry at you. I’ll only come back here a few times a year.
 
No, Thom is going to be great. Thom, I think you’re in great shape. I think you’re in great shape. One more hand for Thom Tillis, please. We don’t even know who’s running against him. Nobody wants the run.

We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years. We’ve already started. Who would have thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms.

Your second amendment rights are under siege. Believe me, they’re under siege. We don’t get in, you can forget your second amendment. That’s what I think. I really believe it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust.

From Fayetteville to Wilmington, from Raleigh to Greensboro, from Asheville to Kitty Hawk, to right here in Charlotte, this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women, and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the Earth. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, blazed the trail, sailed the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day.

Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, that’s what’s happening. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Because together, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we have made America great again.

Thank you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you.

Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I’ve been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don’t go, don’t come, don’t do anything. Today it was like, I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we’re doing very well in Oklahoma, that’s the word. That’s the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we’re going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We’re going to stop the radical left. We’re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we’ve done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that’s an all time record. That’s an all time record. I’ve always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we’re going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd.

And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they’re great. They are, they’re great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We’ve spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it’s submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it’s all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where’s my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he’s running, he’s great.

But we’ll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you’re a veteran, for years and years, they’ve wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you’re a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It’s never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that’s how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number.

And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn’t love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn’t get rid of them because they were, let’s say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let’s say, let’s just say. And so you couldn’t get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I’m going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you’re fired, get out, right? Get out.

They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it’s happening. It’s happening, I never knew it was so deep. It’s deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We’re lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I’ve been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I’m old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn’t lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He’s in Iowa and he says it’s good to be in Idaho. No, no, you’re in Iowa. He’s in New Hampshire and he says it’s great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you’re in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn’t happened to me yet. When that happens, there’s nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia.

I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That’s called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you’re going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child’s play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it’s called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody.

Our incredible success in rebuilding America stands in stark contrast to the extremism and destruction and violence of the radical left. We just saw it outside. We just saw it outside, you saw these thugs that came along. These people, call them protesters, isn’t it beautiful, it’s so beautiful. No, they’re so wonderful. They call them the Boston Tea Party. They’re so wonderful. Yeah, they call them … You ever watch fake news, CNN, you ever watch? [ 00:12:16]

How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he’s standing in front of a building saying, “things are very peaceful here.” And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I’ve ever seen. The whole town is burning. It’s like the biggest fire. And he said, “Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it’s great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.” Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, “You got to get … you can’t protect yourselves.” I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem.

And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn’t that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we’re not talking about some little place, we’re talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who’s radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I’d have an offer out, I said, “Anytime you want we’ll come in, we’ll straighten it out in one hour or less.” Now I may be wrong, but it’s probably better for us to just watch that disaster.

I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we’re going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, “Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.” But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don’t complain. They’re incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don’t talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they’re not wearing their mask. You don’t hear their say, as they’re breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, “What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.”

But you don’t hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we … I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don’t ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don’t do it, don’t do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we’re terrible. And what we’ve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. It’s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany’s done a lot. South Korea has done a lot.

They called me, they said, the job you’re doing … Here’s the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don’t know what’s going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man’s 10-years-old. He’s got the sniffles. He’ll recover in about 15 minutes. That’s a case, add him to it. That’s okay. That’s a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he’s very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that’s amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us.

When you see a little kid running around say, “Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?” They don’t even know about this. Let’s open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We’re not conforming, that’s why we’re here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that.

And I heard it for the first time two weeks ago, I said, “Well, that one, I mean, they’re only kidding.” I said, “They’re only, they’re not.” Minneapolis, you what’s going on. They’re not kidding. They got a lot of problems. They’ll have a lot of problems. Hey, it’s 1:00 o’clock in the morning and a very tough, I’ve used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, “I’m sorry, this number’s no longer working.” By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it’s a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you’re sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council’s already passed it. In Seattle, you see what’s going on there, it’s even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They’re crazy.

So if you want to save your, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We’re a great country. You are so lucky I’m president, that’s all I can tell you.

People have come up to me, say, “How do you take it?” I say, “Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?” We deal with a lot of bad people, but we’re winning. And every once in a while, I’ll have one of these days where I’m hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, “Oh, it’s COVID.” It’s this again. By the way, it’s a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, “Kung flu.” I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, “Where do you get the energy?” I say, “I don’t have a choice. I don’t have a choice.” It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might’ve seen it. So last week they called me and they say, “Sir, West Point, West Point, we’re ready.” I said, “Oh, that’s right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.”

You know, they delayed it for six weeks because of COVID. So they delayed it and I went there. 1,106 cadets were graduated and beautiful. Beautiful [ 00:00:24:14]. Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, “Sir, we’re ready to go.” I say, “Let’s go.” This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it’s beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, “Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.” So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don’t know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don’t know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay.
 But they said to me before the speech, “Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there’ll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.” Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it’s like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought.

Helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought. So they fly over and the kids throw the hats in the air, it’s beautiful, it really is. It was a beautiful day and we’re all finished. I was on the stage for hours, hours, sun, I came home, I had a nice tan, meaning I had a nice sunburn. The sun’s [ 00:26:30] like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I’m off by two minutes they’ll say, “He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he’s a liar.” These people are sick, the fake news.

So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, “Thank goodness. Thank you very much.” Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, “Sir, are you ready?” I said, “I’m ready General, where are we going now?” You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it’s sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, ” Sir, we can now leave the stage.” I said, “Great general, let’s go, I’ll follow you,” and he goes like this, “Right here, sir,” and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, “General.” Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They’re incredible, and they do. I said, “General, I’ve got myself a problem, general.” Because I’m wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you’re walking on flat surfaces. It’s not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, “General, I have a problem,” and he didn’t understand that at first. I said, “There’s no way.” He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I’m being baked. I’m being baked like a cake. I said, “General, there’s no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.”

It’s true. So I said, “Is there like something else around?” “Sir, the ramp is ready to go.” “Grab me sir, grab me.” I didn’t really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, “That will be a story too.” So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I’m rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really … It’s an ice skating rink, it’s brutal. So I said, “General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.” Because I can’t fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It’s true, right? “I don’t want that, general.” Now he’s standing there, big strong guy, and he’s got these shoes but they’re loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, “Okay, general, let’s go. I will only grab you if I need you. That’s not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn’t like that. I didn’t like this picture. This picture I’m sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, “General, I’m sorry,” and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn’t want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, “Here was the number one trending story.”

I call my wife, I said, “How good was that speech? I thought it was a …” Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I’m average, but we’re having fun, we’re having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, “How good was it, darling?” She said, “You’re trending number one.” I said to our great first lady, I said, “Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I’m trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.” No no, they don’t even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson’s disease. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true.

They say there is something wrong with our president. I’ll let you know if there’s something wrong, okay? I’ll let you know if there’s something, I’ll tell you what, there’s something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you.

So then my wife said, “Well it wasn’t only the ramp. Did you have water?” I said, “Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn’t want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.” You’re drinking, you’re working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun’s like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That’s why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, “What does it have to do with water?” They said, “You couldn’t lift your hand up to your mouth with water.” I said, “I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what’s the problem?” She said, “Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that’s sort of expensive.” It’s silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don’t want to get water on the tie, and I don’t want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water.

I see we have a little glass of water. Where the hell did this water come from? Where did it come from? I look down at my tie because I’ve done it. I’ve taken water and it spills down onto your tie, doesn’t look good for a long time and frankly, the tie is never the same. So I put it up to my lip and then I say, “[ 00:35:36]”, and they gave me another disease. They gave me another disease. Anyway, that’s a long story, but here’s the story. I have lived with more the ramp than the water but I have lived with the ramp and the water since I left West Point. Not one media group said I made a good speech or I made a great speech, but the kids loved it because they broke their barrier which wasn’t good in terms of COVID but they broke their barrier and they wanted to shake hands, they wanted to … I don’t want to tell anybody, but there were a couple of kids, they put out their hand, I actually shook their hand, okay? I actually shook them. Because they were excited. They were excited. They were with their president. They were excited. The most beautiful young people. Men, women, the most beautiful young people you’ve ever seen. So think of how you feel if you’re me. I go there, how did I do? “Sir, that was a great speech.” You know all my people, “Sir, that was one of your best, that was great.” I said, “That’s great, I agree, it was a good speech. I like that speech.” They don’t mention the speech but they have been going down this ramp [ 00:37:36]. It’s so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They’re bad people. Bad people.

Okay, that’s enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we’re getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn’t have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn’t do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we’re very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I’m a big believer in freedom of speech, but that’s desecration, that’s a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don’t have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist … Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, “Oh, the protesters were lovely.” Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They’d have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they’ve done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they’re wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I’ll help you, I’ll do whatever you want. I’m waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it’ll take less than an hour and it’ll all be over with and you’ll have your city back.

Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he’s not confusing her with his sister? “Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.” That’s what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I’ll make like a speech and I’ll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn’t … It’ll say, “A comment from Joe Biden,” but he didn’t say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they’ll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, “Joe didn’t say that. Joe doesn’t even understand it.”

If Biden is elected, he will surrender your country to these mobsters 100%. Your 401k)s, by the way, look at how we’re doing in the stock market. Just set another record with NASDAQ. NASDAQ. Your 401k)s and money itself will be worthless. Your 401k)s are doing very well unless I don’t want to say … If you were stupid I’d say, “Don’t sell. Don’t sell. It went down.” But we got it back up, and now NASDAQ, think of it. NASDAQ just set a record and I think you’re going to see a lot of records, and next year, if we don’t do anything stupid on November 3, you are going to have the greatest economic year we’ve ever had. That will be next year. If the Democrats gain power, than the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control. Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left, and he’s not radical left. I don’t think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left, but he’s controlled by the radical left, and now he’s really controlled. His campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. They bailed them out, they put up a lot of money to bail them out, the rioters, the looters and they were, they were the arsonists. They’ll say, “Oh, it’s terrible what he says about the people of our nation.” Maybe some of them aren’t even from our nation. The leftists try to do everything they can to stop us. Every hour of every day, including even violence and mayhem, they’ll do anything they can to stop us. Look what happened tonight. Look at what happened tonight. Law enforcement said, “Sir, they can’t be outside. It’s too dangerous.” We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city. The mayor and the governor did a great job, but they were very violent people. Our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side. Because I know our people. I know our people, but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation. What they did tonight, I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One. One thing about Air Force One, we got plenty of televisions. We have televisions in closets. You open up the closet, got a television. We got a lot of televisions. It’s a great plane. Great everything. By the way, we ordered new ones. No president wanted to do it. They thought it was luxurious [ 00:45:44] wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don’t realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? “Sir, would you sign for this plane?” Now it’s actually two planes. “Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?” I said, “How old is the original or the one we have now?” “Sir, it’s 31, 32 years.” I’d see people coming in from foreign lands that can’t compete with us, rich countries but they can’t compete with the … They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, “Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do …”

So the deal was made and it was made for a lot of money. I think it was $5.7 or $5.6 billion. Now in all fairness, it’s two planes and there’s a lot of stuff in those planes I won’t talk to you about. So I told Boeing, the head of Boeing, they said, “Sir, please, we’d like to get started on the planes,” I said, “I do too, but I’m not paying $5.6 billion, and I’m not paying $4.6 billion.” I said, ” It has to have a three on the front of it.” That’s a hell of a lot of money too, but it is a rather complex situation. They said, “No way.” No way. This was before Boeing had problems by the way, but Boeing is coming back. They’re coming back. Greatest company of the world and that’s their big problem. It had a couple of problems that didn’t work out. That was terrible, but the greatest. I think before that, it was the greatest company in the world. It made up a quarter, one quarter of a point, of our GDP. Think how big that is, one company. It was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they’ve gone through hell but you know what? They’re coming back, we’re ready to help them if they need it but they’re coming back in the coming [ 00:47:56]. This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we’re still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we’re going to win. We’re going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, “No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.” Whatever it was, if I’m a little bit off they’ll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, “Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.” I said, “General, can you cancel the contract?” He said, “Yes sir, I’m very proud of it.” “Oh good. Cancel it.” “Okay sir.” “By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?” “Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.” “How much is it, general?” “$250 million.” I said, “What?” “Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.” “You mean if we don’t buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.” That’s not good, right? Look at these two guys, they’re looking.

By the way, that’s like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, “$250 million?” Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I’m off by a little bit, they say, “Oh, he exaggerates.” I look at numbers all day long. That’s what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great … I say, “General. Don’t cancel. Don’t cancel. Just tell them I don’t want the planes. Don’t put anything in writing, don’t put it in writing, general.” “Why sir?” “Because I don’t want to pay 250.” True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he’s great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job.

So here’s what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, “No way, no way, no way.” The next week they say, “No way we’re doing it.” The next week they said, “How about $5 billion?” I said, “No way. No way.” The next week they said, “$4.8.” I said, “Nope. It’s got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don’t you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don’t you understand?” I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, “$4.5 is our best offer.” “Nope. I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it. Come back when you’re ready.” A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion.

That’s a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they’re not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, “Let’s get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they’re delinquent. For many years they’re delinquent. They haven’t been paying what they’re supposed to be paying. They’re paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,” and they say, “Yes, we think by

And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, “No, Angela, please. Don’t say that Angela. It’s true. You know who I’m talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, “Angela, that’s a long time,” this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, “No Angela, that’s not working.” But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, “Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?” Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn’t paid. I said, “What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?” So we’re negotiating let’s see, but in the meantime, we’re reducing our troops.

Remember this, we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we’re supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We’re supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don’t get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We’re ripped off by so many countries and we’re stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don’t want me here. They don’t want me. There are a lot of people that don’t want me. They don’t sell a lot of bombs when we’re not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It’s called the military industrial complex.

When rioting and looting broke out in our nation’s Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, “Get them in.” After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We’re not happy. That’s going to be very expensive for DC. They’re always looking for money. “We need more money. We always need more money.” And then they don’t do the proper job. So it’s not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there.

They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don’t worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn’t like what he said a week ago. I said, “Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody’s even asking?” We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn’t like that. A lot of people that you wouldn’t even think would care that much. I’ve had people that I said, “These are super left liberals and they didn’t like it.”

Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we’re doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody’s coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you’ve ever seen or ever heard.
 
Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they’re not looking to do you much help. ICE, they’re rough guys. they’re great Americans, but they’ll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They’ll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn’t say this, it’s not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody’s swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They’re great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth.

And when I called them animals, I said, “They’re animals.” And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it’s more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, “These are animals.” And Nancy Pelosi said, “These are human beings. They’re not animals.” If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden’s America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that’s true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you’re seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don’t keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden’s record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what’s great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He’s been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden’s supported every globalist attack on the American worker let’s make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry.

Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, “We have to make this deal with South Korea. It’s going to mean 250,000 jobs.” And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China’s entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens.

When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn’t know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn’t say it. And they didn’t cover it. They didn’t cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that’s closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That’s early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID.

When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He’ll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That’s been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world’s top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently… We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn’t like it. You know why he didn’t like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn’t work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it’s a little bit…

Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they’re paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they’re okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time.
Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That’s incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that’s why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I’m going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you’ve ever seen. I’ve already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing.

And almost more incredible, he gave him 1.8 billion in green cash. Beautiful cash. And now they’re not doing so well, are they? They’re not doing so well. Someday, we’re going to get credit for this, someday, but they are waiting. Iran wants to make a deal so badly. But they’re told by Carey and all these other, they shouldn’t the Logan Act, but they’re told Carey and all these people, “Wait, because if Trump loses you’ll own America, you’re going to own it.” They’ll say you own it. So I don’t mind. I told them we can wait, but when I win, you’re going to pay a much higher price than if you made a deal [ 01:07:12].

I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son’s paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They’ll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that’s perfect and they’re not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don’t want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution.

They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you’re sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O’Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won’t have to think back about it too much, because it won’t matter. Hopefully it won’t matter. No, Beto O’Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that’s not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it’s never been before. And that’s after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far.

And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn’t have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it’s a, I don’t know if it’s an equal court, it’s almost like we’re a minority court, right? It’s almost like we’re a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We’ll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you’re the elite. They’re not the elite. You’re the elite.

Somebody two days ago said, “Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.” I said, “Yeah, why do you call them the elite,” I said, “why?” “Well, they’re not elite.” I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we’ll do it one more time. We won’t even toy with them about three or four more times. We won’t. We’ll do it one more time. We’ll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger.

But I’ll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I’ll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I’ll only pick from that list. Biden can’t release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn’t be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don’t understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, “You won, but you have to come back and redo it.” It’s almost like, “Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.” But we’re going to be refiling, but don’t let it get you. Everything’s going to work out really good. Everything’s going to work out good.

It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, “Oh, you’re going to win DACA. You’re going to win DACA. That’s easy. You got to win DACA. That’s easy.” They all said it. And they came back and they said, “We don’t like what you did with your paperwork,” essentially. So we’re re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn’t lose. We’re going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren’t so young anymore, by the way. But we’re going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn’t even know where the hell he is. Let’s face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don’t think that’s going to work out too well, but she’s actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn’t even want to win. She doesn’t want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she’s got no sense, no credentials. She’s got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn’t have a clue. You know it. But she’s in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let’s cancel those brand new Air Force Ones.

Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don’t think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she’s telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we’re going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they’ve had it. They’ve had it.

Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man’s personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he’s never met. And he frankly probably doesn’t want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else’s jobs too by the way. If I didn’t come along, we’re building auto plants, we’re building everything. And there’s never been a comeback like we’re making right now. Never been.

He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn’t wanted to… Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same… Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don’t-

And they don’t want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They’re not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They’ve done a terrible job and they shouldn’t be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn’t happen. It’ll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We’ve all worked too hard. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I’ve done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.

Racial justice begins with Joe Biden’s retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They’re respected by everybody. They do some job, and I’d have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He’s running on November 3rd. I don’t even know. Does he… Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against… There’s no competition that he’s got. I know he’s got James’ support. He’s got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I’d give it to James too, but he’s not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is.
 
Also here is a man who’s respected by so many. He’s a little bit right of the people we’ve been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people.
Thank you, Tom. Great job you’re doing. We’re glad to be joined as well by a man that I’ve gotten to know. He’s done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He’s been here for a little while. He’s done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don’t want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I’ll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they’ve done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible.

David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who’s got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They’re great… They are, they’re warriors. I’ll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we’ll send Jim Inhofe back, and we’ll send all of them. You’ll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they’ve been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much.

So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I’m right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody’s ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we’re doing is we’re doing it again. And it’s going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don’t quite get it. We’re doing record business. It’s happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe.

Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here’s what’s going to happen. Here’s what’s going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn’t stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here’s what’s happening. We’re going up. We’re going up. We’re going up. We’re going to go up. Then we’re going to hit October. We’re going to be up. We’re going to be way up. We’re not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China.

But we’re going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, “Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he’s doing. I don’t believe the fake news anymore.” And you’re not going to want to lose your 401k’s. And you’re not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you’ve accumulated, whether it’s real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it’ll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I’m not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we’re going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we’re going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we’ve ever had, okay?

And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don’t have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don’t have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, “Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don’t think I want to take a chance.” You’re not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it’s the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, “Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.” And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? “Darling, I love you so much. You’ve always been a loser. You’ve always lost money. But now under President Trump, you’re one of the greatest financial minds in our country.” And all you did was keep your stock.

Now, if you think you’re going to run against… Oh, they’re going crazy. They want the stock market to go down. Even if it costs them money, they want the stock market to go down even if it costs them money, and they don’t even know why. You know what, they’re smart and they’re vicious, but they don’t know why. I’m telling you, they don’t know why. What’s wrong with having the strongest military brand new in the world, [ 00:10:44]? What’s wrong with having these great economic numbers? What’s wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let’s go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He’s a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it’s time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work.

I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they’ve never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I’m also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we’re going to do that. It’ll be done very quickly.

We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It’s very popular, but some people it’s like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it’s wrong.

Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It’s a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that’s over 30%. They’re controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats’ push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you’d never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.

A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening, that’s what’s happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they’d see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we’ll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful.

212 mile. That’s a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there’s something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, “Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.” I said, “Thank you very much.”

And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It’s so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That’s happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn’t President, would have never come. We will become the world’s premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That’s already started. We’re bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America’s terrorist enemies.

When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. “Sir, we’ve just taken 100%.” We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it’s damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn’t sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we’ll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, “In God we trust.” We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.

We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.",21/6/20
"
Thank you. Thank you very much. Ah, go ahead, sit down. We’ll be here for a little while. Sit down. Thank you also, Lee Greenwood, thank you to Lee Greenwood. But I’m thrilled to be in Arizona with thousands of patriotic, young Americans who stand up tall for America and refuse to kneel to the radical left. That’s true. That’s true.

There is something going on. You feel it right? You feel the spirit. The other night, a speech I made, on Saturday night, at a very good place. And we had a great evening and the ratings came out you saw that, on television. It was the number one show in Fox history for a Saturday night. Number one. Ratings. For them, it’s all about the ratings. I know that the other folks back there, CNN, and MSDNC I know they’re very happy. They’re very happy to see that Fox said the number one show. This is the number one show in the history of Fox News. That’s pretty good. Saturday night.

Let us also show our appreciation to my good friend. Charlie. I’ll tell you, Charlie is some piece of work. Who is mobilizing a new generation of pro-American student activists. That’s what you are and really smart. And you’ll be up here someday. Somebody in that audience, maybe a few of you. You’re going to be up here. Right here. Who are tough and smart and determined and truly unstoppable. You are. I want to thank also Kimberly and I want to thank my son. Boy, I watched my son. I got here. Wow. I said, “What’s this all about?” He’s good. And the people like him. People like him a lot. To everyone here today and watching live all across our country, Thank you for bravely defending our nation, our values and our great American heroes. You know what’s going on, because you’re on the front lines of a tremendous intellectual struggle for the future of our country. That’s really what you’re talking about. The future of our country. You see what’s happening. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. If we weren’t here, you could forget it. But we’re going to be here and then you’re going to be here and we’re going to keep it going for a long time.

November 3rd is a big day. Get out, get the parents, get the friends, get the husband, get the wife, get everybody. Now, the difference is they get everybody. Even if they’re not registered, if they’re not citizens, if they’re here illegally, they get everybody. That’s one of the little difficulties. And , you go through a whole nation and you see what’s going on and they report zero illegality, check out California, sometime.

No, check out the deal that they signed with Judicial Watch. I think Judicial Watch was 1 million, or 1.5 million people they settled. They agreed that that many people either voted illegally, shouldn’t have been voting, a lot of things. They settled. And Judicial Watch said, “Look, we were so high. What difference did it make? What difference would it make?” No. But they play a very dirty game. You’re fighting against an oppressive left wing ideology that is driven by hate and seeks to purge all dissent. And you understand that. Amazing at that age. You’re young people, generally, a couple of oldsters out there, friends of mine.

The radical left demands absolute conformity from every professor, researcher, reporter, journalist corporation, entertainer, politician, campus speaker, and private citizen. But we have Charlie and we have our people and our people is stronger. Our people are stronger And our people are smarter and we are the elite. We are the elite. If you haven’t noticed, they said it two weeks ago. I was talking to somebody who says, “Well, you know, the elite.” I said, “What are you talking about the elite? Who’s the elite? They’re the elite?” They’re not the elite. You’re the elite.

You’re smarter, you’re better looking, have a better future, you know your way around to better. Believe it or not. There’s only one thing they have. They’re more vicious. They are vicious. They are vicious people. Anyone who dissents from their orthodoxy must be punished, canceled, or banished. That includes from television. You see it. But you will not be silenced. And the bottom line, I get interviewed by people and I’m sitting there the other day in the Oval Office. And I didn’t like the tone. And I said, “It’s really nice because I’m here and you’re not.” The Oval Office.

And I’ve said it before, you’re the courageous warrior standing in the way of what they want to do and their goals and standing up for faith and family, God, country and freedom, freedom. Unbelievable spirit. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. But the radical left, they hate our history. They hate our values and they hate everything we prize as Americans, and we’re right, because our country didn’t grow great with them. It grew great with you and your thought process and your ideology.

The left wing mob is trying to demolish our heritage so they can replace it with a new repressive regime that they alone control. They’re tearing down statues, desecrating monuments, and purging dissenters. It’s not the behavior of a peaceful political movement. It’s the behavior of totalitarians and tyrants and people that don’t love our country. They don’t love our country. The left is not trying to promote justice, or equality, or lift up the downtrodden. They have one goal, the pursuit of their own political power, for whatever reason, but that’s their goal. That really seems to be their goal. Their goal, or their sickness. And if you give power to people that demolish monuments and attack churches and seize city streets, and set fire to buildings, then nothing is sacred and no one is safe. We stopped them last night. Did you see that? Andrew Jackson. And brought some to jail and others are going to jail. The problem we have is states. They’re weak. Many of the governors, many of the mayors, you see what’s going on. And by the way, just so you understand, it’s all liberal Democrat states. Could you imagine if sleepy Joe ever became president, this country would be a mess. They would rip down everything, everything. Sleepy Joe. And he wouldn’t call the shots. He would have nothing to do with him. “Lock him in the Oval Office. Let’s just do what we want to do.” And today he’s with Obama, President Obama. It only took him, how long, a year and a half to endorse him? What did it take, a year and a half to endorse him? Even after he won, he didn’t endorse him for a long time.

Then he’s fighting. He’s fighting for sleepy Joe. He really feels strongly about it, so strongly that he was fighting. He wanted everybody to win, but Joe. Joe won. But if you remember in my campaign, he fought harder than crooked Hillary. President Obama fought me harder. He said, “You cannot let him win. You cannot this…” He was all over the place. I said, “This guy’s spending all of his time campaigning against me.” Who won? That’s right. And don’t forget. Don’t forget. I’m only here because of him and Biden. I’m only here because of them, because if they did a good job, we wouldn’t have been here. There would have been no reason. I’m only here because of President Obama and the job he did and sleepy Joe Biden and the job that he didn’t do other than he did a good job for his son. He did a good job for son.

No, but I’m only here because of them. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here. People were very unhappy. The fake news doesn’t report it. They were very unhappy. There was tremendous dissent, tremendous anger. A lot of people in this audience, I can tell you. But we’re here today to declare that we will never cave to the left wing and the left wing intolerance. We will never. We will never surrender to mob violence. And we will uphold American freedom, equality, and justice for every citizen of every background, very strong. That’s who we are. That is what we believe. And that is why we must prevail on November 3rd. We have to prevail, get out there. We’re honored to be joined by a great gentleman, a great governor of this state. He won by a lot of votes. And I said to him, “Governor, how am I doing?” He said, “You’re doing really well.” I said, “Good.” Because he knows better than anybody, he really has done a tremendous job as governor. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. Where is Doug? Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And somebody who we need to keep in the Senate. A woman who works very hard. I just got back from something you like, the border wall. Martha McSally. Thank you, Martha. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Martha. We got to get her in. And Mark Kelly, who she’s running against is very weak on China and lots of other things. If between Biden and Kelly and these people they get in, China will own this country and they don’t own us at all.

We have done great. Before the plague set in, before the plague came over. It came over. We were doing the greatest, we had the greatest economy we ever had, the greatest job numbers we ever had, the greatest of everything. There wasn’t a thing where we weren’t number one. We were beating them and they were having a tough year. 67. It was one of the worst years they had in 67 years and we were doing great. And then they said, “there’s a plague coming over from China. Here it comes.” What a disgrace. What a disgrace. And now you saw last week, the jobs numbers, the biggest ever. You saw the retail sales numbers, the biggest ever. Number one. And we’re going to have a very good third quarter. And interestingly, we’re going to have a good third quarter. And right when those numbers are announced, you have your election, so that’s hopefully a sign from up there. But I think we’re going to do very well.

And they are trying to do their best to keep the country shut down and closed, because they’d love those numbers not to be good. But there’s not a lot they’re going to be able to do about it. Not a lot. But we want to get Martha in, and I want to thank Martha for being here. Governor, I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank you for being such a great friend too, thank you.

And we also have some of your warriors, great representatives. And they fought with me on the impeachment hoax. One of the great hoaxes, based on a telephone conversation. That was perfect. I’m the only one that got impeached in history. Hopefully will be the only one that got impeached over a perfect telephone call. Perfect, perfect. This was the perfect call. I said, “Wait a minute.” I said, “We don’t need lawyers. Just keep reading.” Thank goodness we had it transcribed. It was very good that we had it… Because you remember Adam Schiff got up and he met up a phony story. He made up a phony story. That’s what they’re all about. I said it before. They’re vicious.

Paul Gosar. Stand up, Paul. Where’s Paul? Paul, stand up. Paul. Great guy. There’s a man, I spoke to him this morning, Andy Biggs. Andy. Great guy. Thank you, Andy. Freedom Caucus. Now that Mark Meadows is our great chief, he’s our chief. Mark Meadows. By the way, Mark Meadows is here too. Let’s have it for Mark Meadows. Where’s Mark? Mark Meadows. But Andy took over and the Freedom Caucus is doing great. Thank you. Thank you, Andy.

Somebody I got to know very well during the hoax. Debbie Lesko. She’s great. Actually another one. Oh, there she is. She just stood out on television. It was like she popped. She did great. I said, “You’re so lucky you know me, Debbie”, because she really was one of the people, she stood out. Thank you, Deb. Thank you.

Another warrior, David Schweikert. David. Thank you. Thank you, David. Thank you. And a man who’s very understated. He just gets it done behind the scenes, never likes to go on television. Never likes talking a lot, but he’s a great Congressman from one of my favorite states, Florida, Matt Gaetz. Matt Gaetz. He keeps it low-key and simple. No, actually he keeps it up and not simple, but he’s great. And he does a fantastic job. Thank you Matt.

Along with a lot of great people, Arizona Treasurer, Kimberly Yee. Kimberly, thank you. House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Rusty. Rusty. Thank you rusty. Thank you, Senate President, wow, that’s a big deal. Karen Fann. Thank you. Madam President, how am I doing in Arizona? Okay? She says, “Yes.” She knows. She knows. And Navajo Nation Vice President, Myron Lizer, thank you. I also want to recognize a truly courageous woman. Angel Mom, is a friend of mine too, by the way, one of the first people I met when I announced that I was going to run.

What she has gone through with illegal immigration, nobody will ever go through. Hopefully nobody ever has to go through. Unfortunately, people will have to do it. But she is one of the first people I met. And she lost a magnificent child to an illegal immigrant. And it’s just a horrible thing. And she’s spent her life. She’s spent the last long period of years fighting and fighting and fighting. And people have gotten to respect her greatly, Mary Ann Mendoza, wherever you might be. Lots of guts. She’s got a lot of guts. And thank you, a very special thank you to Pastor Luke Barnett and the Dream City Church for hosting us. Where is the pastor? Is that the pastor? You’re good looking. Where’s the pastor? I want to see this guy. Oh, he’s good.

I’ll be here. I’ll get here someday. I’ll be here some Sunday morning. Thank you. Thank you. Great job pastor. I hear great things. Thank you very much. We’re also joined by a man who became such a superstar overnight. I put him there as a little bit of a filler, to be honest, he did a great job. He was the ambassador to Germany. And he was like, I needed somebody to sit warm out a chair. He wore out a chair. He didn’t warm it. He wore it out. Matt Gaetz, he wore out the chair. Richard Grenell. What a guy. Where’s Matt? No. Say hello. You are fantastic. I want a picture of him walking into the DOJ with a big satchel. And I realized what [ 00:21:42] said. He goes to the store, and he’s walking. And he had lots of gold in those satchels. Didn’t he have?

Because I’ll tell ya. We caught him. Let’s see what happens. But we caught him. Right? We caught him. And a friend of mine that did a great job as the NASA CFO. And you see we’ve totally rebuilt NASA. We’re sending rockets up now for the first time in many years, Jeff DeWit, Jeff DeWit. Jeff, hi. Thank you, Jeff.

Everyone in this room is bound together by a shared set of moral principles and enduring truths. We believe the United States of America is the greatest and most righteous nation that has ever existed, going to keep it that way. We believe that every citizen has the fundamental right to think, to speak, to live and pray, according to their own conscious. We believe that the beloved heroes of American history should not be torn down by militant mobs, but held up as an example to the world. Now, they’re after George Washington. I said, “What did he do wrong? George Washington?” Thomas Jefferson. We stopped him. They were heading toward the Jefferson Memorial. They couldn’t care less. I think half of them don’t even know who Thomas Jefferson is. How about Ulysses S. Grant? They want the Confederate soldiers, but all of a sudden they go after Grant. But he’s the one that defeated the Confederate soldiers. What’s that all about? How about Gandhi? How about Churchill. You know Churchill, because this is going outside of our country. No, we’ll stop it. Don’t worry. Just don’t worry about it. 10 years is a long to spend in prison.
 
Our heroes are not a source of shame. They are an example and something that you can all look up to. A true example of greatness, a point of pride. And we will honor them and cherish them forever. We will cherish them and we have to cherish our past. We have to cherish good, or bad. We have to understand our past. We have to understand our history, because if we don’t know our history, it could all happen again. We have to know our history. We believe in law and order, we support the men and women of law enforcement. And we stand with the citizens in every city and every community and every part of our country, who wish to live in safety, security, dignity, and peace. And we know that American patriots don’t bow down to foreign powers. We don’t back down from left wing bullies, and the only…

From left wing bullies, and the only authority we worship is our God. These are the values our country was built upon, these are the values that unite our citizens, and these are the values that powered our civilization to its towering Heights, lifting billions from poverty, healing disease, curing illness, and reaching new summits of scientific endeavor, artistic triumph, and human achievement. Guided by these timeless convictions, my administration has been delivering historic gains for the American people, like no one has ever done in the first three and a half years of a presidency, not even close, it’s not even close.

By the end of my first term, we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved. 300. If you get 10, it’s a lot. 300. An all time record, and very importantly, we confirm two great Supreme Court justices. And we have to win because obviously we need more justices on the Supreme Court. People don’t realize how important that is. I’ve always heard it’s the most important thing you can do. I always said defense, but that’s right there. Supreme court justices and judges, and we are setting records.

We’ve spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the awesome power of the United States military. And I very proudly created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force. Big deal, that’s a big deal. You think it’s just that? If you did just that, that’s like, “That’s a good presidency.” Think of that. That’s one of many, many things, we’ll go over a few of them, but many, many things. So the Air Force was the last one. That was 75 years ago. The Air Force, 75 years ago, we just created another branch. We’re going to have a general, a nice general. We have right now on the joint chiefs of staff a full deal, and that’s a great honor because space is going to be very important.

At first, they smiled when I came up with the idea. I never talked about it in the campaign. I don’t think I ever mentioned it once. It’s just an idea that I learned as I was going through military and a really an amazing thing. Space is going to be so important, that will be one of our most important of all. And it’s an honor. We’re now doing a hydrosonic. I call it Super Dupers missile. It goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile right now. 17.
 
We pass VA choice, a big deal. And VA accountability, a big deal. They’ve been trying for 50 years, almost 50 years on boat, accountability. They couldn’t fire people that treated our vets badly. Now we can say you’re fired. Oh, by the way, you had a big deal. That’s right. That’s right, you had a big deal in Arizona. I’ve been reading about it for years now. Doug, where they had somebody stealing in the VA, and they caught them cold, like 500,000. That’s a lot. They stole 500,000. They couldn’t fire them. They couldn’t fire them. So between the unions, and civil service, and all of the things, they couldn’t fire them. But we made it so that you can now say, “You’re fired. Get out.” And they’ll give our veterans the care they so richly deserve.

Choice is so big, instead of waiting for a week, two weeks, five weeks, you have no idea how bad it was. If they have to wait, and they have great doctors, we have great doctors in the VA. If you have to wait, if for any reason there’s a delay, you go outside, you get a doctor, you get fixed up, we pay the bill. And it sounds expensive. It’s cheap. We saved money. Most important, we save lives. People would get online, and they’re okay, not feeling well. By the time they see a doctor, in some cases they are terminally ill, it would take weeks and weeks, and now we have VA choice, that’s why you see good stories, 91% approval rating. 91% approval rating. VA choice. Nobody thought we were going to get that one done.

We passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms. And we passed the largest number of regulation cuts by a factor of many times, no other administration, even though in some cases, eight years, and in one case more, nobody has cut regulation like we’ve got regulation, not even close. And it’s one of the reasons we did so well before the plague, and we’re doing so well after the plague. It’s going away. We eliminated Obamacare’s unfair individual mandate, which punished young Americans like you for the privilege of not buying bad health insurance. That’s really what it was. You had the privilege of not buying, and you had to pay for it. Not too good. So we got rid of it. That was a big deal. That was one of the most unpopular things anywhere, on any subject.

We will always protect people with preexisting conditions, and you have Martha’s pledge that she is going to do that also. So we’re going to do that. And the Democrats can’t make that pledge because they’re going to raise your taxes like crazy. I never heard, all my life, I think Doug can maybe explain it, but Doug, all my life I’d watch, and the best politicians, they want to cut taxes, not raise taxes. All of a sudden we’re in an age where things are very different, let’s face it, ripping down statues. One of the things is the Democrats want to raise your taxes to a level that nobody can even believe. And it won’t be nearly enough to pay for what they want to do. You talk about bad healthcare. It’s just going to be a disaster. But they want to raise everybody’s Texas. I always thought it was supposed to be the other way. But let’s see how they do on November 3rd, I don’t think they going to do to well.

We passed Right To Try to give critically ill patients access to life saving cures, so they don’t have to travel all around the world and see if they can find, and we’ve had tremendous success with that. Right To Try. Very proud of it. They’ve been trying to get that one done for 40 years. And I’ve just come from the Arizona border, Yuma, where we marked the completion of over 220 miles, a brand new, beautiful border wall. You know, you don’t hear about that, they don’t want to talk about the wall anymore, do you notice. Never has the Democrat Party fought so hard against something. And do you notice they never talk about the wall, because in the end they gave it up. They give up. We won. We’re building fully funded.

I could build numerous walls with all the money I have. Fully funded. But you know why they don’t talk about it? Because it’s a bad subject. Remember they used to say, it’s obsolete. “We want drones.” Oh great, the drones flying around. We’re going to watch everyone pour into our country with a drone. Remember they said the wall’s obsolete. And I said today, nobody heard it. I thought it was sort of… I think I said it, but I’m sure people have said it over the years. You’re in an industry, and in many cases, you have a computer, in about two weeks it’s old, it’s obsolete. In technology, I said to some of the people, I meet them all, I say, “The problem with your business, it gets obsolete quick.”

Two things that will never be obsolete, a wheel and a wall. Never. And they said that wall is obsolete, with modern technology. No, no modern technology is like let’s watch everybody pour in. Now we have a wall. So we’ve built 220 miles. We’re going to have a… And it’s every single element, I met with border patrol who are fantastic, by the way, every single element they wanted, you have to see through which makes sense. You have to do all of the different… We have cameras on it. We have sensors on it. It is just 20, 30 feet high. It’s very hard. We have anti-climb provision on the top. We have the whole deal. And it’s very powerful. And by the way, where that wall is, nobody’s getting through. Nobody gets through. We put a chunk… California, off the record, California was saying, “Please, can we have the wall?” This is California. They didn’t want the wall, they didn’t want the wall. But they wanted the wall, because right next to San Diego is a wonderful town in Mexico. You know the town, I won’t mention the name, but they’re heavily infected with COVID… Did you ever notice notice…. I said the other night, did anybody see my speech the other night on Saturday night? But I said the other night, there’s never been anything where they have so many names. I could give you 19 or 20 names for that. It’s got all different names, Wuhan. Kawuhan was catching on. Coronavirus. Kung flu. COVID-19. I said what’s the 19, COVID-19, some people can’t explain what the 19, give me… COVID-19, I said, “That’s an odd name.” I could give you many, many names. Some people call it the Chinese flu, the China flu. They call it the China, as opposed to the China.

I never said anything like it, but here’s the story. We are going to be stronger than ever before, and going to be soon. I think you’ll remember… Now Biden was going around like he’s a tough guy. He doesn’t know where the hell he is. Where? Where are you Joe? Joe, where are you Joe? Tell me where you are, Joe. But he’s going around, I stood up for China. No, his son walked out with 1.5 billion to manage, and what he did… Where’s Hunter? Remember? I said, “Where’s Hunter?” They came out with this t-shirt and some guy made a fortune, Where’s Hunter. By the way, Where is Hunter? He did well as Vice President, could you imagine how Hunter’s going to do if this guy ever won, and the father could honestly say, “I have no idea what’s going on.” He could raise his hand.

Is that Kayleigh? Where’s Kayleigh? Where’s Mc Kayleigh? What a job she’s done, our press secretary. Everyone’s doing well, our press secretary, [ 00:38:20] press secretary. I mean, Sarah is going to be the governor of Arkansas pretty soon, I hope. Sean’s got his own show, and this one here, she could run whatever the hell she wanted, but I said, “Don’t run. Don’t run, just stay here. We like the job do.” Now we’re doing great.

I stood up to China like no other administration in history. For decades they’ve ripped us off. They ripped us off like nobody. And I charged them a little thing called the massive tariffs. We took in billions and billions of dollars. They devalued their currency, and they like to say our people paid. No, no, our people didn’t pay. They devalued their currency in order to pay it, and they also put money out, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to sell that product. But what happened for many years, there’s nobody ever that ripped off the United States like China. Nobody. So now we did a deal, but you know, the ink wasn’t dry when the plague flew in. The ink, wasn’t dry. The deal was great. Everybody was happy. I was thrilled. $250 billion worth of purchases over a short period of time. All grate. But the ink wasn’t dry, and we got hit by the plague. So I’m not too happy about that. But the long slow surrender is over because today and every day we are putting now America first. America comes from.

We sparked a revolution in domestic energy production, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on planet earth. America, as of a couple of years ago is no longer energy dependent, we are now energy dominant. And because our energy use went down so much during this pandemic, it was a very, very bad period of time because we have 10 million jobs, energy jobs, and now we have the oil price up, where it should be, and yet people are paying very little for gasoline. That’s like the perfect thing. That’s the perfect thing to do.

And I signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform, which nobody was able to get done. Very important. Very important. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. Nobody knows that. And we created opportunities zones along with Tim Scott, and since then, countless jobs in $100 billion of new investment have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods in the country, 9,000. Opportunity Zones. So think of it. I did criminal justice reform. We did a lot of work on prison or prison reform. We did opportunity zones. Think of this. Think of all we’ve done, and we’ve taken care of the black colleges and universities, and nobody talks about it, but I have to talk about it. And you know what? Our black communities know it. And I think you’re going to see something really great happened because they understand it. They really understand it.

And I’ll tell you what, whether it’s any community you talk about, but if you take a look at those numbers from pre-virus, but you take a look at them in a year from now, you watch. And you’re 401s right now, your 401k’s, I don’t think you want to have somebody else playing with them because you’re just about at a record high, and you put the wrong person in, they will be obliterated. They will be obliterated. So we’re fighting for school choice because we know that access to education is a civil rights. School choice. Could you ever see two parties so diametrically opposed to each other? Who can be opposed to that, but it’s so important, but the Democrats will never, ever allow that to happen.

Last month we returned American astronauts to space aboard American rockets for the first time in nearly a decade. And the United States will be the first nation to plant our beautiful American flag on planet Mars. And we destroyed 100% of the ISIS territorial caliphate, and the Savage terrorist monsters Al-Baghdadi and Kasseem Salamoni, they are both dead. A hundred percent. A hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate. When I took over that caliphate was gone like this. It was a mess, but we destroyed it.

No administration has accomplished more in just three and a half years. It is. I could go after…. Those are just a few points. I could talk for an hour and a half, just reading the points off. You know that. Yet as you know, in recent months, America has face down that unseen enemy. The virus from the distant land, that spread across the globe, and invaded our shores, but invaded the shores of, think of it, 188 nations. I have a friend he’s a very smart guy. He said, “I didn’t know there were that many nations.” I said, “Actually go over 200.” But 188 nations that we know of.
I love you too. Thank you darling. Thank you. And tomorrow the fake news will be said, “He said he loved somebody, he said he loved somebody.” Terrible. I’ll be in big trouble with the fake news. They are terrible people. Who are the people that stood up. I just want to see. Stand up please. Who said I love you? Whoa. Sit down fast, please. Don’t let them see you. That’s a lot of press back there. Look at that. That’s the problem, they cover all these speeches. I never have a speech done. I never have a speech where not like live television. Sometimes you’ll have one where you can actually speak and you don’t have to worry about like one little slip, one tiny little slip, one word. You can say 10 speeches, one little word, they’ll say, ” He’s lost it.” No. You know who’s lost it? Sleepy Joe has lost.
 In response, we took swift and early action to ban travel from China, very, very early. Remember Nancy Pelosi and that crazy group. Nancy Pelosi, she wanted to dance in the streets of Chinatown and San Francisco, long after I ban China from coming here. We saved tens of thousands of lives with that early decision. And then we made an early decision on Europe. Yet liberal lawmakers and Democrat politicians condemned this policy to left rejected science in favor of their fanatical devotion to open borders. They want open borders, not just our Southern border. This is why the left is so dangerous. They always put their ideology before your safety. It’s crazy what’s going on. Defund and abolish the police. How’s that a good idea?

I passed a set, I was in the white house and there was this set, and it had them, think of it, defund and abolish. I said, “What are they going to defund?” No, I said, it says, Defund and abolish. I said, “What are they going to defund and abolish?” I thought it was going to be something. They said the police. I said, “Oh great. I just won the election. That’s great.” So in addition to issuing a series of aggressive travel bans, my administration launched the greatest national mobilization since World War II, we have done such a great job with this, between the ventilators and all of these things, including testing. We’re testing so much. We’re now up to 27.5 million tests. I thought it was 25, because it seemed like 25 million. 27, they just told me, 27.5 million tests. Now, when you have all those tests, you have more cases. So the news covers it, “They have more cases.” Well, yeah, if you’re going to do 20, and if let’s say other countries do 1 million, 2 million, big countries, 3 million.

Now four weeks ago, Germany was at 3 million tests. So I don’t know what they are now, but I know they’re not anywhere near where we are. So then they’ll say we have more cases. Now look, we want to do testing, we want to do everything, but they use it to make us look bad. But because of it, our mortality rate is so low. It’s so great what’s happening. So we want to test. So we do all these tests, and we find pockets, and we find people, and we find cases and they say the cases have jumped. Instead of saying what a job we’re doing with testing. But we did the job with testing. And we did ventilators. We came up with tests that nobody’s… We have so many different types of tests. We have the five minutes test, the 10 minutes test. We have tests, you send them to a public lab, a privately. We have tests. It’s a lot of tests.

… privately. We have tests… It’s a lot of tests and other countries that have done very well with testing they call us, they say, “There’s nobody that’s been able to do the job that you’ve done.” Now, the only ones that can’t get to say that are the fake news media people, they can say. Someday, it will be recognized by history, someday. But our actions and your selfless sacrifice. And that’s what has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We had to do it and we did the right thing. I’ll tell you what we did the right thing. Now we open, we got to get it open because I said, I got to get it open. People need it. People get sick from the other also, it’s not just from the virus that gets sick from all of the other things that happen. You know what I mean?

We cut through red tape to accelerate breakthrough therapies and vaccines. We’re going to have a vaccine very soon. We distributed 1. 5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment. We unleashed the medical and logistical power of the United States military. And thanks to our efforts, not a single American who needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. That’s impossible. That’s impossible.

Remember when the New York governor, governor Cuomo said he needs 40,000 ventilators and people said, “No, no, you need 4,000, maybe 5,000.” Anyway, we got him what we thought was right. They never needed all of them. In fact, they gave some to other people, but he didn’t need 40… 40,000 as opposed to 4,000 or 5,000, then it worked out great. Then he wanted a hospital built in the Javits Convention Center. We built it, but he didn’t use it. He could have used it for the older people. It was brand new, not infected, no infection. Then he wanted the boat. He wanted the boat to come up. Beautiful, beautiful hospital ship. You know what that is called, right? And it came up. They could have used it for senior citizens. They didn’t use it. It’s a shame. It’s a shame. It’s a shame. We’re now the chief ventilator producer, anywhere in the world.

We’re helping other countries with ventilators because ventilators are very hard to make. They’re very complex. They are big and expensive and many countries are calling us, asking for help. They need ventilators and we’re able to do it because we’re making thousands of ventilators. Think of this thousands of ventilators a week. And to rescue the US economy, which is happening now. We pass over $3 trillion in relief measures. We suspended student loan payments and interest for college students. And to protect jobs for young Americans, just like you, we took historic action to block the entry of foreign workers into our nation. We believe that companies should hire American workers and American students first. They have to hire. We got to go American. We got to go American. We were down to 3.4, 3.5% unemployment and that’s one thing, but now we’ve got to get it back to those numbers. Then we can think, right? Then we can think about taking people in through merit, only through merit or mostly through a merit. I better say mostly because they’ll say that’s a terrible thing. You can’t make a little bit of a slip. They’ll say, “He said only what about this? What about that?” Generally speaking, we like merit. Okay. We want American students to fill American jobs. That’s the biggest difference between us and the left. We know that our first duty is to take care of our citizens, make America great again. So before the plague came in, we had the best of everything. We had the best interest rates. We had the best unemployment rates. We had the best job numbers ever. We had everything. Unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans had all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. It’s amazing how many categories, young people, young people without a high school diploma, young people without a college diploma. We were number one on every list you can think of. Women 75 years, not as good, I’m sorry. But it was getting ready to hit the all time. Women it was the best in 75 years. So I have to apologize. Can you believe that we did the best in 75 years and I apologize to women. But we were ready to hit the old time. And then we got hit by something that should have never happened because they could’ve stopped it. Young people have seen their wages rise by more than 10%. They’d never seen anything like that.

We built the strongest and most prosperous economy in the history of the world. And we will do it again very, very quickly. It’s happening already. We’ve just added two and a half million jobs last month. Think of that. That’s the largest increase in the history of our country, two and a half million jobs in one month. And just to add the topping, as I mentioned, the 18% in retail sales, the surge was the biggest jump ever recorded in this country. The stock market in the last 50 days is the best stock market in history. And it went up today again, by the way, think of that, think of that.

Go back a week, 50 days, the strongest 50 days in stock market history. This is during hopefully the end of the pandemic, but as we fight to restore renew and rebuild our country, the hard left is trying to divide, denigrate, and destroy our country. The American people have watched in horror as left wing extremists have looted businesses, violently assaulted innocent civilians, and brutally injured hundreds and hundreds of police officers. Our great police officers. They even vandalized, that’s right, the Lincoln Memorial. The Lincoln Memorial. The radical left thinks the future belongs to them. No, the future belongs to you. It belongs to people that love our country.

So we’re not going to take moral lectures from the same left wing ideologues who oppose school choice, who support deadly sanctuary cities, who want to defend our police to fund and abolish our police. Think of it, to fund and abolish is now their theme and who preside over the violence and mayhem of the 20 most dangerous cities in America, 20 for 20. 20, most dangerous run by Democrats and it’ll happen to our country. If a guy like Joe Biden gets in. Because Joe Biden has no control over what’s happening. They won’t even be talking to him. The murder rate in Detroit and Baltimore is higher than that of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Afghanistan. But the left launches no protests over these travesties. There are travesties. Because it doesn’t serve their radical agenda. Think of that, tougher than Afghanistan, all run by Democrats while their movement is based on hate. Ours is based on love. Love of our family. Love of our nation and love of our fellow citizens.

We embrace the noble vision of Reverend Martin Luther King jr. And believed that people should not be judged based on the color of their skin, but the content of their character. This is a choice of two futures. The left’s vision of this unity and discord or our vision of equal opportunity and equal justice. Every American should take a long look at the bedlam in Seattle, because that’s exactly what will come to every city near you, every suburb and community in America. If the radical left Democrats are put in charge. They want to abolish ICE. Do you have any idea how patriotic ICE people are? I know them. They are very tough. They’re very tough. I agree. They like to fight. I agree.

But you don’t want to… I’m looking at some pretty tough guys right here. Look, you’re not going to do. He’s not going into an MS 13 ness, swinging, swinging. These guys are tough. They’re smart. They getting them out by the thousands to take in MS 13, out of our country, by the thousands. They want to abolish ICE, get rid of ICE, abolish bail. There want no bail anymore. Just we put you in for murder. It’s okay, come back, whenever you have a chance. You see what’s going on in some places like Philadelphia, what’s happening in Philadelphia. What’s happening in other cities. Look at what’s going on in Chicago. What’s that all about? Chicago is a great city, but they want to abolish borders and abolish every police department in the country.

The Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail in ballots, using the China virus, as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls. Hey, we have a virus coming, we have to send… Think of it, California. He’s going to be sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, where are they going? Where are these ballots going? Who’s getting them? Who is not getting them? Little section that’s Republican. Will they be stolen from mailboxes, as they get put in by the mailman? Will they be taken from the mailman and the mailwoman? Will they be forged? Who is signing them? Who’s signing them. What are they signed at a kitchen table and sent in? Will they be counterfeited by groups inside our nation? Will they be counterfeited maybe by the millions by foreign powers who don’t want to see Trump win? Because nobody has been tougher on trade or making our country great again. Nobody. No mail in ballots is a disaster for our country. It’s going to end up in a big fight.

Look just forget about all of this stuff. Forget about speeches and teleprompters and all of that. They send out millions of ballots. Who’s getting them? How are they delivered? Who’s not getting them? Think of it. It’s going to be fraud all over the place. If you look right now, look at all of the disputes they’re having on mail in ballots. A friend of mine who was a great guy, had a son who passed away seven years ago, seven years ago. He came to see me the other day. He said, “They just sent to my son Robert, a mail in ballot.” He died seven years ago. There’s no way they can control that. With mail in ballots, you introduce something in the middle of an election year and you have something where it’s very complex. You have no time to fix this very complex process. It’s very complex. This will be in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country and we cannot let this happen. They want it to happen so badly.

We believe in the sacred principle of one person, one vote. And that’s why we are fighting for the integrity of our elections. Absentee ballots are fine. Absentee ballots are fine. I live in the white house. If I can’t get to Florida or you live wherever you live, you can’t. But you have to go through a process. Some people just can’t make it to a polling station and they have good reason, but they have to go through this process in order to verify their identity. People went to the polls and voted during World War I. They went to the polls and voted during World War II. We can safely go to the polls and vote during COVID-19.

There’s tremendous evidence of fraud, whenever you have mail in ballots. Frankly, if we are really going to protect our elections and some people don’t want to hear this, we must have voter ID. So as long as I’m president, America will be a land of fair laws, swift justice, and safe communities. That’s why when rioting and looting broke out in our nation’s capital, I quickly deployed. I came in, I deployed the national guard very quickly. Mark Meadows was there. We had a lot of our people there. We stopped the violence. We saved that incredible statue you saw it last night. And restored peace and order to the streets. Although I will tell you, they did great damage to the cannons that were on the ground. They did great damage, but we’ll get them fixed. We’ll get them fixed, lock them up, lock them up.

It’s incredible how they can do it. Incredible. Well, they did damage. We lucky we just got there in time. You saw the ropes going up. We got that just… I’ll tell you, law enforcement did a great job. They rushed in. They rushed in. These people fought back and the law enforcement was much tougher, much sharper, much better. They really had no trouble handling them. It was like handling a baby for them. It was just like a baby. A lot of spoiled people in that group. A lot of spoiled rich people saying, “What are you doing here?” I’ve also made clear that any rioters damaging federal property and defacing our monuments will face severe and lengthy criminal penalties, 10 years. Many of the young people here today have had your own encounters with left wing extremists, such as Antifa. Joining us today are two students from North Carolina State University. Great place. Great state, Chris Thomas and Jack Bishop, please come on up fellas. Come on up.
Great job fellows. Thank you. So I signed an executive order, as you know, and based on what I’m just hearing, you should maybe be talking to Charlie or somebody around here about defunding that school. You can’t do that. Because that’s exactly what the executive order was based on. So you talked to the people, maybe have your father call us. His father’s a great Congressman, done a great job. So say hello to him. But you talk to them. That’s exactly what it was for. We did something that was radical, but it wasn’t radical to me. You have to be heard. And if you can’t be heard, let’s talk about it. Okay. As the radical left inflict violence on American streets, they’re also waging war on timeless American values like freedom of speech, which is what we’re just talking about.

Anyone who dares to speak the truth is canceled, censored, deplatformed, fired, expelled, harassed, abused, boycotted deprived of a livelihood or even physically assaulted. Those times will be changing very soon. You can judge a movement by its behavior and the young patriots here today, don’t destroy property. You don’t burn buildings, you don’t punish the centers, and you don’t try to erase the people with whom you disagree. It’s called civilized people. You’re civilized people. And yet, remember I said this, you’re civilized, but you’re much tougher than the other side. You’re much tougher, much tougher. You conduct yourselves with honor, integrity, and dignity because you know the truth, the facts, and the history all on your side. We’re joined today by Reagan Escada a student at Northwestern State University of Louisiana. Reagan became a target of liberal cancel culture when she dared to stand up for Christian…

… Cancel culture when she dared to stand up for her Christian values, instead of bowing to political correctness. Reagan, please come up and say a few words please.
Thank you Reagan. That was beautiful. As your story reminds us Reagan, true courage is defying the left’s orthodoxy, not submitting to it. We don’t submit, nobody should be submitting because we’re winning and we’re going to win, but you don’t submit to fake news progressive companies right there. They’re right back there watching us. Other institutions merely towing the left wing line have sacrificed their intellectual credibility and professional integrity. They have very little integrity left. Some of them have none. You’re the ones taking real risks. You’re showing real guts and making a virtuous stand.

With the rise of social media massive multinational tech companies have tried to clamp down on American democracy. That even means on me. As everyone knows, they’re using their enormous power to silence conservative voices, you know that. It’s not even close. I don’t even think they’re hiding it anymore. To protect our democracy I signed an executive order to remove legal protections for social media companies that unjustly censor American citizens. The radical left is also working to eliminate free speech on our college campuses. With us today is Nia Moore, a student at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, whose experience is persecution firsthand. Nia, please come up, please.
Thank you. Thank you Nia. Well Nia I want to just tell you, first of all thank you very much, and so heartfelt. I could see that. I also issued a historical executive order defending free speech and all of this is on college campuses. I will tell you that it’s something that’s being used by people like Charlie and used very well. It’s opening up a whole new voice, and it’s my honor to have done it under my order. Any college that refuses to let you speak stands to lose billions of dollars in terms of the [ 01:29:15]. We’ve done a lot. We’ve really gone very far. We’ve taken it to a level that nobody’s ever taken it, and it’s my honor to have done it. It’s people like you that I do it for. When you think about it, it’s people like you. You’re going to be the ones, you’re going to be the ones that are at the crossroads of history. That’s where you are right now, you’re at a crossroads.
 
Everything our forefathers built, everything generations past, they shed their blood to defend the very survival of our freedoms, our rights and our republic. They’re all at stake. This is a very big time in our country. It’s a time like perhaps no other. But standing here before you today I have never been more confident that America will rise to new heights of greatness and glory. Because your generation is proving that your hearts are filled with the fire and the fervor of true American patriots. The great spirit of righteous defiance stirs deep within you I see that. It’s the same spirit that drove America’s founders and frontiersmen, people that built our nation. People that succeeded, people that worked hard, people that failed, people that failed. Some people failed and then they made it bigger than anyone would have ever believed possible. To defend all of your liberties, to secure your independence and establish this noble fortress of freedom.

It’s the same spirit that compels each of you to stand strong against the dull, mindless, soul-crushing conformity mandated by far left pundits, professors and liberal politicians. They’re taking our country in the wrong direction. It’s the same fierce and untamed American spirit that will lead the young patriotic Americans of this generation to serve our country, and you will serve it well, you will serve it so well. Together we will restore our economy quickly. We will rebuild our nation. We will revitalize our cities. We will take back our universities and colleges, and we will preserve the America we love for you and for your children.

We will defend our values, our voices, our faith, our heritage, our borders, our rights, and our God- given freedoms. Calling on the boldness and bravery of your generation, we will unite citizens of every race and color, religion and creed as one people, one family, and one extraordinary nation under God. With your help, this moment will be a turning point in American history that will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come for our young people, for our economy, for our communities and for our beloved country. The best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.",23/6/20
"
Thank you very much. What a nice group of people. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to treat you right. They’re not. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to change that around quickly.

Pat, I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time. I’ve known you for a long time. You do one hell of a job, and you’re pretty popular with these people I see. [ 00:00:28]. Thank you, Pat. Well, maybe I’ll say a few words. It’s appropriate in light of everything that’s going on. When you look at all of the statistics, all of the numbers, New York’s finest, I love, and you’re the finest, they just don’t let you do the job [ 00:00:44]. They won’t let you do your job, that’s all it is.

So it’s my great honor to proudly accept something that Pat’s going to give me in a little while, so I’ll hold off on the word endorsement, but he’s going to give me an endorsement, I understand. And I have deeply and profoundly admired the brave men and women, as you know, of New York City’s finest, and I’ve admired you my whole life. My whole life I’ve watched you do a job like nobody else. Nobody else has done it. And truly, you’re the best of the best and I’m grateful. And I’m very happy that you’re here, and we’ll have a little fun for a little while, but first we’re going to talk a little business. We have to talk business because we have to straighten out our city. Our city’s a mess.

Every day, the courageous offices of NYPD put your lives on the line to protect the innocent and to put violent criminals behind bars. You protect people you’ve never met before. You know, I’ve heard that expression a long time ago, and it always means something to me. You’re protecting people with your lives, people that you’ve never met before, and you’ve done an incredible job.

And the world will never forget the New York police offices who ran into the smoke and flames of 9/11, I was there, many never to return. We salute the heroes of NYPD and we salute our law enforcement heroes all across the nation. I was responsible, along with a couple of people that were right in this audience, for getting you some very good and large payments so that we can take care of some of the people that were hurt so badly. Longterm hurt they call it, right? Longterm hurt, but we got it done and we got it signed. We got it signed and we’re taking of a lot of people.

And we want to thank our great firefighters also, right alongside of you, right? Our great firefighters.

As we gather today, our country is suffering from a radical far left movement. It’s not even to be believed when you see this, what they’re thinking. Where did these people come from? Where do they come from? That is trying to defame, demoralize, defund, dismantle, and dissolve our great police departments. It’s a left wing war on cops.

If Sleepy Joe Biden were to become precedent, he would immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America. You know that. And probably, she’s a step worse. She’s a step worse, Kamala. I was sort of hoping he was going to pick Pocahontas, but that she’s of Indian heritage number. Remember I said I have more Indian than her, I have more Indian than she does? And I went into it. I went into it at great length and I turned out to be right. I have none and I had more than she had. She’s another beauty.

Portland and Chicago are the left’s roadmap to America, and sadly, what’s happened over the last year in New York City. And it’s an incredible thing to look at, an incredible, incredible thing. And I just saw somebody here named Rudy Giuliani. Do you know Rudy Giuliani? Where’s Rudy? Is he around here? Get up here, Rudy. Get up. What are you doing down there, Mr. Mayor? This the greatest Mayor our city has ever had. Rudy, come on up here. Come on up. What a great… And he’s a man who is loyal and dedicated and tough. He got on television to defend me. He said things that even I wouldn’t say. He was brutal. He is incredible. He knew. He got it.

Joe Biden’s national police strategy will be modeled on the Bill DeBlasio, catastrophe. It’s a catastrophe. No one will be safe in Biden’s American, no city, no town, no suburb will be spared. And you see how I did something to help the suburbs of our country last week? A lot of people don’t want to even talk about it, but we did something that nobody else would have done. They’re ruining your suburbs. They want to ruin it. They want to destroy their housing values and your safety. But we ended it. We ended the program entirely. Somebody said, “Let’s amend it.” I said, “No, let’s end it.”

The Biden-Harris agenda, and I guess Harris could be bigger than you think in terms of the importances of vice president. They said there’s never been a more important pick, but in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re going to win. [ 00:05:34]. You know, honestly, we don’t have a choice. We have to win. This country will go to hell. The stock markets will crash. Your 401ks are going to be worthless. You’ll see. You’ll see what would happen, crime all over the place.

I mean, you take a look at Portland. You take a look at Chicago, and I can name plenty of other cities, but I don’t want to embarrass anybody. My agenda is anti-crime and pro-cop all the way and that’s what it’s got to be.

So in recent months, New York City has witnessed the horrors that result from putting extreme left politicians into power. DeBlasio has launched a crusade against, and he really has, he has launched a real crusade against the police like I don’t think anybody’s ever really seen, but there are cases that are just as bad. There are some cases, radical left, that may be even are worse.

The mobs have scrawled disgusting slogans such as cops must die. Think of this, cops must die and kill all cops. Okay? Who would even have thought 10 years ago that was possible? On the side of buildings, they put those terms. And they vandalized St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, with horrible, horrible statements, horrible phrases. And then of course that disgusting chant, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” right? Remember that?

And now, all of a sudden, it becomes mainstream. It becomes, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful?” They were talking about you. You know that, right? We just can’t forget it because we have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country, and we’re doing it. Wherever we go, we do it. But when you have the radical left running it, no good.

Rioters have rampaged through Manhattan and looted Fifth Avenue and an NYPD Sargent was left, as you know very well, in critical condition after being rundown with a car. A Molotov cocktail was thrown into a police vehicle in Brooklyn. And NYPD’s highest ranking uniform chief and other offices were beaten in broad daylight on the Brooklyn Bridge. And they’re not allowed to fight back. You’re not allowed to fight back. You fight back, you lose your pension, you lose your life. They put you in jail you fight back. No, you got to be able to fight back.

I mean, to me, one of the saddest, and I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but one of the saddest things, Rudy, that I’ve ever seen, Pat, was when they were dumping water on the heads of two of your fellow officers. And I wish they fought back. I promise nothing would have happened to them. Because who even knew that was water? It could have been plenty of other things. It probably was actually. But it could have been some very dangerous material, not water. And they didn’t fight back. The first time I’ve ever seen that. I wish they did. I wish they did. I wish I could have talked to them. I said, “Fight back. I swear you’ll be protected.”

This is the left’s vision for the future of the United States of America. If they win this election, November 3rd, got to get out, got to get everybody you know. You know, the Democrats have an advantage because they have certain people that automatically vote. And we’re going from New York. We’re going for New York [ 00:09:02]. Because we did well last time. You know, New York is not supposed to be Republican territory. It was Ronald Reagan. But a lot of the people left. A lot of the people that voted for Ronald Reagan left. That was the last time. And they voted for Ronald Reagan, but they left. They went on to other places. They got tired of being abused and high taxes and all of the other problems.

And we’re going to go and run and we’re going to run on law and order, and we’re going to run our lower taxes, and we’re going to run on doing something with salt. You know what the salt is? Remember Schumer? Schumer said, “I try and bring home things to my people in New York.” You know what he brought home? Salt. For those of you that don’t know, look it up. It’s not good.

But if they win this election, every city in America will be under siege. You know that. Because the police are good in Seattle and they’re good in all of these different places I talked about. They’re not being let do their job. Can’t do their job.

Their pro-crime agenda, the Biden-Harris group will also crush our economy because there is no prosperity in cities that are ruled by fear. And I even think the politicians are afraid. If you look at Portland, the Mayor is trying to say, “Oh, these are my friends.” And then he goes in there, they want to beat the hell out of him. And then the fake news doesn’t report that. They’ll show him standing there with the sound down so you don’t hear what they’re saying to the Mayor. Fortunately, he had five body guards when he went in, right? But it was very dangerous for him. And I don’t know if he’s doing this at a stupidity or out of fear. Because I think they’re afraid actually.

Yeah. It sounds like one my friends.

My administration has made clear that the Department of Justice will partner arm-in-arm with our police heroes. And we’re with you all the way and we’ll prosecute all federal violations to the fullest extent of the law. But you know, we have to be invited in, unless we do something very drastic, which is a big statement, but we have to be invited in. But you don’t need help. You guys don’t need help. You have the greatest police force in the world. You have the greatest in the world. All they have to do is tell your top people to do your job and you’re going to do it properly. You’re not going to do something in excess to what [ 00:11:26], but they want to tell you to do your job and you’re not going to have any crime in New York. It’s going to go down like it did with Rudy Giuliani. It’s going to go down so fast.

That happened quickly, Rudy. That didn’t take too long.

That didn’t take too long. You, he looks good enough. Let’s draft Rudy. You better be careful, he’d win it. He’d win very easily. Because people want that back. They want it back. That’s why I think, I really am, I’m putting it into play. Most people would say, “Oh, spend your time in other places,” but I’m going to put it. We did very well. We did incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various, Staten Island was-

Incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various … Staten Island was great, right? Staten Island was great. By the way, Joe Rose is a disaster. I will tell you that. I hope they get him out of there. He’s a total lightweight in many ways. Joe Rose, get him out.
He turns out he’s another beauty. My administration will so increase funding for police so that we can hire more police offices nationwide. We’re increasing funding very substantially. And in many cases, they don’t want it. They want to put into a different group. I said, “What’s that group all about?” And it’s called socialism, and it doesn’t work. Never will work.
By contrast, New York City voted to defund the police by $1 billion, if you can believe it, even after experiencing the bloodiest June in nearly 25 years. It’s dismantled an elite team of crime fighters, that crime fighting unit that your friends, there were incredible people. They were making us all safe. Nationwide, they were making us safe and we got to get them back. We got to bring them back. Hopefully, they don’t get a job for too much money. Tell them not to look too hard because we’re going to bring them back. We’ll get them back. They’re the best. [Rudy 00:13:17] started that. They’re the best. Joe Biden and Kamala, they always say Kamala, Kamala, Harris have a plan to spread this mayhem to every community in America.

Now, in all fairness to Joe, he doesn’t really know what’s happening. They say, “Joe, we’re going to spread it around. Oh, okay. Okay.” This guy doesn’t answer any questions. He gets up today. He made a statement. I just did an incredible deal with UAE. You saw that, right? Everyone’s shocked. Even the New York Times said it was incredible deal. Can you believe? The New York Times? I can’t even believe it. Thomas Friedman, they wrote an incredible editorial. It was a great deal. So we did this deal. Nobody else did it. In fact, we were at a huge deficit because of the horrible deal that Obama made with Iran. Gave them $150 billion, billion, not million. 150 million’s a lot. That would be too much also. 150 billion then gave them 1.8 billion in cash. I broke the deal. I terminated the deal, but we made a deal, UAE and Israel. And sleepy Joe got up and said he made the deal. I said, “Whoa.” Did anybody hear that? He actually took credit for making that deal.
For a change, I’m being praised all over the world for making that deal, and that’s just the beginning. I think they just said, “Say this Joe. Say that you made it.” It’s like it was Obama’s economy right? Before the plague, we had the greatest economy in history. Greatest economy anywhere in the world, let alone ours. And now we’re building it back up very rapidly. You see the numbers. But they were taking credit. They said, “Oh, this was Obama. Obama.” He said manufacturing would never come back. That was Obama. Manufacturing has come back big. In fact, even two days ago, they announced incredible numbers. When asked recently if he favors cutting police budget, Biden replied. “Yes, absolutely.” But I’m not sure honestly he knew what he was replying to so we’re not … “Yes, absolutely. What did I say? What was I referring to?” You could use that clip for a million different things right? Yes, absolutely. You never say that as a politician. You always finish out.

Biden has been described by police as and he described the police, you saw that, as the enemy. He said it’s the enemy. Kamala Harris applauded LA’s recent decision to slash its police budget, and LA really went to town on it, you saw that. Millions and millions of dollars off their budget. After the riots in Minneapolis, Kamala encouraged Americans to donate money to the so-called Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out rapists, assaulters and murderers. They bailed them right out of jail. Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. We can’t lose this election. Okay?
We can’t loose.
We’re building a big wall. We’re building the wall. It’s up to almost … Look at her. She’s all excited about that. That’s-
Yeah, we’re building. It’s up to 280 miles. Will be up … That’ll be completed-
You’re right. I like her. No, you’re right. And you know who like the wall? The Southern border, you know who like at the most? Hispanics, because they know the area. They know what comes in and they want to be safe. They want to keep their good jobs. They want to keep their beautiful houses. They’ve done well, but they know the area the best. We’re doing great with the Hispanics. As San Francisco district attorney, she chose not to seek the death penalty against a gang member who killed a San Francisco police officer going against the wishes of the officer’s wife, going against the wishes of the police. In his unity manifesto written with socialist … Bernie Sanders is another beauty, Bernie. Crazy Bernie. We’ve got names for all of them no? What’s better? Sleepy Joe or slow Joe? Tell me.
What is better?
I go back and forth.
Okay, let’s do it. Who likes Slow Joe?
Who likes Sleepy Joe?
That’s what I thought. I got all these guys telling me, “Oh, you ought to do. We don’t like sleepy because it’s rude.” They said it’s rude. I said, “We’re talking about the president of the United States.” I can tell you one thing. Putin and Kim Jong Un and President Xi of China, they’re not sleepy. We’re never going to say sleepy or slow, and we can’t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them either because we were doing very well against all of them. All of them. And we’re have a good relationship now. Remember North Korea? We were going to go to war with North Korea. Obama would have been in a war. Millions of people could have been killed in that war. Where’s the war? Everybody said, “Trump will be in war in the first week.” Where’s the war? In fact, we’re bringing people out of the endless Wars. The Wars that where their doing your job. They’re policemen and that’s great, but they want to fight. They want to win. We didn’t let people win. Bring them back. We shouldn’t have been there in the first place. So we bring them back, and what we’re doing is bringing them back with great dignity.

It’s incredible what’s happened. We’ve totally rebuilt our armed forces, $2.5 trillion. We’ve given you hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Pat, you know that. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment came out of … It was collecting dust, right? It was army surplus stuff and all the different … It was beautiful stuff and Obama didn’t want you to have it. They said it made you look too strong, too tough. You look too military. So they said, “Let them get shot.” Much of it was protective equipment. You know that. I released it all. I gave it to all the police departments all across the country and I have had more thank yous for that. And someday, they’re going to have to explain why they didn’t want to do it. And this was sitting there. It was not going to be used. A lot of it was new, but it wasn’t going to be used. And I said, “Give it to our great police all over the country.” And we did and it’s been great.

And just to finish up, I call it the manifesto because Bernie Sanders, he was going to make an agreement and they were going to go a little bit further right. They didn’t. They went further left than Bernie was. So in the manifesto, Biden pledges to abolish cash bail. How about that? No cash bail. No bail, meaning that violent and dangerous criminals would simply be released after arrest. New York tried this insane policy and crime surged nearly 25% in New York City and now it’s up much, much higher than that. This is an old statistic. It’s up much higher than that. So nationwide, the Biden plan to abolish bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets.

So all I’m saying is this. We have the greatest police departments. We have great police. We have great forces. They have to be allowed to do their job. And I’ve seen Pat and I’ve seen you. You’re going to have a bad apple. You’re going to have somebody who makes a horrible mistake. You’re going to have somebody has a bad moment, but it may be just a bad apple. We’ve seen it. But that doesn’t mean we’re going to close up our police departments. And like in Minneapolis, tell them to run. Leave, leave. Did you ever see anything like that? Where they left? Where they left? We can’t ever let that happen. We sent in the National Guard five or six days later. We waited, we waited, we waited. Within one hour, the whole thing was … You never heard of anything. On these monuments and statues, you saw that? They were trying to rip them down. They ripped some down. I immediately signed an order that if you get caught ripping down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in jail. 10 years.

And I don’t know about you, I haven’t seen too many statues being ripped down lately. They were going to have a march on Washington, Washington. They wanted to rip down statues. I said, “So wait a minute. You’re going to rip down statues, you’re going to go to jail for 10 years.” I signed it publicly. Very public. You got to let them know or otherwise, it’s not fair. They get 10 years, they didn’t know about it right? Wise guys. So we let them know you get 10 years in jail. I took an old law because they don’t do those laws today. Today, get that through the house. Tell Nancy Pelosi we’re going to give somebody 10 years. She’s terrible. Look at what’s happened to San Francisco. Look at the tents. Look at the homeless. That’s Nancy. She ought to go home and clean up her own city, but take a look.

But it’s 10 years in jail. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They were going to come down and knock down. They had them earmarked. And as soon as they announced that, nobody showed up. It was amazing. Big march, nobody showed up. They said, “No, we’re going to do it the following …” That was a Thursday night. “We’re going to do it the next night, Friday.” Nobody showed up except four people. They all got arrested because they were the four people that the media had on top of the statue of Andrew Jackson doing damage. Almost got it down. And I’ll say something. The Washington, the D.C. police were great because they had the ropes. You saw the ropes. They were ready to pull it down. They were all set and our guys said, “Stop it.” And those guys ran in and that thing was over. Those Washington, those D.C. police did a job. That wasn’t like you know. They did a job. So we’re going to give you back your stature. We’re going to give you back your status. I hate to say it, but it’s been taken away. We’re going to give you back the right to be New York’s finest, the finest of all time, the greatest of all time, and we’re going to win on November 3rd. And the people that didn’t love Trump, never Trumpers, a lot of them are saying, “I’m starting to like Trump a lot,” because they see what’s happening. And we’re going to give New York a real shot and I think we have one hell of a shot at doing it. I just said this morning, the New York Post, which has been great. The New York post had a cover story about that. They came and interviewed me at the Oval Office and they talked about law and order in the city. And I said, “I did very well, Republican wise. I did very well.” We did great, and I really believe that that solid core of people has to be real. First of all, they’re leaving. A lot of them are leaving, but they have to be discuss-

I mean first of all they are leaving a lot of them are leaving, but they have to be disgusted with what’s going on. So I said then and there and I said it today. I put it out today strongly, we’re going to go and give New York a real shot. I think we have a real chance of winning New York, but we’re going to give you so much of what you’re looking for. Because I know exactly it’s so easy you need leadership, you need money, you can’t defund. It has to go the other way. You need equipment.

But what do you need more than anything else is your dignity and respect. You need respect, you need your dignity back and this guy has taken your dignity away and your respect away. And I am telling you on November 3rd you’re going to be getting it back like you haven’t gotten it back before. Because this is really a referendum. So I want to thank you very much. And Pat, thank you very much. Fellas thank you.
How does the oval office for that sound? Okay? Good?
Well, I just want to thank you that was incredible. I assumed it was given out because I see a lot of things given out and they shouldn’t be given out. But a special man, you are just really special people. You really are. You’re very brave people. I will say this, you read a lot of negatives. They have a lot of fake media, fake news, false news, call it whatever you want, corrupt news. But you have no idea how much the people of this country love our police departments, our police, our law enforcement, our border patrols, our ICE people. ICE they go into the toughest situations. They take out MS13 by the thousands and then they get abused. But they’re not really abused, they’re loved by the people of this country. And New York’s great police force is something that I grew up with.
I used to go with my father in Brooklyn to a little, I shouldn’t tell you this, a little hamburger place for lunch. And we’d see these big cops come in and they were great. And everybody stood at attention when they walked in and we’re going to get that back. You’re respected just the same, but they don’t allow it to happen. We’re going to allow it to happen. You are great, great people. And remember this, you are loved by our country, loved by our country and respected by our country.

And all we have to do is let you do your job, right? Just let you do your job. Pat, I think it might be appropriate. So we really do. We have New York city’s greatest mayor of all time. He took over a city that I don’t know, was worse. Maybe better. I don’t know what I’m going to ask Rudy what’s the difference between that city and the city of today? Certainly it caught up very quickly for a long while it was a lot better, but when Rudy ran it, it was incredible. The crime statistics, the murder. I hate to use that word, murder. I don’t know if this place has ever heard that word murder. It’s not into the word of murder.

But when you look at the stats, I looked at them the other day it was incredible what he was able to do in a short period of time with only New York’s finest. Without New York’s finest he couldn’t have done it. He let them do the job and he had three very great commissioners. He keeps telling me three great commissioners. I always say, “Who is the best?” He doesn’t want to tell me maybe he’ll tell you. But I’ve asked him many times, “Who is the best Rudy I want to know who? Who is the best?” He’ll never tell me, but there’s always the best, right? There’s always somebody. But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words.

But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words and we love you all. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Does anyone else want to speak. Does anyone else want to … So again, it’s an honor that you came. I just want to pay my respects to a really good guy that I love. It’s my brother, he’s very ill and he would not have … I mean, he just said, “Don’t even think about it.” I really appreciate what he said. He’s having a very tough time, but I really appreciate being with you today. He respected you as much as I do. He respected you, like everybody. We all respect you and we’re going to let you do your job. We’re going to let you do your job. That’s all we have to do. Again, thank you very much. It’s such an honor to be with you, to get the endorsement pad of this group of incredible men and women is mind-blowing. Really it is.
Mind blowing and just, I’m going to leave you with this very simple phrase. I will never, ever let you down. I will never let you down. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.",14/8/20

Well hello Oshkosh. Wow! I don’t know what happened. Something happened. This was supposed to be just a quick little small gathering. This is what’s happening and we call it a peaceful protest. We’re supposed to have 50 people, right? So we have a little more and they turned away a lot of people outside. So we’ll call it a peaceful protest. That way we could do whatever we want.

You know that’s what they call it in New York and these different places Portland, when they’re rioting all over the streets they say it was a peaceful protest. So you can have thousands of people doing it we’ll do the same thing. I’m truly thrilled to be here with you. The hardworking patriots of Wisconsin. Thank you. Thank you. It’s a big group of people. This is like a rally I said it’s not supposed to be a rally. We’re not supposed to have a rally. I hereby grant to you a pardon. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Well, I want to thank you. Thank you. In the months ahead we will need every ounce of your strength and drive and patriotism. We’re in a fight for the survival of our nation and civilization itself. We are really in a fight. This is the most important election we’ve ever had in my opinion. And I used to say it and I’d say it with great conviction, 2016 but you know what? That wasn’t crazy people we were dealing. They were on the edge, crooked Hillary was on the edge. She was on the verge. She became crazy later on when she lost. That’s what she became. But these are people that are seriously radical left. Joe Biden is nothing but their puppet. He has no clue what’s happening.

And then baking speeches that are taped, who wants to listen to Michelle Obama do a tape speech? No, you got to have her get up there. But we’re doing a real speech on Thursday next Thursday, she’ll be listening. Doing it live from the white house, live from the white house. So we have plenty to say. So Joe Biden and the Democrats have pledged to oppose $4 trillion of new taxes. So this is a group of people that think it’s good to raise everybody’s taxes. In the old days a politician would lower taxes, right? The great Scott Walker is here, your governor. Scott would lower taxes, but now the whole thing I guess it’s changed. It’s gotten inside out. Now everybody says we’re going to raise your taxes, but Republicans are lowering your taxes. We gave you the biggest tax decrease of the history of our country and we’re going lower.

But they’re going to massively increase your regulations. In addition to your taxes, they’re going to confiscate the guns of law abiding Americans. They’re going to take away your second amendment. They’re going to make America a sanctuary for criminal aliens. They’re going to keep those sanctuary cities. They love sanctuary cities. They’re going to protect the criminals, abolish American energy and make us reliant on foreign nations and force taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. That’s what they’re doing. They also want to abolish the suburbs by allowing far left Washington bureaucrats to force the construction of low income housing projects in every neighborhood in America. That’s what they want to do, that’s their goal. And we’re going to let you preserve your American dream in the suburbs. Okay? We ended the program. We ended the program. The voters of Wisconsin are very, very spectacular people. We are going to take care of you at every level. We are going to fight for you. We are going to fight for every single aspect that you have going. We are never going to forget you. You didn’t forget me in the last election so I want to thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. I want to thank you very much. It’s great. So we issued a regulation and we ended that regulation because when we talk about suburbs and we talk about other things we have taken care of about 84% of Obama regulations, executive orders. It’s amazing. We knocked out a big portion of what he did, including the wonderful mandate, right? The individual mandated Obamacare, which totally by the way, by far the worst of all of Obamacare. We took it out, essentially that ended Obamacare. And then you say so we knocked out 84% of what he did and then they say he was a wonderful president. Why was he a wonderful president if we knocked out in a very popular way knocked out 84%? The voters of Wisconsin face a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the radical left mob or do you want to stand tall as free men and women in the greatest country on earth and keep it that way?

Do you want to crush our economy under the crazy socialist policies of sleepy Joe Biden and his boss Kamala Harris? And his other boss Nancy Pelosi, she’s a beauty. And his ruler Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. Or do you want to quickly rebuild the strongest economy in the history of the world? Which we did. We’re going to have to do it again. We’re going to have to do it again and we’re in the process of doing it.

We’ve built the greatest economy on earth and now we’re doing it again. You look at all the numbers, we’re going to go over them. Do you want to fund and defame and dismantle the police? I don’t think so. Do you want to support the incredible heroes of law enforcement? Yes, right? Do you want your friends and family to be persecuted by the far left wing? It’s called cancel culture, right? Cancel culture. Or do you want to defend our history, our heroes, our faith, our values and our treasured American way of life, which is what we have?

Now don’t believe the lies you’re going to hear on tape. Most of it is going to be tape. I wonder is Joe Biden taping his speech too because if he is, I think I’ll tape mine. How do you watch a tape? They talk about a convention. How do you watch a tape speech? I would imagine Joe is going to do everything he can to tape it. I saw them asking him questions today. It was a news conference and he read them off a teleprompter. I don’t get it. I don’t get it. Something going on up there. We can’t afford it. I can tell you this look, from doing this now we’ve built the greatest economy in the world, we rebuilt our military, we gave you the greatest tax cuts in history, we gave you the greatest regulation cuts. We became energy independent. We’ve done things that nobody thought possible, right? Nobody thought possible. We’ve done things that nobody ever thought you had the greatest year in the history of your state last year, greatest year. And when you look at the numbers, you’re going to have an even greater year next year, unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes. In which case it’s called the depression folks. It’s called it depression. It’s not going to happen because we’re going to win. Biden is just a Trojan horse for socialism. He’s a Trojan horse. He has no clue, but the people around him are tough and they’re smart. But we disagree with them very, very strongly. They’re mean and they’re angry like her. By the way, nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kamala, right? She was worse than Pocahontas, She was worse than anybody on stage. Nobody treated him worse or with less respect. She had no respect. All of a sudden she’s now saying he’s the wonderful. She didn’t feel that way a little while ago. Let’s talk about her for a second. She left in shame. She started at 14 she left at two. She went in the wrong direction. So if a poll is any indication, that’s what we want, speak in the polls. Fake news, CNN. They probably have their cameras going thank you very much.

No, no, no. Frankly, their pollster’s much better than Fox because Fox has never gotten it right. Fox pollster I don’t know who he is, but he hasn’t had a clue for about seven years. Let me just tell you that CNN gave us an increase of 10 or 11 points in just a short period of time that we went up and now they call it margin of error. Don’t believe it. We’re way beyond the margin of error don’t believe it.

I just got back from Texas and Florida and Ohio. We were all over the place. We went to great states and every roadway and highway, we had thousands, tens of thousands. I would say at least on each one a hundred thousand people from the plane, because that’s why this isn’t a rally. This is again, friendly protest. We were not allowed to do rallies, right? Because of rules and regulations which we want to adhere to. But from the plane to an oil well, from the plane to getting law enforcement, all of the sheriffs in Florida gave us their full endorsement

And in Ohio we went to a plant Whirlpool. They were out of business, they were going out of business and now they’re a thriving company because they were dumping washing machines and dryers into our country and I stopped it. And I said, “You want to do that? We’re putting a massive tariff.” And all of a sudden Whirlpool and thousands of people that work in Ohio and other places it became a really terrific company again. And we went there. But if you look at the kind of enthusiasm we have, we have never had the enthusiasm that we have right now and that includes 2016.

And I hate to say it and I don’t want to be rude because I would never be rude. But let me just tell you Joe Biden has no enthusiasm. No enthusiasm and you don’t win without enthusiasm. People aren’t saying we got to get him in. The only reason they want him in is they want to stop our great agenda. That’s the only reason, that’s the only thing he has going. And nobody wins when you’re not on the side of enthusiasm. So we have more than we ever had in 2016. And in 2016 nobody has ever seen a campaign with that kind of enthusiasm. And we have much more now.

But the socialists will not stop until they’ve ransacked America and laid waste to our cities. Your eyes don’t lie look at Portland. It’s been turned into a war zone and we want to go in and solve it. We saved the courthouse, do you believe it? We had to send in Homeland security. They were great. They easily saved it after it was pounded. Portland was supposed to be watching it, but they weren’t. So we sent them in and we will send in the national guard just like we did in Minnesota. You saw what happened there, Minneapolis. The national guard went in within 15 minutes the whole thing was over. They should have called them in a week earlier.
 
My beautiful, beautiful fifth Avenue in New York has been looted in pillage. It was allowed to happen by an incompetent mayor that doesn’t have a clue. Look at what’s happened to our diamond. New York was a diamond for the country. Look how far it’s gone down. And Chicago, the mayor literally raised up the drawbridges to prevent hordes of rioters from ransacking the city. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? 17 officers were injured in Chicago. They had a week. A little while ago during a weekend spree where 78 people were shot-

During a weekend spree where 78 people were shot and 18 died. That’s worse than Afghanistan, which we’re getting out of. That’s worse than Iraq, which we’re almost out of. That’s worse than Syria, which we’re out of, except we kept the oil, but that’s okay. We don’t have to talk about that. But this is the future that Joe Biden plans to bring to every city, town, and suburb in our nation. And you know, for those suburbs, I keep hearing about suburban women. I made the … Oh. Well, in one speech recently, I called you suburban housewives and they all loved it, but what I got, they said, “Sir, I don’t know if that’s politically correct.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. They’ll get over it.” Right? But we saved the suburbs. The suburbs, and you know what I’m talking about. And they said about the rule, it’s a rule. Very strong. It’s like a law. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “No, I don’t want it amended.” “No, we can really amend it. Bring it down.” “No, I don’t want it. I want it terminated.” And we terminated it. It’s gone. And it’ll be re-instituted if Joe Biden comes in.

Not by him, because he has no idea what the law says or what it means, but by the people that will be running our country. It will not be him. It will not be him running our country. They will turn every city into a Portland and they wouldn’t mind. No one will be safe in a Biden run America. But while I’m president, the United States will use every tool and we’ve done it. By the way, our country is doing great. We have the pandemic should have never been allowed to happen by China. Should’ve never been allowed to happen.

They released it. They didn’t release it in China, but it came to the United States and Europe. 188 all over the world. 188 countries all over the world. We’re not going to forget it. We’re not going to forget it, but we’re doing great coming back. We’re coming back and our numbers are better than almost all countries. I will tell you that. Despite what you hear. Look at all of them up there. Scott, look at all of that fake news. It’s unbelievable.

Unfortunately, Fox has become fake news too. I don’t know what happens to these people, right? Do you agree? At least the other side, you know where they’re coming from. But I’ll use every tool at my disposal to arrest those violators of federal law and put them behind bars. And that’s what we’re doing. When they were ripping down the statues, our great statues, they were ripping them down. I passed and signed something that’s beautiful. It says 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue. Amazing.

What happened? What happened, Scott? I don’t see it anymore. Now they go up and they look at his statue and they say, “I don’t know. 10 years is a long time.” They say, “Let’s get out of here.” But did you notice that three months ago, I signed it. They will get to have thousands of people march on Washington to rip down statues. And these people are sick. They’re anarchists. They were going to knock down Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln. He was fair game. Abraham Lincoln. So I said, “These people are sick. They are troubled individuals. They’re anarchists and agitators. They’re not just protestors.” They call them peaceful protestors. You’re peaceful protestors on the record. You’re peaceful protestors.

And by the way, you’re a lot … Look at this guy over here. Look at the size of that guy. You’re a lot tougher than they are. Just so you understand that, right? Look at the size of that guy. But Biden and Harris are pro-crime and anti- cop. There’s no other way to say it. And we’re anti-crime, we are pro-cop all the way. I’ve gotten the endorsement. I got the endorsement. Pat Lynch, New York City police. They gave us an endorsement first time, I think. He said I think it’s the first time they’ve ever done it. That means it’s been a long time. They don’t do that kind of thing. They endorsed me. All the sheriffs in Florida endorsed me.

What you have all of the law enforcement in Texas endorsed me. We’re getting endorsement from … We haven’t found anybody that won’t endorse in law enforcement. We haven’t found anybody, and if we do, I think they’d probably be in big trouble. I really do. I think they’d be in big trouble because nobody could figure it out. We are getting the endorsement of law and these are great people. These are great Americans. These are people that want our people to be safe. So, we’re thrilled today to be joined by county sheriffs from across the state, and I am deeply honored to receive the endorsement of more than three dozen Wisconsin sheriffs. Where are you? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Thank you, fellas. They’re good looking people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I like that mask. MAGA. I wonder if he supports Trump? He’s got MAGA this big. I wonder if he’s a Trump … Hey, thank you, sheriffs. We appreciate it. Good looking guys. Good looking guys.

And I’ll never let you down, sheriffs. I’ll never let you down. You know that. We gave you all of the surplus equipment. We had millions and millions of dollars of surplus equipment and Obama and Biden didn’t want to give it. They didn’t want to give it. They thought it looked too militaristic, meaning it was … A lot of it was really defensive equipment so that we can keep our law enforcement safe. And I distributed it. All of hundreds of millions of dollars. It was sitting there drawing dust and warehouses that we were probably paying a fortune for all over the country, and you got it. We all got it. Everybody got it. And everybody’s happy.

As president and as your president, I will always stand with law enforcement, and that’s something that I can’t even imagine anybody saying anything differently, but this other side does. They say it differently. I mean, nobody can even understand it. This November, the voters of Wisconsin will not surrender their beloved state to the left wing mob, and that’s what would happen. In 78 days, we’re going to stop the radical left. We’re going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win four more years.
And then after that, we’ll go for another four years because you know what? They spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years. We caught them spying on the … Can you believe it? Did you see the FBI agent? He agreed. He’s pleading that he forged documents. Oh, that’s that’s good. No no. Wait until you see. It’s going to be incredible, but they spied on my campaign. They spied on our campaign. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. You can call it whatever you want. I use the word treason. They got caught. They got caught. The same people doing speeches on tape tonight. They got caught. So it’s too bad.

So, we have some great friends with us tonight. I want to thank representative Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much. And Jim Sensenbrenner is around here someplace. Thank you, Jim. Thanks, Jim. These guys are warriors. Also, a woman who did so great, she was so great in Michigan. She headed up Michigan. And a Republican hadn’t won Michigan in many, many years. And we got a lot of car companies building right now in Michigan. Don’t we? Ronna McDaniel, Ronna McDaniel. We won Michigan. I said, “Get me the woman that kept calling me in Michigan. You have to come one more time, sir.” I said, “This is it.” Then I’d leave and she’d call the next day. “One more time.” But you know, she did a great job. Thank you very much. Ronna’s fantastic. Head of the RNC.
 And the head of the Wisconsin Republican party, Chairman Andrew Hit. Andrew, wait, how are we doing, Andrew? Looking good. Beautiful kids, Andrew. Good. Good. I’m going to blame you, Andrew, if they don’t do it. Okay. I’ll fire you so fast Andrew. Andrew’s done a great job. Thank you. I think we are looking great here. We won it last time and you remember what a big shockwave because the Republican hadn’t won it for a long time and they were waiting for Pennsylvania and we won Pennsylvania and we had lost every vote. We would have won, but they didn’t want to call it. It got later and later and later, then Wisconsin came in and then Michigan came in and then Pennsylvania came in. By that time, we already had North Carolina. It’s hard for Republicans. You have to run the whole board, because they started off that we’re going to play for New York. With all of the crime in New York, I got to play for New York, because we did well in New York. We did well in New York, but we’re going to play for New York.

We’re going to play, I don’t know, guess we’ll do a little bit of a tiny shot maybe in California. They like me. And we’ll do a tiny little shot in Illinois. The other one we’re going to do, we’re going to go after New Jersey, we’re going to go after Virginia. We have a crazy governor of Virginia. He doesn’t want you to have guns and he doesn’t mind not only abortion, he doesn’t mind execution, because after birth, we’ll decide what to do with the baby, right? No, no. After. You hear this guy? First time I had heard of it. Scott, after birth, we will decide and we will discuss with the mother. And that’s the first time I’ve heard of it. This is the guy that likes to pretend he’s Michael Jackson, right? With the dancing. His wife saved a great embarrassment.

We have another great friend of mine. A great, great politician, but really, he’s much more than a politician. He’s an exceptional human being. He is tough. I had to go against him of those presidential primaries and I want to tell you, there’s nobody tougher, but he basically loves this state. I mean, he loves this state and he should be your governor right now. He should be. He’s an exceptional man. Scott Walker, governor Scott Walker. Thank you.

I’ll tell you one thing. He’s one of the most respected men. He goes into Washington, everybody stands up. They really do respect him a lot. And it’s really something. The next time you run, please don’t put marijuana on the ballot at the same time you’re running. You brought out like a million people that nobody ever knew were coming out, right? Because there was no way, but you can do whatever you want. You know that. You’re going to be successful, whatever you want to do. Thank you very much God for being here.

So, before the virus came in from China, unemployment in Wisconsin had reached the lowest rate ever recorded. Ever recorded. That was part of Scott’s thing too. I have to give him a little credit there, right? I have to do that. But we created 15,000 Wisconsin manufacturing jobs. Everybody said that would be impossible. 121, 000 Wisconsinites were lifted out of poverty and 100,000 were lifted off of food stamps because they had good jobs.

And we had created the single greatest economy in the history of the world. Our national economy was better than any economy that had ever happened before it. And China was having the worst year they had in 67 years. Not that I want that, but we took in billions of dollars. Nobody ever judged China for doing anything. What the money they took out of our country for so many years and the presidents that preceded me should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it to happen. And that includes sleepy Joe is part of that too.

But then we were hit by the virus and I had to close it up. I took the greatest economy and I closed it up and we saved millions of lives, as many lives. It shouldn’t have been one, but what you see today, you could multiply it times 10 or 15 or maybe even 20. It would have been a horrible … It would not have been sustainable, and now we’re bringing it back and we’ll bring it back so strongly. I took unprecedented action to save the U.S. economy and support Wisconsin families. Under our Paycheck Protection Program, we helped save over 1 million Wisconsin jobs. Earlier this month, I issued a directive granting emergency payroll tax relief to every worker making under $100,000 per year.

And this temporary relief will help tens of millions of American workers. That is something that people really … I’ll tell you, the great economists, that’s what they wanted. The payroll tax cut more than any other thing and it really applies. Number one, they open their business. It’s great for them, but really great for you, and it’s a big saving. It’s a lot of money in your pocket. If Republicans win in November, we will forgive these payments in full.

Thanks to my administration’s policies, we’re now witnessing the fastest … And you’ve seen this, right? The fastest economic recovery in the history of our country. Over the past three months, we have already gained much more than nine million jobs nationwide. That’s a record. That’s not even close by the way.

Nationwide, that’s a record. That’s not even close by the way. And you heard about the V, the V, the famous V and they said, “Well, maybe not a V. It’s got to be an M. It’s got to be an S. It’s got to be,” they have no clue. It’s turned out to be a super V because the numbers are much better. When you see the numbers coming, retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all time high. And auto production has surged 28%. And in leaving the great plane right behind me and we have a lot of televisions, we have televisions in closets. I was saying to another group, we have televisions on floors and ceilings. You can’t escape it. If you want to get away from Trump, you can’t be in that plane because … the fake news and Trump, they’re going to go out of business. When I do leave, in let’s say 16, 20 years, something like that. No, when we leave, they’re all out of business. I wouldn’t say that sleepy Joe would be very exciting to cover. I don’t think a lot of, “Let’s turn on the television, let’s watch what Biden’s saying today darling.”

But I just noticed on television that NASDAQ, that’s a big deal. NASDAQ hit an all time record today. The highest price ever, and the others are right behind it. I mean, who would think, we have a pandemic. I think we’re way on the other side of the pandemic, we’re doing great with vaccines and therapeutics and everything else, but regardless, we’re doing great with it, but who would think that we hit a record with NASDAQ and the others are right there. If you would have said we’re at 28,000 on the Dow, or just about and if you would have said NASDAQ hit a new record high, that’s great for your 401k’s.

Look, you get the wrong person in here, your 401k’s, wave goodbye to them. There’ll be worthless. There’ll be worthless. 401ks, that’s one of the things. A lot of people are bragging. About four months ago, they were very depressed. I said, “Don’t sell, don’t sell. Don’t worry about, don’t sell, forget about this.” And most people held and they’re very, very good. But husbands come up to me and wives come up to me. And one wife was saying, “Sir, I always thought my husband was a financial loser, a total loser.” He was this big good-looking policemen actually. And she said, “He’s never been good with money, but over the years, over the last few years, I think he was up 89%.” I said, “That’s not as good as most people.” She said, “No, no. My husband is a financial genius.” And this good looking policeman looked at me and said, “Thank you, sir, because I was abused for a long time about the way I invested money.”
 
And your 401ks are great. And your stocks are great. Then you see these big companies going up, that’s everybody, the stock market. That’s everybody. That’s just an indication. And they’re smart people. They know where it’s going. They have an instinct that’s better than most people. And they see what’s happening. Now with all of that, we have a headwind and the headwind is if for any reason we didn’t win, that stock market is going to go down like a rock goes through water. I hate to tell you folks, so good looking. If we didn’t have that headwind, your stocks would be even higher right now, even higher. So on election night, expect your 401k’s and your stocks to go very, very high. And I do believe we’re going to have a tremendous success. I do believe.

Again, the most enthusiasm that anybody has ever seen in any election is this one. The most enthusiasm. So we got to get out and vote. You got to be careful with your ballots. Be careful, your absentee ballots great. Your others, you got to be very careful or go to vote. Just go to vote. Go to vote. We have a little problem here. You have a Democrat governor who is will do anything to turn things around. How’s Tom Tiffany doing, by the way? Another win, we just had a nice win, right? Tom is around here someplace. Tom Tiffany just had a great win. We’re winning a lot. We’ve won a lot of House seats. We’re going to definitely, we’re going to take back the House. We’re going to take back the House.

As part of our great rebuilding the U.S. military we also signed a $5.5 billion contract to build combat ships in Marinette, Wisconsin, supporting thousands of jobs. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. We’ve spent $2.5 trillion, all made in the USA, all made in the USA. We have new fighter jets. We have new rockets. We’ve upgraded our nuclear, hope to God we never have to use it, but nobody’s even close. It was getting very tired. What we’ve done with our military is incredible with tanks. Speaking of tanks, we left our great tank, I was supposed to close down, we have a tank factory in Lima. Lima, Ohio, and it was scheduled to close. And I went to see it. And I said, “No way, we’re closing it because there’s no way we could ever reproduce that incredible,” and you know what happened? We didn’t close it. And we are buildings tanks like you wouldn’t believe. But what we’ve done with our military has been incredible.

And Biden has promised to slash our defense budget, destroying critical jobs. But more importantly, if we don’t have defense, everything we talk about is meaningless. We have to have defense. Defense of our country, especially when you look at what’s happening outside of our borders. So we have the greatest, right now when I took it over was totally depleted. It was gone. Right now, we have the greatest military we’ve ever had, the greatest equipment by far we’ve ever had. If Kamala and Biden are ever elected, this recovery will come to a total shutdown to use their word permanently. For no scientific reason. Biden wants to inflict dramatic harm on millions of Americans with his basement strategy, locking everyone in their homes.

You look at what’s happening with some of… And you got a dose of it right here, I hate to say, with some of these Democrat governors, they just don’t want to open it up. By the way, on November 4th, they’ll announce, “Well, we’ve decided to open.” November four. You got to get out to those polls. I’m serious. This is the most dangerous election we’ve ever had. The most dangerous, because I don’t think we can ever bring it back if they get in. I don’t think there’s anything called the comeback. It’ll be another Venezuela. I used to say that lightly. I now say it very strongly because it’s a similar ideology. This will be a large scale, very large scale, Venezuela if they win.

We’re going to win. My administration by contrast is following the science, applying common sense, mitigation, sheltering, you know this, we got a shelter. We got to take care. But what do we really have to do? We have to take care of our elderly people, our elderly people with heart problems, with diabetes, and we’re launching Operation Warp Speed to deliver effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine and therapeutics. More than 270 therapies are in clinical trials. Can you believe it? 270. And you’re going to be hearing some very good news very, very soon.

Now, we’re dealing with the deep state. So I’m watching it very closely. I don’t need to have them announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve found the vaccine, it’s perfect.” I don’t need that. And hopefully everyone’s looking to do the right thing. We want to get it out quickly, but we’re very close, both on therapy and on therapeutics and on vaccines. Advances in treatment have reduced the fatality rate in adults by 85% since April. Think of that. Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and we’re mass producing doses already of that vaccine because we think it works and we’re going to have it out very quickly. We will defeat the China virus. We will have the greatest economy that we’ve ever had next year, unless somebody wants to quadruple your taxes and the crazy things that they’re talking about, we will have next year, the single greatest economy we’ve ever had. So Biden’s been there for 47 years and he’s personally supported every globalist sellout of the last half century. He voted for NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals in history. For the China entry into the World Trade Organization, a total catastrophe. For Korea, the Korean deal was horrible. We renegotiated it. Now it’s a really great deal for us. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs disappeared almost overnight. Biden was strongly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would have destroyed our automobile manufacturing business. It would have been a disaster for our country. I ended it, but I approved the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately. The Keystone Pipeline, 48,000 jobs.

One of the great rip offs. It was done in my opinion, to hurt our country because we have so much energy. We’re now energy independent was I got out of this horrible Paris Climate Accord, which was a rip off on our country. It would have shipped millions of American jobs to China while allowing China to pollute with impunity. And they don’t even enter the agreement until 2030. So, it would have been a disaster. So many things are stacked against us. Even in the World Trade Organization, China is considered a developing nation. Therefore, they get tremendous, guess what? We don’t accept it. We’ve informed them, we don’t accept it. And we’re not approving any of those judges until such time as that ends.

So time and again, sleepy Joe Biden put China first and America last, even to a point where his son who had absolutely… Where’s Hunter, has anyone seen Hunter? He’s had absolutely no experience, walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage, that’s millions of dollars a year. And if you go to the pros of Wall Street, they’ll tell you it’s an impossibility. It was a 10 minute meeting. He walked away with one and a half billion from China. How do you think he’s going to do negotiating, Biden against China? Nobody’s done what I’ve done to China, to Russia. By the way, remember, we were going to be in a war with North Korea. What happened to the war? We’re getting along Kim Jong Un. We get along. Let’s see what happens. And meantime, it’s almost four years. Remember we were going to be in a war.

Look at all those people back, that’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Look at all the fake news. Isn’t that incredible. That’s a lot of fake news back there, Scott. At the end of Joe Biden’s eight years as vice president, nearly 2 million Americans of prime working age had dropped out of the workforce. Our factories were stolen. Our country was doing lousy. He lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. He was, by the way, a disaster on swine flu. He got a horrible rating in Gallup. Look at the Gallup poll. So they call it H1N1 right? You remember? H1 swine flu, H1N1. He calls it N1H1, but I don’t hold them in that one. That’s one of the small mistake. The bigger mistakes is what he says He’s at a different state when he’s speaking. “Great to be in the great state of Ohio,” but no, no, no, we’re not in Ohio.

You know what you know what you do when that happens? You just walk off because there’s nothing you can do to recover. It’s happened to him like what, six times? Almost every time. That’s why he doesn’t talk. He’s shot, he’s shot. We got to say, look, one thing I’ve learned Putin, President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un, Erdogan of Turkey. They are world-class chess players. We can’t have a guy who’s shot and in his best years wasn’t very good. He wasn’t very good. We can’t have, these guys are world-class chess players.

They’re all dreaming of Joe Biden. I’ll tell you who’s dreaming about them is Iran. If we win, and when we win, we are going to have a deal with Iran immediately. They’re just waiting, hoping that Biden gets in. Hoping John Kerry is saying, “Oh, he should have…” He, by the way, if anybody violated the Logan Act, it was John Kerry. John Kerry, not General Flynn. John Kerry.

The cost of health insurance for American families had skyrocketed under Obama and Biden by $4,800 and nearly 11 million more Americans were on food stamps. So Biden’s abysmal record, but you do have to check swine flu because that was peanuts compared to this monster. This monster is the worst thing that’s happened in this world since 1917. Where it could have been a hundred million people died. Swine flu though, look at his ratings in Gallup, check them out. They gave them really bad ratings, Joe Biden. Not that that matters, but that does matter. When a guy is critical and we’ve done an incredible job, including among the best numbers in the world, Joe Biden’s abysmal record-

Among the best numbers in the world, Joe Biden’s abysmal record of failure and betrayal ended the day I took the oath of office. We got our people back working. We made real deals with foreign countries.

I told Japan prime minister, Robbie, great guy, but I said, “Prime minister, you have to build places in Michigan. You have to build your places in other areas of our country. It’s not fair. We have a big deficit. Go to Wisconsin, go to Ohio, go to these places.” He said he’s going to do it. Many, many Japanese plants now are being built all over our country. Somebody had to ask him to do it. Somebody had to tell them to do it. It’s not fair. And it was all happening. Then it came in, now it’s going out, watch what’s going to happen. Watch how good the third quarter is. The third quarter is coming up right before the election. Watch how good Scott Walker … even you will be impressed by those numbers, even Scott.

But we passed massive tax cuts. We passed massive regulation cuts, and you know what? You might not feel this, maybe the most important thing I did for making the economy great wasn’t just the tax cuts, it was the regulation cuts because the regulation cuts allowed companies to go out and build projects that they couldn’t get approved for 15 years and 20 years. Big deal.

We replaced probably the worst trade deal ever NAFTA with the brand new USMCA, which puts us right at the top. And now Canada and Mexico are doing what’s right for our country. It’s been a great deal. And when the Wisconsin timber industry was being threatened by administration, took immediate action. We imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products, saving countless timber jobs all across your state, and you know exactly what I’m talking about. You were taken advantage of by stupid US policy. Canada was taking advantage of this country. Not anymore. If Biden and the crew get in, the radical left will bring timber production to a total halt. I stood up to China’s decades of trading abuses. And when China targeted our farmers, we provided $28 billion in relief, we gave our farmers. I said to Secretary Perdue, secretary of agriculture, “Sonny, how much they’ve targeted our farmers. How much have they been targeted for? ” Sir, two years ago it was 12 billion, last year it was 16 billion, 28 billion total.” I said, “Guess what? We’re charging tariffs of $28 billion to China.” We charged so much more and we gave 12 billion, and 16 and 28. We gave … any farmers in here, any farmers? Did I do a good job for you, please? I don’t hear any farmers complaining. Am I right? We did a good job.

I’ll tell you what, with a more typical president … I want to be nice, more typical, every farmer would be out of business right now, but we gave 28 billion to the farmers think of that. And the farmers are doing well. And then we signed a deal with China. And I was very excited because I had a very good relationship with President Xi. We signed a great deal. And under the deal, they would buy $240 billion, 50 billion of farm product and then manufacturing. Once the China flu came in, once the China stuff came in, I was not … really, I wasn’t, I couldn’t, it was different. But I have to tell you, four days ago, the corn order was the largest corn order in the history of ordering corn.

It was the biggest China ordered two days. The biggest order in the history of corn. Then they did, if you look at soybeans, it was the largest soybean order in history, in history, and also beef cattle, et cetera. So it just shows you how smart China is. We sign a deal and the plague comes in. It might’ve been a mistake. It might’ve been on purpose. Who knows what happened? We’ll figure it out. But whatever it was, it was no good. They could have stopped it. But they know my attitude, I don’t like it. I don’t like it. So a normal country that’s not so smart in that position, Scott would have said, “Oh, we don’t like the way he’s talking about us. Let’s immediately shut down.” He didn’t do that. They said, “Let’s order more from the farmers than we’ve ever ordered. Biggest corn, biggest soybean, biggest cattle.”

And now I’m getting my farmers saying, “Sir, we’re starting to like China.” I said, “You know what? We got to be very careful. Do you understand that?” So what they’ve done is they’ve gone out, they’ve made massive orders. So think how smart that is. 99% of people in that position would say, “Well, we’re not going to order anymore.” They say, “Let’s order so much that they become almost reliant on us.” Very smart, very, very smart. America has spent nearly four years cleaning up the mess we inherited from Joe Biden’s 47 year worth of disaster.

It’s incredible. He’s in there for 47 years, he does nothing. Now all of a sudden, he’s going to do all these things. He’s going to get tough on China. Sure. China will own the United States if we don’t make this deal and we will [ 00:51:00] if we don’t get elected, China will own the … mark by word. Well, I hope you’re not going to be able to test it out. China will own the United States. Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama. They got $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash, green cash for nothing. We got nothing out of that deal. And I terminated that deal. I terminated that deal. And we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That’s for the evangelicals. It’s amazing with that. The evangelicals are more excited about that than Jewish people. It’s incredible. But we did, we did that. And Golan Heights, don’t forget Golan Heights. We did Golan Heights. So we’ve done a lot. In February, Biden said, “If you elect me your taxes are going to be raised. They’re not going to be cut.” Now [ 00:07:05], how the hell do you do this? That will [ 00:07:09]. Only in this state can we get away with it, but you happen to be right. You happen to be right. So I just want to say this. This has been an incredible experience for me getting to know you. I’ve been here a lot. We won this state. We weren’t expected to win this state.

We’ve been great for each other. We’ve been great for each other. It’s a partnership in a sense, but we’ve been great for each other. We brought a lot of business to this state. We’re bringing a lot more business to this state, whether it’s the ships, or the crops or any one of so many different things, especially maybe the trade deal with Canada and Mexico, because of Wisconsin and your specialized milk, a small subject, but the right farmers got me at the right time and they said, “Wow, you guys are really being taken advantage of with Canada charging you 287% tariff.” I think you mostly know about that. But unless you were up here a lot like I was, you’d never find that out. And I worked with Scott and I worked with others and we solved all of these problems. We solved all of them, Scott, right? This is the most important election we ever had. We’ve got to stop these radical left maniacs. We’ve got to win this election. We have many things to do. We want to finish it up. It’s no different. You plant a tree, it takes a little time to grab on. In addition, we have other things we’re going to do. More regulation cutting, even more tax cutting. We’re going to be doing very substantial tax cuts because that’s an incentive toward growth and we’re going to do it. And we prove to be right. We prove to be 100% right. We’re not letting them raise your taxes on you and destroy everything that we’ve done. So I just want to thank the incredible people of Wisconsin.

You really are. You really are. You’re a state that despite everything, everything that they were saying, “Well, Wisconsin, can’t be one.” Guess what? And I think we’re way far ahead. I do believe we’re way far ahead. Where we were, if you look back four years, I think we have much more spirit. You see, this as easier in a sense. Now, the virus made it a little bit more difficult, maybe a lot more difficult because all of a sudden, something happened that nobody ever even thought about, but we handled it. We handled it and we handled it well. And we’re now helping other countries with the ventilators and other things. But the easier part is, I used to come up as a businessman. I was very successful. And I’d say, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to do tax cuts. We’re going to …”

Even Space Force, I never even talked about Space Force, but we did more … somebody said we actually did more than we promised. That’s never happened with a politician before. We did actually more, but I never talked about Space Force. And then I got into office. I said, “We need that.” Because you look at what China’s doing, what Russia’s doing, what others are looking at. So we have Space Force first time in 78 years since the air force that that’s happened, full scale, so it’s great, and you’re a big beneficiary of that as you know. So we have to win the election. We can’t play games. Get out and vote. Do those a beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted. Make sure because the only way we’re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged, remember that. It’s the only way we’re going to lose this election.

So we have to be very careful. Look, we have more than this election, that’s a big statement. The only way they’re going to win is that way. And we can’t let that happen. And our post office, we’re going to make our post office great. It’s been a disaster for many years. We’re going to take care of the men and women in the post office and we’re going to make it great. Right now it’s a laughingstock. Amazon and these companies come and they drop all of their packages into the post office. And the post office loses just hundreds of billions of dollars delivering these packages. Let them deliver it or let them pay the right price. So that’s it. But we’re going to make our post office strong. We’re going to make our post office really strong and really great.

We’re going to be proud of it again. It lost $78 billion in a short period of time over the last 12 or 13 years, $78 billion. We want to make our post office strong. We want to be proud of it. I want to thank you very much. You’ve been my friends, my true friends. We will win and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.",17/8/20
"
Well, thank you very much, Minnesota. There was supposed to only have like a hundred people. You know, we’re supposed to have these tiny little crowds. You can’t have any more than that. It’s very heavily restricted. That’s a lot of people showed up. I want to thank you. We’d love to have those rallies, but I guess you just can’t do that. And you’re not allowed to do that now. So we don’t do that, but we do the little airport hops and people like them and a lot of people come back. But unfortunately we had to hold off a lot of people in the back, which I feel badly about. In 78 days, we’re going to be. 78 days. We’re going to win this state. We’re going to take back the White House and we’re going to have an election that’s all about the survival, our nation.

This is a very important, in my opinion, I used to say 2016. And I must tell you, I think this is going to be the most important election in the history of our country. This is a very, very big deal going on. Joe Biden is the puppet of left wing extremists, trying to erase our borders, eliminate our police, indoctrinate our children, vilify our heroes, take away our energy. You know all about that. Take away our energy. If you can believe it. No fossil fuel. Destroy our second amendment, attack the right to life and replace American freedom with left wing fascism. Left wing. We’re going to left wing all the way. Fascists. They are fascists. Some of them, not all of them, but some of them, but they’re getting closer and closer. We have to win this election, but the proud people of Minnesota will not let this happen.

You will deliver a historic victory for our values, our citizens and our treasured way of life. We’ll save our cities in our suburbs from the future of crime and chaos, corruption, and economic collapse that puppet Joe Biden would unleash on America. This is a puppet. He won’t do it intentionally. He just says, “Well, whatever they want.” Because he has no clue. He has no clue.

I ended low income housing being built in the suburbs and destroying people’s American dream. You know that. If Biden and Harris get into power, they’ve pledged to raise your taxes by $4 trillion, which put in very simple terms, mean many of you will have to pay double and triple the taxes that you’re paying right now. This includes attacks of over $3,000 on a typical family of four. Biden Harris also pledged to eliminate fracking, natural gas, oil, and coal production. Forcing us to beg for energy from foreign suppliers. On my watch, America will proudly remain energy independent. First time, energy independent. We’ve met a lot of progress on energy.

I want to thank your terrific representatives in Congress, Tom Emmer. Where’s Tom? Tom, Tom, Tom.
There he is, what a man. These are warriors. Jim Hagedorn. Pete Stauber.

And this is a very important one, fellows. This is very important. Your next senator from Minnesota. Fantastic man. I just see that he’s even in the poll. Normally that doesn’t mean much, but that’s a big step and he’s fantastic. Jason Lewis, he’s going to be a fantastic senator. That’s big, Jason. That’s ahead of schedule. And I hear we’re doing very well in the poll too. We win Minnesota, it is over. It is over, right? We win Minnesota. But our great Republican candidates for Congress, Michelle Fischbach. Where’s Michelle? Michelle? I hear so many great things about you. I have heard so many great things. Go out and do it. You’re going to do it. We’re going to be out there working with you. Tyler Kistner. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Good luck, Tyler.

It’s a great group. And man whose name I love, Lacy Johnson. Great job. I’ve been following you, Lacy. You’re doing good. You’re doing good. Thank you, Lacy very much. We really have to get them. They’re warriors, all of them, all of them. We have to get them in because we have to stop this craziness that’s going on. No law enforcement, no anything. They don’t know what they’re doing. They’ll lose the country. You know, there’s somebody said the other day and I say it very strongly, “Sir, you’re the only one between that and the greatness of the American dream.” And there’s truth to it. We don’t stop. We don’t keep this position. We’re going to win the House. I feel confident we’re going to win the House.

We are going to win the House. I’m very much involved in every single race and with the Senate, we’re working very hard. I think we’re going to be in great shape in the Senate. And I think we’re a great, did you see that CNN, they raised us 10 points in one poll that took place over a short period of time? And it’s still not good enough. It’s still not good enough. You mean they’re getting more honest because I’ll tell you what, there’s never been enthusiasm like we have. There’s never been. Right, Tom? Including in 2016, we’ve never had. We had more enthusiasm than anyone’s seen maybe ever in a presidential campaign and it pales in comparison to what’s going on right now. It does.

Even this, we wanted to restrict the crowd. We didn’t tell anybody and look at what happens. But look at Voters for Trump. Look at Bikers for Trump. They have highways with thousands of people, thousands of people, right? You know, bikers going, I don’t know if I’m driving along and I get passed by 2,000 bikers, I don’t know what I’m going to do. And then they have, they set Guinness book, I hear, the world record yesterday for boats. But no matter where you… In Florida, no matter where you go, a river, a lake, an ocean, there’re boats up there by the thousands on the wicker. The weekend is unbelievable. Minnesota Senate majority leader, Paul Gazelka. Paul. Thank you, Paul. Good job, Paul. Are we doing good? We’re doing good. Right? I think we are too. And Minnesota House Republican leader. Another great one. Kurt Daudt. Kurt, thank you very much. Thank you, Kurt, very much.

I’m having a lot of fun today because it’s so windy. You can’t see these teleprompters at all. So I’m sort of making it up as I go along and that’s okay. I’ve had to do that plenty. Now these suckers are blowing, like I’m saying “What that hell?” Fortunately, I know these people. If I didn’t know these people, you would have been in big trouble. I will tell you that. Another one I know very well, he’s the single greatest ad buyer in the history of the world. And he also happens to make a very good product. His pillow. I use it. When I sleep well, I’m using his pillow and these suckers are about to fall down, but that’s okay because I know him very well. Mike Lindell.

Mike, thank you. And he’s the chairman of our campaign. If I don’t win Minnesota with you as the chairman of our campaign, I would say that would be very bad for me because if this guy can do anything, thank you, Mike. It’s an honor and we appreciate it very much. Thank you. You do a great job. Thank you. And it’s all made in Minnesota, right? All made in Minnesota. Thank you very much. Before the China virus invaded our shores, we built the greatest economy in history. There was nothing like it. We were beating everybody, including China. They had the worst year in 67 years. We were taking in billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. Beautiful thing tariffs, when used properly, especially when you’re being taken advantage of by every nation of the world. We achieved record low unemployment for African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, young people, people with diplomas, people without diplomas, college students, crummy students, great students, horrible students, dumb people, liberal people, conservative people.

Everybody was doing the best they’ve ever done. PhDs from MIT. PhDs from crummy colleges. Everybody was doing the greatest, the best they’ve ever done. Median household income soared to the highest level ever recorded. Numbers were unbelievable to open new opportunities for Minnesota farmers and factory workers. We replaced the disaster known as NAFTA with a brand new USMCA, which has been a big hit. Dairy exports to Canada are now expected to surge by at least 50%. I know how good the deal is. Don’t tell Canada I said this because they were not happy about it. They had pickets. When they have pickets about a deal, that makes you feel good. But they’ve been taking advantage. You know, Canada. Oh, Canada. Wonderful song. Right? Oh, Canada. Nice, nice song. Only one problem. They took advantage of us like crazy with your dairy tariffs, 297% tariff on your dairy products, right?

I learned that when I came up here, they had specialty milk, a little thing, specialty milk. And I met a farmer and he said what had happened with specialty milk. And that got me over the edge. And I said, “We got to change this,” because you were taken, Tom. You were taken advantage of by Canada very badly and by Mexico and by China and by Japan and by friends and foe. And in many cases, friends who are worse than the foe. For years, you watched as politicians like Sleepy Joe Biden who’s been in office for 47 years, allowed foreign nations to crush Minnesota’s mining. Look at your mining industry, it was crushed by dumping tons and tons of cheap iron and steel into our country. I saw what was happening. I did something about it. I did something about it.

I will tell you, China wants me to lose so badly. They all do. They all do. And yet I get along with all of them. Although China I don’t speak to them. After the plague came in, you know, we made a great deal with China. They announced last week that China ordered the largest amount of corn in history and the largest amount of soybeans in history and big cattle purchases. One of the biggest anybody has seen. And I said, “See how smart they are? If they weren’t smart, they would’ve stopped and we would’ve said let’s decouple.” But by ordering so much, the farmers come to me, “Sir, we like this deal a lot. Please don’t do anything irrational.”

How smart is China? Right? The biggest corn order. Think. They said the biggest corn order in history. So I have to say, “Ah.” But I tell you, my view has changed a lot. We’ve made a great deal with China, but my view has changed a lot. USMCA is the biggest deal ever made. And that one is working out great between Canada and Mexico. And remember this, Minnesota, under the last administration, the last administration, Minnesota iron range was wiped out. Seven plants were idled and more than 2,000 workers were laid off. Obama and Biden closed it down. Do you remember that? The finest iron ore in the world, they say, I don’t know, what do I know? To me it all looks the same, but they say it’s the finest iron ore in the world. That’s good enough for me. And what did I do? Almost immediately after getting into office, I heard about this disaster, just like Keystone Pipeline, just like so much else, Jason. And you’ll be working on that with me and in the beautiful halls of the Senate. And he’s going to stay with us. He’s not going to be one of those that gets elected.

He’s not going to be one of them that get elected and then he walks into those gorgeous buildings when they had those big, beautiful dollar bills and they built marble columns. And it’s so beautiful. And so rich, he’s not going to say, “Darling, we finally arrived. Now we can go with majority.” He’s going to do what’s right. He’s going to do what’s right. I know Jason, you need Jason, get Jason elected please. But they closed it up. And I was here and a worker. I was making speeches before you had to stand 200 feet away from everybody, before you had to stand like two football fields away. And a worker came up to me with a group of his friends and they were all crying and they were tough. They never cried before in their life. Maybe when they were babies but I doubt it.

They were all crying. He said, “Sir, you gave us back our life.” He said that. I had that just recently in Maine, they took away 5,000 square miles. Think of a square mile and then multiply it times 5,000. Took away 5,000 square miles. That was, O-Biden. As I call them, O-Biden. That was Obama and Biden short. I like that term. O-Biden, because you save a lot of time, but that was Obama and Biden in Maine took away 5,000, Mike, square miles. You know what that is? That’s like I said, “Let me see what it looks like on a map.” They basically took away the Atlantic ocean from Maine. And Maine is the greatest in the world for lobster and the greatest in the world, just about, for fishing. I said, “Why did he take this area?”

They didn’t know, except that was the great fishing area. And I gave it back to them. I redid it. I took it off. I wiped it out. I gave an executive order that wiped it out immediately. Then we wiped out the tariffs that they were being charged by China. And by, as you know, the United Kingdom was charging tariffs. They were all charging tariffs to our fishermen, but we don’t charge tariffs to them. So I made it. I made it fair. European Union was a disaster charging tariffs. They were charging big tariffs. We wouldn’t. So here’s what was happening. So Canada, they would sell the fish and lobster to Canada for nothing, for peanuts and Canada would then sell it to China and also to the European Union, because Canada had a deal where they didn’t have to pay the tariffs. This was before my time, how this could’ve happened is a…

They didn’t have to pay the tariffs. This was before my time. How this could have happened is incredible. So I said, “Listen, if you don’t change your tariffs, I’m going to put your tariffs on your car.” It was amazing. They said, “We’ll change them immediately.” Thank you very much. That took about two minutes. So I did a lot for Maine. We’re going to see whether or not they remember but I think Maine’s going to remember but I did similar for you when I opened up your great iron ore and I put tariffs, I put tariffs on foreign steel and the Iron Range came roaring back to life. You know that, right? Right?

These guys came up to me, “You’ve given us back our life.” I’ve never forgotten that, “You’ve given us back our life.” They didn’t say thanks, they didn’t say thanks for the job, they said that’s what they’ve done all their life and Obama just came in and closed it up. I don’t say Biden because I don’t think he knows what the hell is happening. I think if you mention … IF you mention, “You shouldn’t have done that to Minnesota,” he’ll say, “Where’s Minnesota? [ 00:16:58]. I don’t know what Minnesota is. Where is that please?”

How many times by the way has he been up at a speech where he’ll say the wrong state, right? He’ll get up, “It’s great to be in the wonderful state of Ohio.” “Sir, sir, you’re in Florida.” That’s the bad one, when you see palm trees. Wonderful to be in Ohio. Or, “I love being with the people from Iowa.” “Sir, you’re in Idaho.” He always gets New Hampshire mixed up with Vermont. But all the time he does that. I haven’t done it yet. If I do I’m just leaving because there’s no way you can save it. There’s no way you can save it.

We recently issued a directive protecting workers on the Iron Range from unfair job-killing regulation and frivolous litigation in addition to everything else. We started construction on the new soo lock, right? Soo lock, big deal. That’s been deteriorating for many years. Just about gone and we’re redoing it now, rebuilding it. That’s a big deal for your state and for others so that the iron ore can quickly get to market. Soo lock. Our miners are back on the job and wages have increased by as much as 50% and they’re doing great even during the China plague, they’re doing great and the China plague will fade but we will not forget. If Biden wins, the Iron Range will be shut down forever. You know that. He’ll shut it down very early on forever. I took a lot of heat by doing that. I took a lot of heat from the so-called environmentalists. I’m an environmentalist too in a big sense. We just signed something the every day. Cory Gardner, Steve Daines, senators, great senators, and we signed a bill that’s going to really be something incredible from an environmental standpoint, the biggest we’ve ever signed they say, other than Teddy Roosevelt. It goes back to Teddy Roosevelt. I said, “Why is [ 00:19:09]?” Because we also did something tremendous for Utah, you know that. Thousands and thousands of acres, we opened it up. I said, “Why isn’t it bigger than Teddy Roosevelt? I want bigger. Otherwise I’m not signing,” they said, “Sir, he did the Grand Canyon and a few other things.” I said, “All right. That’s pretty big.” Grand Canyon is big. Do we agree? Even from Mike Lindell, the Grand Canyon. Even Mike would admit the Grand Canyon’s tough to beat, right? So anyway, but we did. We signed it and it’s one of the biggest acts. They say the biggest thing environmentally done since Teddy Roosevelt. That’s a long time ago.

We achieved together and what we’re doing together is nothing short of an economic miracle and now we’re doing it again. We did it, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now I have to do it again. You know what that is? That’s right, that’s God testing me. He said, “You know, you did it once,” and I said, “Did I do a great job, God? I’m the only one that could do it?” He said, “That you shouldn’t say. Now we’re going to have you do it again.” I said, “Okay, I agree. You got me.” But I did it once and now I’m doing it again and you see the kind of numbers that we’re putting up, they’re unbelievable. Best job numbers ever, three months, more jobs in the last three months than ever before. Best retail sales in history. Best car sales, did you see where the car sales are actually above what they were? Did you see the manufacturing, remember you’re not going to have manufacturing back. You needed a magic wand for manufacturing, well we got the magic wand because the manufacturing numbers are through the roof and your state, last year had the best year it ever had, right? Best year it ever had and now you’re going to have something that’s even better. So I just want to tell you, we are going to do it again.

By the way, third quarter numbers come out and interestingly they will come out just before November 1 and we’re going to see how I did but I think you’re going to have a great third quarter. People are now starting to predict it much to their chagrin, right? Much to their chagrin. [ 00:21:20] just like CNN said, “He’s up 10 points.” They all said, “10 points? 10 points?” First of all, the first poll was rigged and wrong. It was a rigged poll, just like they want to try and rig the election with all these mail-in ballots. Let’s send out 62 million ballots. Let’s send … Well, some people say, “Gee, you shouldn’t talk.” I got to talk about it because absentee ballots are good. You send for the ballot, you’re not going to be in your state and you get it back and you do something and you send it back in and it’s a process. You have to work for it a little bit. But these ballots, they want to send them out in some states, they want to send them out and they want to just have millions of ballots, they say, “Oh, we drop them in a lockbox.”
I just saw, the great thing about Air Force One, there’s no lack of television. You have televisions on the ceilings, in the closets, on the floors. No matter where you go, there’s a television. You open the closet, there’s a television. I say, “No, too much Trump. I can’t watch it anymore.” I try and get away, you put yourself in a closet. But they have a lot of stuff and they showed this person getting on FOX, you know FOX now puts on more Democrats just about than they do Republicans. They have certainly changed a lot. FOX has changed a lot. They’re probably turning off right now as I speak but I don’t … See I don’t care. I tell the truth. It’s ridiculous.

One of the biggest differences between this year and four years ago is FOX. FOX is like from a different planet, and too bad. And you know what’s going to happen? If we don’t win, they’re going to go down the tubes along with every other media outlet, they’ll all be bust, they’ll all be gone, I can tell you that. Nobody’s going to want to cover Sleepy Joe. We’ll end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell, but when you look at it and when you look at what’s happening, that’s why we have to win this election, and if we don’t win this election, every one of you, me, all of us, it will never be the country … I don’t think the country can ever come back to it.

I used to use Venezuela a lot. I don’t know if I even really fully believed it but I’d say, “Venezuela, we would indeed become.” When I look at these maniacs in Portland, these anarchists in Portland, when I look at these people, that’s what they want for the rest of the country. They want to defund their police, they want to terminate their police. You know something about that. You’ve had your little stance where they want to … Did they actually do the, they actually are terminating the police department, right? They are actually doing it. They’re not even talking about it, they’re terminating the police department. These people are crazy, and by the way, when I sent in the National Guard, that’s when it all stopped and I kept calling. I kept calling and saying, “Send in the National Guard. Send in the National Guard.” They should have done it a lot sooner.

That was a beautiful … I just said, I just stopped some place else and I said, “To me it was a beautiful sight.” They were rioting all over, full of venom, vigor. They thought nobody was going to stop them. The police department is very good but they were told you can’t do anything. They have to be able to do what they do very well. So they were told they couldn’t do anything and the city was ablaze. It was ablaze. I’ll never forget the CNN reporter, he’s standing there with his very nice shaved head. Right now I wish I had a shaved head, it would be a good [ 00:24:55] wind, but you know what? He’s standing there, [Velshi 00:24:59], right? Ali Velshi, and he’s standing there, “Things seem quite calm right now,” and behind him, they have the entire city looks like it’s burning down for blocks. He’s standing there talking because the fake news doesn’t report the truth and they don’t talk about how serious it is and how bad it is.

But remember this, it’s only a small part of our country. It’s not a big part, very small but they don’t report the facts because they don’t want to report those facts because those facts are very bad for Joe Biden and for the radical left and they want them to win. For whatever reason I don’t know because they’ll all lose their networks, they’ll all lose their wealth, everything will be gone but they’ll figure it out someday but we’re not going to let them have that chance. As much as in many ways they should not be rewarded, they’re going to be rewarded if I win because our country is only going up in one direction so that’s the way it is.
 
To fight the China virus, we’ve enacted the largest financial relief package in American history, through the Paycheck Protection Program we saved one million Minnesota jobs. We’ve also delivered nearly five billion dollars in economic relief straight to Minnesota families, you know that, we’ve kept it all going, and we’d like to do it again, except the Democrats, all they want is one trillion dollars, one trillion. They’re not interested in the people, they’re not interested in the Post Office. It’s all a ruse, it’s all a con. They’re only interested in getting a trillion dollars, you guys know that, getting a trillion dollars for states that are badly run blue states, very badly run by governors and mayors like New York, Illinois, California, I won’t name any more because to be honest, he’s going, “Minnesota, I don’t know.” I don’t like to be so personal but you do have some issues, I will say that. Of all places I would be very surprised, I was very surprised.

Unlike Sleepy Joe Biden our approach to the pandemic is based on science, not left-wing ideology. Slow Joe opposed the travel ban on China that I instituted. Remember he came out, “Oh it’s xenophobic.” I said, “What does that mean Joe? Tell me Joe. Can you describe?” Remember he came out and he called me all sorts of things, a racist and everything and then he said I was right. I was early, way, way early. We would have lost hundreds of thousands of additional lives and that’s pretty much agreed by everybody. Then I put the ban on Europe coming in because they were ahead of us and when I looked at Italy and I looked at France and Spain I said, “We got to put it on,” and a lot of people didn’t want that, they said we were right about that, and then we started getting into the manufacturing business with the ventilators and all of the equipment and what we did is incredible. The governors were not prepared. We made a lot of governors look good by supplying massive amounts of equipment. Massive. Not one person in this country, we didn’t have very many ventilators at all. Way under-supplied. Not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn’t get the ventilators so every single person that needed one got one which is pretty amazing.

We have a big country with a lot of diversity, a lot of different states, and now we’re supplying, we’re making thousands of ventilators a month and we’re supplying them to the rest of the word because they’re not equipped to make a ventilator. It’s very complex, very expensive. We’re making thousands a month, we have all we can use.

Now Biden wants to lock all Americans in their basement for months on end which would inflict permanent irreversible harm on our nation’s children, families, health and economy. By contrast my administration is following data-driven and science-based approaches that apply to common sense mitigation, aggressively sheltering those at greatest risk, our seniors, we have to shelter them, and deliver effective medical treatments to save thousands and thousands of lives and when you look at the rest of the world, you know they were trying to say, “Oh, we weren’t doing that.” Now all of a sudden a lot of the places that they were using to hold up, they’re having a big surge, and I don’t want that, I don’t want that, but they were holding up names of countries and now they’re saying, “Whoops.” In fact, even New Zealand, you see what’s going on in New Zealand? They beat it, they beat it. It was like front page, they beat it because they wanted to show me something. The problem is, big surge in New Zealand. So you know, it’s terrible. We don’t want that but this is an invisible enemy that should have never been let to come to this country, to Europe or the rest of the world by China. Just remember it. Just remember it. [ 00:29:46]

The fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by 85% since April. We’ve learned, we know, we have some great things now too. Europe by contrast has experienced a 40% higher rate of excess mortality than the United States. Think about that, you don’t hear those stories, they don’t tell you that Tom, do they? You don’t hear that in Congress, right? We launched the largest mobilization of American goods since the World War II. Think of it, since World War II. This is the largest mobilization since World War II, creating the most advanced testing system in the world, producing thousands of ventilators and launching Operation Warp Speed to deliver and distribute a vaccine before the end of the year in record time. We’re at a very, very close point to the vaccine and to therapeutics and therapeutics to me are more important right now. You go into the hospital, whether it’s a transfusion or whether it’s a shot and you feel better two days later or a day later or three days later but now would be a great thing and we’re very close, we have great, great companies working on it.

Because we will defeat the China virus, we’re going to be stronger than we ever were. Next year is going to be record setting numbers and you see that when you look at the V. The V is turning out to be true. I was saying a V and everybody was saying a V is impossible but the V, it’s beyond a V, it’s a super V based on the numbers that we have now. So we’ll see what happens and we would like to give additional money to people. We would like to … It wasn’t their fault that they got hit by China but you know what? We want to give them additional money and we’ll take care of … Again, the Post Office has been a disaster for many, many decades. We want to strengthen the Post Office, make it good. It lost $78 billion over a relatively short number of years. $78 billion, I want to strengthen the Post Office and we can do it so that if you look, Amazon and all these companies that now do, it’s a whole new business, they just drop a lot of it right into the Post Office and we lose two and three –

… just drop a lot of it right into the post office, and we lose two and $3 every time we deliver a package. What’s that all about? And he gets richer, and they get richer. How smart is that? For every package they deliver, it’s two and $3 a package. So why aren’t they raising the prices to Amazon and to these companies that are making all this money? Instead, we pay for it, and they always seem to open their distribution facilities right next to a post office.

So they take a lot of the goods that they can’t distribute, because the post office is massive, much bigger than those companies, believe it or not, you wouldn’t think it, but much, much bigger. And they go to areas of Minnesota, and other states that you can’t reach, you’ll never reach, and they just dump thousands of packages into the post office and they say, “Good luck. Here’s your $2. Here’s your $1. Here’s your 52 cents.” Now we got to do that. So that’s my opinion. What do I know about delivery? What do I know? That’s my opinion. That’s a new business, but we’re being taken advantage of by all of those companies, and they should pay, not the people.

My administration also understands that economic health is vital to public health. Over the past three months, we’ve gained nine million jobs nationwide, which is a new record. Retail spending is fully recovered and is now at an all-time high. We have more retail spending now than we did before the plague came in from China. Auto-production surge, 28%. Joe Biden would crush this unprecedented economic recovery. During his 47 years in Washington, think of that, 47 years, Joe Biden. And it’s really amazing, for 47 years, he did nothing, now he’s telling everybody how he’s going to make it wonderful, right? It doesn’t work that way, and he’s not exactly prime time now either, by the way.

Joe Biden supported every globalist attack on the American worker, NAFTA, which was a disaster, TPP, which I didn’t allow to happen, the horrible Korea deal. South China’s entry into the World Trade Organization might’ve been the worst of them all, it created China. Now Biden is running on the most extreme far-left agenda ever put forward by a major party. Biden’s joint manifesto, we call it a manifesto, with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, would raise taxes and increase regulations at an unprecedented rate. He will kill the stock market, he will kill everything that we’re talking about today. He’d also abolish immigration enforcement, abolish bail, abolish the suburbs, abolish effective policing, abolish American energy, and abolish the American way of life, otherwise, he’d do quite a good job, I think.

He raised his hand and pledged to give free healthcare to illegal aliens, okay? A lot of you people, you don’t get free healthcare, but he wants to give it. He wants to give lawyers, free legal assistance to people that come into our country illegally, and his vice-presidential candidate, Biden picked Kamala, Kamala Harris. She’s [ 00:03:22], she’s a beauty, who co-sponsored a $32 trillion socialist takeover of healthcare and our country, because our country would be ruined, destroyed. And think of this, you have 33 in healthcare and $93 trillion on the socialist Green New Deal, which doesn’t work. It’s like written by a child. It’s written by a child, a foolish child. It’s written by a foolish child.

I have a very different vision for America’s future, you got to see it before the plague, but you’re seeing it again right now, even more so. It starts with creating 10 million jobs in the next 10 months, and that’s what’s happening. Over the next four years, we will cut even more taxes, substantially, and regulations. That’s why people are pouring into our country to open up factories, they’re bringing them back to Minnesota and every place else. In Michigan, we have auto plants opening up left and right, and expanding. They haven’t seen that in 42 years. We will end our reliance on China. We will make our critical drugs and supplies right here in the United States.

And when you see the drug companies, they’re very rich, very sophisticated, when you see them taking the ads against Donald Trump, those ads are for one reason, because I’m bringing your drug prices way down, I instituted a favored nations clause. So if Germany, or any place, anywhere in the world is getting their drugs for less, which they do, a tiny fraction of what we pay, they have to meet those prices. Somebody should’ve done this. Obama, Biden, other presidents should’ve done this. Our drug prices are many times higher than other countries. Many, many times. In Canada, the price is half and better than that, and I gave Florida, Ron DeSantis, a great governor, gave him the right to buy his drugs directly from Canada. He’s going to save half. So right now you can’t do that. I gave him and I gave another state, Colorado, the authority to, if they want, they could go buy, prior to the favored nations kicking in.

But the favored nations clause could reduce drugs by 50, 60, 70, even 80%. Think of that one. And I’m the only president in 51 years, that had a year, last year, where drug prices came down, but that was peanut stuff compared to what I’m talking about. So when you see those ads, if you don’t mind, and you see the drug companies hitting me, you’ll say, “Thank you, President Trump for reducing drug prices.” I guarantee you, if they were going up, they wouldn’t be taking ads. It makes sense, I guess, right? I hope people understand that, because they are spending a lot of money. They don’t like me. I did something that was unthinkable.

Check out the words, favored nation, check out the word rebate, because now I take the rebate for the people and I take the rebate to reduce the prices. They took the rebate, went to a middleman. The middleman, I never heard the term middlewoman, but I guess probably that too. But the middleman got all this money, I don’t know who they are, nobody knows who they are. The middlemen, you always hear it, they made more money than the drug companies. At least the drug companies made a product, but the middleman is not liking Donald Trump too much. I probably have a lot of friends that are middlemen. I don’t even know if they have beautiful homes. I say, I wonder where they made their money? They’re very wealthy, but they’re not so wealthy anymore.

We are getting the rebates. We’re keeping the money for our people. We will create tax credits for companies that bring jobs from China back to America, and we’ll impose tariffs on companies that leave America to produce jobs overseas. One of the things in the USMCA that was very important, I don’t want our companies going to Mexico, going to Canada anymore. I watched that. I was man of the year, 11 years ago in Michigan. I don’t know why, but they picked me. That was long before I thought in terms of running. Are we glad I ran?
I think so. I think so. What do you think? Yes? I think so. But that was long before I thought about this, Mike, and I was in Michigan, very nice, man of the year, that was great, and I said, “They’re taking your car companies and moving them all to Mexico.” Anyway, 32% of our cars are made in Mexico. How crazy? But it’s that way, that’s the way it happened. But I said, the most important deal in the USMCA, I don’t want anybody moving to Mexico, firing their people, moving there, making a car, selling it in for no tax. I don’t want that anymore, can’t happen, and that’s not going to happen. There is such a huge economic disincentive to do that.

So we’ll strip federal contracts from companies that outsource critical industries, we’re going to strip it. With the help of Minnesota workers, we will be the premier medical and pharmaceutical manufacturer anywhere in the world, and you see it already. The drug companies are starting to give up. Now, I’ll tell you, if for some reason, the other side happens to have a victory on November 3rd, forget everything I said. It’ll all be made in China Plus, it’ll all be made in other countries like Vietnam, and other places. And you can just forget everything I said, because they’re typical politicians, but radical left wing. They will go right back to it, but even more so.

To protect our families and workers during the China pandemic, I sealed our border against illegal immigration, and suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs. And yet, if you’re a farmer, a factory owner and you had people coming in from years, we made it easier for those people to keep coming in. I can’t shut them off, you’d have to close up your businesses. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has pledged to allow virtually unlimited immigration during a global pandemic, spreading the virus, overwhelming our healthcare system, and displacing millions of American job seekers. The Biden plan would institute catch and release, I got rid of it, along the entire Southwest border. This is where you catch perhaps a murderer, perhaps a rapist. You catch somebody, you take their number and you release them. You say, “Please show up to court in three years,” nobody shows up. 1% show up. You know who the 1% are? The ones that aren’t very smart. They’re the ones that show up, they’re the only ones that show up.
 So we’ve built almost 300 miles of border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles each way, and if we didn’t have that, we’d be in trouble because sadly… And the President of Mexico is a friend of mine, he’s a great guy, Lacy, he’s a great guy like you, but I said to him, “We have to do this, and in the meantime, you have to give us a lot of troops along our border, because we’re paying you a lot of money with your cars, and otherwise I’m going to have to tariff.” And he said, “No, no, no. We will give you troops.” We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border. Nobody’s coming through unless we want them to. We have to come in legally into our country on the Southern border and elsewhere. We have 27,000 troops. You didn’t even know that, Tom, 27,000.

Furthermore, Joe Biden has pledged to increase refugee resettlement by not a bad number, 700%. You read that, right? That’s in the manifesto. He would overwhelm Minnesota with refugees, from terror hotspots, depleting public services, burdening schools, and straining city budgets. You already know about the hotspots, don’t you? You know about it. You’re having plenty of problems in Minnesota. And I’m going to be so politically correct, I’m not going to say a thing, but I know all about your hotspots, you got some hotspots. Very unfair to Minnesota, I will tell you that. And I’ll tell you, if I don’t win Minnesota, I’m never going to do it if I run for a third or fourth term, okay? I’ll never be back if I run, I’ve given up. I almost won last time. One more speech, Mike? almost won. I went to Michigan, I had a choice. I shouldn’t tell you this, but we won Michigan. One more speech, I would’ve won. I was so close, but if I don’t win it this time, I’m not coming back, never. Not for term three, four, five, or six.

Under my administration, we’ve dramatically reduced refugee resettlement and we’ve suspended refugee resettlement during the pandemic, you know that we’ve totally suspended it, nobody comes in. Lucky we have the wall, we’re up to 300 miles almost. If we didn’t have that wall, we would be inundated with people and unfortunately, and we’re helping them, we sent them a lot of ventilators and other equipment, but Mexico is being overrun with the pandemic and we would really have a problem. We’ve completely reformed refugee policy. We’ve instituted rigorous national security checks. We protected religious minorities, and we’ve shifted refugee admissions away from terror afflicted nations, like Syria, and Somalia.

And remember, they say we don’t have it, we do have it. They understand that, they just don’t want to say it. We have a ban, you know that. We have a ban on people coming into our country illegally, we have a ban on countries, because we want people to come into our country who love our country, who can love our country, who respect our country, and who are going to come in on merit, merit, merit, which is the exact opposite of what was happening. Many of them hated our country and they didn’t come in on merit. All they do is complain. Do you know anybody like that? They just complain. Does anybody know anybody like that? Do you know anybody? One of your colleagues? You call her a colleague? All she does is complain. I won’t mention the name, because you’ll never guess, complains, complains, complains. I don’t like that. I don’t like it. All she does is complain, “Not good enough!” Oh really? Tell us about it.

To protect our security, my administration instituted a travel ban on the world’s most dangerous regions. Biden has pledged to immediately end this travel ban and allow unlimited migration from terror zones, including Syria, Somalia, Libya, Iran, and Yemen. Trouble, trouble. I also kept the promise I made to Minnesota four years ago. I signed an executive order requiring state and local consent before any refugees are admitted. Biden would immediately shred that executive order, overriding local communities like yours, you know that. Did you know I signed that? You have to give approval now. Little different than the old days, isn’t it, huh? A little bit different. The old days was a lot different, and I signed that approval. They have to go through a process now, and you have to approve it. Why should we send everybody up to Minnesota or any place else?
 
In recent weeks, Democrat-controlled cities have shown the Democrats’ plan and what they plan for America. In Minneapolis, 700 buildings were burned, damaged, or destroyed, costing more than $1 billion. I just left, incredible people. We were on a runway like this, and I introduced them. Their businesses were burned down, gone, and they don’t know what they’re going to do, but we’re going to try helping them to get them rebuilt. But five groups of people that were just incredible people, successful, wonderful people, their stores and businesses were burned down, destroyed. Dozens of business owners have announced they are considering moving hundreds of jobs out of Democrat run Minneapolis, you know that. You know that. Criminals are terrorizing civilians in-

You know that, criminals are terrorizing civilians in Chicago, Portland, and now New York City. This radical left Mayor de Blasio has let our beautiful diamond, I loved it, I left it four years ago. I could see there were the seeds of problems. He was there, but I left and it was wonderful. Four years ago I left it, and over the last year, especially over the last six months, crime has gone up hundreds of percentage points, hundreds. 273 points, 368 points. Numbers that you wouldn’t believe. And we’re talking about shootings, murders, you saw what happened this weekend. You saw that, Jason. Terrible. My city, I love that city, but it has great potential and we’re going to do something. We’re going to do something strong. They just let it go to hell and I don’t know is it because they’re bad people or they have no common sense, or they just don’t know what they’re doing? But our beautiful diamond, of this country, has been let go to hell.

Top Democrats have demanded the defunding of police departments. Biden even referred to the police at the enemy. And that’s what it is. He’s not going to control… look, he’s not going to control the situation. He’s dealing with… how about the congress woman that I watched over weekend, right? Saying, “I have total control over Biden. He’ll do anything I say. I have total control.” What she’s saying is, “I have total control over this jerk. He’ll do whatever the hell I want.” That’s putting it in more common language. But she said just as mean as that.

You know who I’m talking about, right? You saw that? What a horrible statement to make and frankly Kamala, nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kamala. I mean, nobody. He was called a racist and just about everything else under the book. Then all of a sudden she saying, “He’s such a fine man.” Look nobody treated him, including Pocahontas, nobody on the debate stage, nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kamala Harris and she’s got some big issues.

Congress woman Ilhan Omar-
I mean I hear the boo’s. How the hell did she win the primary? How did she win the… [Lacey 00:50:26], what the hell happened Lacey?
Huh? It’s Jason’s fault. How the hell did she win? This woman is crazy. She’s a horrible woman who hates our country. Yeah, mail in vote, you might be right. We’ll have to check it. Let’s check the mail in vote. No, seriously how does a woman who hates our country, who says nothing but bad things about our country and Israel and other of our allies, how does this woman win? Where are the people that would vote for her? Omar called the Minneapolis police the cancer and said they were rotten to the root, but Joe Biden did not condemn the comments. He didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t disavow her endorsement. He displays it proudly on his website. This is what’s going to be running the country.

This is the biggest change between what happened between now and Crooked Hillary. Crooked Hillary was bad news, right? Remember she said, “Will you accept the results of the election? Will you accept the results of this election?” And I sort of said, “Yeah, maybe.” But she didn’t accept them, right? I remember that question. That was probably the toughest question I had out of all of them. But she hasn’t been exactly a gracious loser. She’s a loser, but not a gracious one.

If Joe Biden and the radical Dems take power, they will pass legislation gutting every single police department in America. That’s going to happen. The Biden Bernie manifesto calls for appointing far left prosecutors, judges, and justices of the United States Supreme Court.

Look, we have a big thing with the court. The next president has a chance to do three, four, could even be five. You will change this country around. It will be irreversible. It will be irreversible and they’ll coddle criminals and punish law abiding citizens, these judges will. They’ll take away your guns while letting criminal gangs like MS-13 roam free. Your Second Amendment will… look it was under siege, but not really, because they had never… right fellows? They played the game with… they had no chance. When I’m here, they have no chance. Your Second Amendment is cherished. You need your Second Amendment. They will either take it away, or obliterate it into meaningless nothing.

In Joe Biden’s America, the protections of American citizenship will be stripped away and your community will be left at the mercy of the mob. I mean I’m saying these things, but I mean them. When I look at what happened in Minneapolis, when you look at what’s going on in different cities that are just unbelievable cities. Remember this though, most of the country is very safe. In fact, crime stats, outside of Chicago, New York, a couple of the crime stats are a record low. Our country’s… even during the pandemic we’re doing well, but where they’re run by the Liberal Democrats, we’re not doing well. And we have to get in. They have to ask us. We had to be asked here. They have to ask us unless we take a very severe action which ideally you don’t want to take. But every time we go in, we solve the problem and we solve it very quickly.

Seattle, look at what’s going on with Seattle. I mean this is a city. This is a real city and they took over a large portion of that city and they knew we were going in the following day. They knew it. So they sent their police in and it was like nobody ever gave up so easily as those characters. But they’re radical left anarchists. Whether you’re registered as a Democrat, Independent, or Republican, I’m asking for the vote of every American who believes that police officers are not enemies, but heroes who keep us safe.

I also want to send our special thanks to the members of the Minnesota National Guard who did such an incredible job stopping the rioting, violence, mayhem in Minneapolis. They were great. They were great. I love them. I love that. It’s just a beautiful thing. It’s the way it’s supposed to work. They cause problems, you have to do it. And the sooner you do it the easier it is to do.

My administration had made clear to every mayor and governor in the country that the federal government is ready to send the National Guard and federal reinforcements. We will wipe out the problem within minutes. You saw it happening right here. You wouldn’t have a city if we didn’t demand that that take place. You wouldn’t have a city.

All you have to do is say the word. Every voter should ask themselves a simple question, do you want the radical left policies of Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco imposed on the entire country? Look at Nancy Pelosi. San Francisco’s going to hell and she’s in Congress saying what we should be doing. Look at the homeless problem in San Francisco. Look at what’s happening in San Francisco and then she’s telling us about the post office. She has no clue and I must tell you this, does she love our country? Does she love our country? I don’t think so, to be honest with you. What she’s done is a disgrace to our country. What she’s done, and Schumer Crying Chuck. Crying Chuck. He cries whenever its important to cry. You want the failed policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio? Or Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago?
Or mayor Jacob Frey?
Brought to every city and town in this nation? If left wing Democrats can’t run a city, why on earth would you let them run your country? We have such incredibly run cities. Such incredibly run cities. The problems with have are the radical left and now she wants one trillion dollars and she’s holding it up using a phony excuse of the post office because she wants a trillion dollars to go… and you guys all know this, she wants one trillion dollars to go to these badly run democrat cities and states. That’s what she wants and she’s using the post office. We want to fix the post office and make it better. Should have been fixed 30 years ago.

Over the next four years, we’re going to implement an aggressive strategy to fight violent crime. It’s already been implemented and we’ll expand the surge of federal law enforcement into crime plagued cities and we can do that at will. We just have to hear from your governor. Just call up, let us know, we’ll be there. We are ready, willing, and able.

… American child is safe on our streets. In which every American family is secure in their homes, and in which all of the American people are confident in our destiny. But to achieve this vision, we must finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And get Jason in there please, Jason Lewis, get him in. Jason, you got to win. Get Jason Lewis. Jason Lewis. Got to win Jason. You’re certainly against a weak opponent. You got to win.

For years left wing politicians like Joe Biden talked about supporting American workers. Then they got elected and gave away your jobs, shipped away your factories, and they sold off your dreams, your beautiful, beautiful American dreams. They sold them off to the highest bidder. But under this administration, those days are over. Now you have a president who is fighting for you.

Over the next four years, we will fully restore America’s manufacturing independence. We will again rebuild the greatest economy in history. It’s happening very fast. You’re going to see it very soon. I’d lift it to even more incredible heights than what we had last year. You had the greatest year in the history of your state last year. We will revitalize police departments and reclaim our cities for law abiding Americans. We will protect religious liberty, defend the lives of our beautiful unborn children, appoint conservative judges, uphold free speech on college campuses, and safeguard the Second Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms.

We will ensure American dominance in space and in military and pave the way to becoming the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. We’re working on that, we’re doing very well. By the way when I took over NASA, it was dead. It was gone, right? It was gone. There was nothing. There was grass growing on the runways… grass, through the crevices on the runway. It was terrible and now it’s the most vital space program anywhere in the world. Not only the jobs, but the importance of it and the psychology of it, and by the way, for military defense. And we created Space Force. Think of that, we created another one of many, many things. First time in 78 years. Last one was the Air Force, right? Space Force, that’s a big deal. By itself. If a president did that, they would have achieved something. We did that and we did hundreds of other things.

We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to respect our great American flag. We will never waiver in defense of our families, our values, our faith, our jobs, our borders, our rights, or our freedoms. Together we will unite citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed as one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.

I want to thank you, you are incredible people, Minnesota. Thank you very much. I’ll be back. November 3rd, we have to win. God bless you, God bless the great state of Minnesota and God bless America. Thank you all very much.",17/8/20
"Thank you very much. This is really great. We love this state. We won this state. I don’t know if you know what’s going on outside, but that’s … Right, Lou? That’s as many people as you can possibly have all the way back. How did you get in? That’s my question. I know you’re special friends of a group of people that have done a really good job, and I want to thank you very much for being here. But Pennsylvania has been very important to me. I went to school in Pennsylvania, as you know, college, and I love it. Please sit down. And by the time I finished, I’m going to have a nice sunburn right here. This is good. Where’s my sunblock?

But I want to thank everybody. In 75 days, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years. They’ve had us under siege, and we beat them, and we beat them, and we keep beating them. But I’ll tell you, I’ve never seen anything … No president should have to go through what we’ve gone through. No president. Should never happen. And I watched President Obama last night, and I watched him talking about everything, and I had to put it out. I said, yeah, but he spied on our campaign, and he got caught. That’s about as bad a thing as you can imagine. If that happened to another campaign on the other side, they would have had 25 people in jail for many years already. Many, many years. It’s a disgrace.

But in three years, and what we’ve done in just this short period of time, there’s been no administration that’s accomplished what we’ve accomplished, and that’s despite pandemics and despite all of the opposition and all of the witch hunts, the phony witch hunts. No administration has done what we’ve done. We’ve secured our borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt our military, wiped out the ISIS caliphate 100%, killed our terrorist enemies, achieved American energy independence, and guess what? We’re just getting started. That’s just a small part of it. That’s a small part of it.

At stake in this election is the, and you know this, you know it, and I mean it, and I’ve never meant it more. At stake in this election is the survival of our nation. It’s true. Because we’re dealing with crazy people in the other side. They’ve gone totally stone cold crazy. You know, you look at Hillary. She was a lot smarter than Joe. But I’ll tell you, there was a certain sense of sanity four years ago. These people have gone insane, and they’re radical left, and you look at some of the things happening in these Democrat- run cities, which we could solve in two minutes. All they’d have to do is call us, right? Our great ex-congressman. All they have to do is … And thank you for being here. But all they have to do is call us. We’ll be in there in two minutes, and we’ll take care of the problem.

Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. They don’t understand, and probably when it happened, they’d say, what did we ever do? Joe Biden has pledged to hike your taxes by $4 trillion in the largest tax hike in history. And they’re going to waste the money on the Green New Deal, the Green New Deal. You know what you get out of that? Nothing. Nothing except debt and death. They want to eviscerate the Second Amendment. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away your guns. Well, you remember that, just that one point alone, and they want to take away your guns. So who’s going to vote for that? I mean, we want our Second Amendment. I’ve held it strong, and you think it was easy? I’ve held it totally strong.

Give free healthcare to illegal aliens. You don’t get free healthcare? Expand deadly sanctuary cities. Force taxpayers to subsidize late-term abortion. Shut down the energy fields of Pennsylvania. They want to shut them down. No fossil fuels. No fossil fuel. Texas isn’t too happy, either. Go to Texas. I just left Texas a little while ago, two weeks. I said, they don’t want energy, they don’t want guns, and they don’t want religion. A guy stands up, says, “Not going to win Texas!” But you have the same thing, because you do a big, you’re a big fracking state. You want to see your taxes go up? Stop fracking. Doesn’t hurt you at all, fracking. They want to throw up windmills that are going to ruin your houses. Put up a big windmill. You walk out your door. You’ll see those big monsters churning. But even that they don’t want to do. I don’t think they want to do anything. I think they want to close your businesses.

But just remember, Second Amendment. They’re going to take it away. As sure as you’re sitting or standing. They’re going to take it away from you. The Second Amendment. Don’t let it happen.

Close down charter schools. Eliminate school choice. So important. Abolish the suburbs. They want to put low-income housing in the suburbs. So the American dream … And by the way, we have a lot of minority groups that live in the suburbs. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, all did phenomenally last year with jobs. Best jobs we’ve ever had in the history of our country, the best economy we’ve ever had. But they’re a big part of the suburbs. And they want to put low income housing in the suburbs at a level that they’ve never done it before. And it’s been a very … Look, this has been going on for 20 years. I terminated the regulation that did that. They said, “Well, we can change that.” I said, “No, let’s terminate it.” People have to aspire to go there. They want to aspire to live in the suburbs.

They want to abolish cash bail, releasing 400,000 criminals onto our streets. Think of no … No more cash bail. Look at what happened in New York. Cuomo ended cash bail. Cuomo. That wasn’t even DeBlasio that did it. It was Cuomo, the governor. He ended it in New York, and now the crime rate has gone through the roof. The speaker at Biden’s convention, proudly declared, we’re talking about abolishing the police. We’re talking about abolishing ICE, and we’re talking about abolishing prisons. And that’s, the only thing they’re not abolishing are taxes because your taxes are going to go up at a level that you’ve never even heard of before.

If you want a vision of your life under Biden presidency, think of the smoldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago, and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in America. You’re not going to have law and order. Do you notice? And I shouldn’t say it because he’ll put it in his speech, if he can read it, which I doubt. But they’ll put it in there tonight. I shouldn’t say it because he’s going to speak later. He’s going to have a good audience. People are going to find out what the hell’s going on. I see he hasn’t answered a question since, they just said … Did you see it on the newscasts? Since July 17th. Hasn’t taken a question from the fake news back there. No, think of it.

I take about a hundred questions a day. These people. It’s one thing I’ve learned, the people heading these other countries, whether it’s President Xi of China, Putin of Russia, Erdogan, Turkey, any of them, Kim Jong Un, North Korea. Remember we’re going to be in war with North Korea? Remember? It’s going to be a war? Right, congressman? There’s going to be a war. If Trump’s, oh, we’re going to have a war. No, it would have been a war if you had Hillary Clinton. Would’ve been a war if Obama were allowed to stay any longer. He thought there was going to be a war. Where’s the war? I don’t see the war. Maybe things happen. You don’t know. But there’s been no war. Nobody killed. He would have lost 25, 30 million people. They don’t say that. They say a hundred thousand people. No, no. Seoul is 32 million people, and it’s right next to the cannon fire. And we have a good relationship with him. I have a good relationship with him. You know, when I say that, isn’t that terrible? They say. No, it’s not terrible. It’s great. It’s great. I have a relationship.

President Obama said when I sat down that first meeting, right? In the White House. He said it was the biggest problem we had. North Korea. And you would have had a big problem, would have been a hell of a war. Tell you right now. You’d probably be in that war right now. So when I say that we got along and we’ve met, everyone says, oh, that’s so terrible. No, it’s a good thing. It’s a good thing. Not a bad thing. It’s a good thing. Doesn’t mean bad things don’t happen, but it’s a good thing.

There’s only one thing standing between your family and the radical left wing mob, and that’s your vote this November. This is a very important … I feel like I’m a wall. You know, we built the wall on the Southern border. We’re going to have 300 miles by two weeks from now, even less, 300 miles. And by the end of the year, we’ll be up to almost 500 miles, and then we’re going to go on a little bit further, some areas that are loose, a little bit loose. We found out. We’re going to put a little bit more, about 536 miles going up at a record clip. It’s doing phenomenally well.

If you want mobs and criminals, you got to vote Democrat. Look, because that’s what it’s about. They don’t talk about law and order. Now, I’m bringing it up now, but they haven’t, I haven’t seen anybody get up … I got just the other day endorsed by all the sheriffs of Florida, all the law enforcement. I got endorsed by Pennsylvania. I got endorsed by Texas, by Ohio. I think everybody, I don’t know. How can you endorse somebody else? How could law enforcement endorse somebody else?

We gave all of our ex-army equipment. We have tremendous surplus equipment, and it was sitting in warehouses all over the United States. Hundreds of millions of dollars, I distributed it to the police, whereas Biden and Obama, they didn’t want to do that because they said, no, no, no. It makes the police look too strong. I want the police to look strong. You got to look strong. And a lot of it was protective equipment.

If you want jobs and you want a lot of police and you want a lack of crime, if you take away New York and Chicago and some of these terrible cities that you see about with the crime, the crime is so bad. I left New York four years ago, and I could see, because he’s a terrible mayor, I could see there were things that were happening that were bad. He’s no Rudy Giuliani, I can tell you that. But I could see things were happening. But the last six months, seven months, it just exploded. It’s incredible. Crime up 368%, 368%. It’s crazy. It’s crazy.

But if you want law and order, and I can say it, sometimes they’ll say, sir, say it gently. People want to hear gentle. They don’t want, say it gently. Don’t say law and order. Say, if you’d like law and order and safety. Nah, I can’t do that. If you want law and order, you’ve got to have law and order. You can’t have what’s happening in Portland. Did you see the kid get whacked the other day? Just whacked, like he was a piece of garbage? I mean, who could take it? We don’t want that, and pretty soon we’re going to have to send in our people because we’re supposed to wait to request?

Now, I don’t know if they’re embarrassed or what, but these Democrat cities, they’re out of control. They have none. Look at Seattle, where she said, no, we want a summer of love. I mean, this woman is crazy, and they would have never taken back Seattle except they knew we were going in the next day. That’s the only reason they even did it. So tonight we have slow Joe will speak at the Democrat Convention, and I’m sure that he’ll just knock them dead.

And he’ll remind us that he was born in Scranton. But you know, he left like 70 years ago, right? He left a long time ago. He wasn’t one … I view it differently. He’d say he was born here, but he left when he was like eight, nine, or 10. So he left, 68 years ago, he left. Long time ago. So I view it differently. He wasn’t born here. He abandoned Scranton. Okay? His family had something to do with that. You know, his parents. But he loves Scranton. I mean, he keeps talking about, I was born in Scranton. I lived in Scranton. Yeah, for a few years, and then he left for another state. You know the state. But this Scranton stuff. That’s why I figured I’d come here and explain to you one thing. But I think you people know it better than I do. He left! He abandoned Pennsylvania. He abandoned Scranton. He was here for a short period of time and he didn’t even know it. And today it’s amazing. It goes around in a circle. He still doesn’t know it.

But he spent the last half century in Washington selling out our country and ripping off our jobs and letting other countries steal our jobs, Mexico, China, all of them stealing our jobs. He’s been there for 47 years, and now he’s going to come in and make a change. I don’t think so. His son who walked out with $1.5 billion to manage. That’s billions of dollars a year, and the son didn’t even have a job before that. And I asked the Wall Street people, tell me, is that possible? Smartest people, top people on Wall Street. They say, can’t happen. It can’t happen. The smartest people, the people that do get money from every country, from everybody, they say can’t happen. He walked out of there in 10 minutes with $1.5 billion. You explain that one, right?

And then if they want to look at him, nobody looks at him. Nobody looks at Ukraine. He gets 83,000 a month and a $3 million upfront payment because of his great expertise in energy. But he had none. And he even admitted, no, I don’t know anything about energy. But he goes onto an energy company. It’s millions of dollars, 83, it’s actually double that because it was him and some guy that knew less than he did. And is that okay? Yeah? Is it okay when Joe Biden goes and says, a billion dollars, you’re not getting it unless you get rid of those prosecutors. You talk about quid pro quo, right? That’s your quid pro quo. And they did, quid pro quo. Right? And they did, they got rid of the prosecutors. And then he’s called. He says, now you’re getting your money. Okay?

Figure this. How about if that’s a Republican doing that, what happens to that republican? It’s over. It’s a disgrace. But it’s changing slowly, too slowly, as far as I’m concerned. Joe Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania. He’s actually, for the reasons we just said, he’s your worst nightmare. Biden supported every single globalist attack on Pennsylvania workers, NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which built China into a power, TPP, Korea, the horrible, ridiculous Paris Climate Accord, which stripped our nation of its energy, and the so-called Clean Power Plan. The only good thing about it was the name. It was a horrible, unfair deal, horrible for you and horrible for Pennsylvania. They want to take your power away. You know what your power is? Your power is the billions of dollars you make in going deep into the earth and taking out-

As you make on going deep into the earth and taking out what you have to take out. Everything you want, from fracking. You don’t realize how big a fracking state. Does anybody know how big fracking is? You’re not going to be allowed to frack anymore. You’re not going to be allowed. No oil, no nothing. No oil, no gas, no nothing. Just think of that. What would happen is, well, first of all, many of you, I guess 600,000, 670,000 lose their jobs. No money, no oil, higher taxes. Your stock market would crash. If they get in beyond fracking, if they get in, you’ll have your 401ks, which are setting records, by the way, stock market just hit a new high.

And don’t forget, we’ve been going through this horrible plague from China. It just hit a new high. So think of that. It’s incredible. But your 401ks. How many people have 401ks here? Good. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. How about if they went down to like 10% of what they are now? Because that can happen. That can happen. And it will happen if we’re stupid and we don’t go out and vote and secure your ballot. Absentee ballots are good. But the stuff where they take millions and millions of ballots and send them all over the place, we’ll grab it and we’ll just put them in a big pile there. Everyone grab it. It’s a disgrace. Even common sense tells you that. Look at New York, look at what happened in New Jersey. Look at what happened in Virginia. Look at what happened. I won’t go through the details, you know the story.

They have no control whatsoever. In New Jersey, 20% of the ballots were defective, fraudulent, 20%. And that’s because they did a good job. Okay? So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election. I really believe that. I saw the crowd outside. For every sign we had for Trump Pence, every single sign. And that’s not that atypical in Texas. We had people on the highways, on the roadways, we’re driving to some oil well where we gave a speech. It was a 20 minute drive, between the plane and that oil well, there were tens of thousands of people and they had the signs, Trump and Trump Pence and flags, American flags.

When the other side does show up, which is rarely, they never have an American flag. I can always tell if there’s a group of people. You never see an American flag. The fake news would tell you that. But you never see, but they don’t put it down, they’ll tell you that personally, but they won’t write it. But you never see an American flag. It’s an amazing thing. But if you look outside today, is it a hundred to one, 200 to one? And then you’ll read tomorrow that Biden was well-represented. He wasn’t well, there were hardly anybody there.

Every once in a while, I’d see a Biden that’d be waving to the people. I’d see Biden, I’d say, “Wow.” I waved to her anyway. Who cares? But was it a hundred to one? It’s just massive. And you’ll read tomorrow that he had a massive crowd also. Pennsylvania lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs after NAFTA and China’s entry into the WTO. And that was a vote and courtesy of sleepy Joe. Biden looked American labor into the eyes and took care of dues, their union endorsements and their votes. The unions, I mean the unions have to be more reasonable. They have to be more reasonable. And we love the unions. We love non-union. I’ve had it all. I built every building I built in New York was with unions and unions are fine.

A lot of Republicans don’t want me to say that, but I’ll tell you, unions are fine. Tell them to keep their dues down, please. But they’re fine. And you have unions here. You have non-unions. What I talk about is the worker. They treated our workers horribly. We lost our jobs to foreign lands. Our workers got fired, whether they were in the unions or not. Then he sold out and he passed the Cadillac tax. You know what that is, on union healthcare plans? Attack their energy jobs and sent their factories to China. And now he’s back begging for their votes. And it’s like a custom, Democrats. Except with me. I came in, I got so many union votes. I get far more. I mean, you’ve seen it. A couple of people either lost their job or came very close, that were unbeatable, because they let it charge for the Democrats for crooked Hillary last time.

They let her charge. And the people in the union didn’t want that. They didn’t want Hillary, they wanted Trump. And we had union revolts, we call them. They revolted. But these guys right here, are you all union people? I can tell. Are you union? It’s good, right? It’s fine. That’s fine. Look at that. You got a hand. Certain parts of the country, they wouldn’t be as happy, but that’s okay, right? And it’s great. But they were not happy. And you know what was happening? They were not happy when the bosses got endorsed by the Democrats. American labor will vote for Trump Pence in 2020. They’re all saying that. And this area is going to be an incredible area. This used to be all Democrat until I came along. Until I came along, this was Democrat. This was heavily union. It was Democrat. It was everything.

But they liked Trump and I’m going to never let you down and they will let you down. They will let you down. First of all, the country will be let down because the country, you will see a crash like you’ve never seen before. And as good as those stock market numbers are, there’s a headwind. They headwind is that if he won, the market’s going to crash. The Green New Deal, all of the different things, socialized medicine, that’s what they want. It’s socialized medicine. No doctor, no plan. Obama lied about it 28 times. Do you remember he said, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.” It wasn’t true. 28 different times, they have them. For the last four years, we’ve been reversing Biden’s betrayals and delivering historic wins. For the people of Pennsylvania, your state lost over 50,000 manufacturing jobs when Biden was vice president. In my first three years, Pennsylvania gained 14, 000 jobs, manufacturing, and going up at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. We’ll catch all of those jobs that were lost.

They said manufacturing jobs will never come back. Remember, you need a magic wand. Where’s the magic wand? Well, we have the magic wand. My first week in office, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific partnership. It would have been totally destructive to your jobs. It would have been a horror show. I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord, which would have cost us so many billions of dollars. And all it would have done is made the competition even tougher all over the world. I believe it was designed to hurt the United States and to get jobs away from us and companies. I stood up to China’s rampant cheating, plunder, and theft. I repealed that horrible tax. So many taxes. How many taxes did I repeal? I’m getting a list of them now, I’ll have it for you for the next meeting. Because I’ll be back to Pennsylvania, that I promise. And I’m standing up to the special interests and to big pharma. Weeks ago, I signed four historic directives to dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs.

Think of it. You know what I did? I signed, as you know and as you’ve seen, I guess, but other countries have sometimes 10% of what we pay for the same exact pill, same drug, same prescription drug. And I signed a deal that we get, it’s not signed by the drug companies, they hate it. They’ll take in advertising. Whenever you see bad ads on me from drug companies, just remember one thing, that means your prices are coming down. That means your prices. But it’s called Favored Nations, Favored Nations. We were the least favorite nation in the whole world. We paid the highest price. So I signed if Germany has an example, pays 25 cents for a pill and we pay $3 for the exact same pill, we pay 25 cents also. Now what means is they’re going to go up, we’re going to come way down.

We could drop drug prices by 50, 60 or 70%, at a level that has made them very angry. And rebates too, I ended rebates. Rebates go to you. Nobody else would have done that. They could have done that a long time ago. Biden could have done it. He didn’t know what it meant. But I will tell you, most people do know what, but they can’t do it because big pharma is the most powerful group. And I guess they say, number one, is it number one, mister? But you didn’t take any money from big pharma, right? I bet you didn’t. I’ll bet you didn’t, my man. I ended the NAFTA disaster and I signed USMCA in Deloitte. USMCA is phenomenal. And it’s going to keep your companies from moving to Mexico and other places. After years of building up other nations, we’re finally building up our nation and we are finally doing something that I’ve been talking about for years. We’re finally putting America first, and I’ve done that right from the beginning.

We’re honored to be joined today by some incredible warriors that were really fantastic to me and friends of mine, but they really fight. These Pennsylvania people are fighters, in case you haven’t noticed. Representative Scott Perry. Scott, where’s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Great job, Scott. The warriors. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd, thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. John Joyce. John, thank you. Great job. Great job. And a friend of mine and a great, great man. He would have been here forever if he decided to, but he decided maybe it was time to do something else. But this was a fighter like no other fighter. And those three other gentlemen will attest, right? Our friend Lou Barletta. Lou. And they’re shouting. I’m saying this for the media. They’re shouting “Lou”, they’re not booing. They’ll say, “He stood up and he got booed horribly. It was a horrible embarrassing.” No, that’s what they do. They’re fake. Thanks also to our congressional candidates, Jim Bognet. Jim, oh, look at him. I’ve heard good things, Jim. Is it easy out there on the stump?
Good, good. And you’re going to win, Jim. You’re going to win. And Lisa Scheller. Lisa, thank you very much. Great job. I hear you too are doing really good. If you have any problems, call Lou, he’ll help you. Let me also thank my campaign state chairwoman, Bernie Comfort. Where are you? Thank you very much Bernie. Thank you, Bernie. Great job you’re doing. How are we doing in Pennsylvania? Okay?
I think so. I think so. If we don’t, they did a lot of manipulation. Also, a friend of mine for a long time and a great friend of his father and maybe his grandfather. I don’t even know. I hate to say that because it makes me sound a little bit older than I feel. I feel young. State GOP Chairman, Lawrence Tabas. What a great family. I miss Dan Tabas. You know that? Dan Tabas, what a great man he was. I don’t know if you know him, but he started out with about 2 cents and he ended up being a rich man. And he employed a lot of people and he was a real friend of mine. That was long before I ran for politics. He didn’t like many people, but he liked Trump. Right? People would go, “He’s a rough guy.” People would go up to him and say, “Hi, Dan. How you doing?” He became a very successful guy. And he’d look out and say, “I don’t want to talk to anybody. I just want to talk to Trump.” I like that kind of a guy, right?

But he was a fantastic man, actually. He was a good man. Before the China virus invaded our shores, we built the greatest economy in history, nothing even close. We added seven million jobs nationwide, including 209,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania. By the way, in the last three months, right Bernie? Over nine million jobs, an all time record. This is now during and hopefully closing moments of the pandemic. You notice how they, anytime there’s a good country, they like to compare, because we’ve done an incredible job. You look at our mortality rates, you look at all the things. But they like to compare us to others. So they were talking about New Zealand. New Zealand, it’s over, it’s over for Zealand. Everything’s gone. They’re beautiful. They had a massive breakout yesterday. South Korea, it’s over, it’s over. Big breakout yesterday. It’s a tough deal.

We’ve done a great job. We’re a big, big country. And maybe this is popular to say, maybe it’s not, I don’t care. Because based on the crowd outside, it looks to me like we’re going to win this thing. I think, by the way, by a lot. But your governor has you on a shut down like, what’s going on? How did they all get out there? And they were not socially distanced, I can tell you. We’ll have to. On the way back, they’ll still be there because they’re incredible people. But what is he doing? He’s got you in a shutdown, still. Shut down wolf. He can’t do this. He’s going to destroy your soul. What happens is depression, anxiety problems with family members, drugs, heart attacks, obesity. I mean, what is he doing? It’s more dangerous than the virus.

He’s got to open this state up. You know when he’s going to open it up? No, I know what he’s doing. Because a lot of them are doing it, doing it in the great State of North Carolina, right? They’re doing it in North Carolina. But they’re doing it in a lot of different areas. They’ve got to open this state up and you have to do it, right? This wonderful, incredible Commonwealth. Right? I would call it a Commonwealth. Do you ever mind of they call it a state? No, call it Commonwealth. Whatever the hell you want to open it up. And what is he doing? What is he doing? So the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we’re going to get it open. And I know when he’s going to do it. You know when it is? November 4th. November 4th, he’s going to say, “Well, we’re going to open it up.”

Then your results are no better than other states, by the way. It’s not like, “Oh gee, this is great.” Michigan has it closed down and North Carolina has a closed down, and this Commonwealth has a closed down. It’s a very sad thing to see. And the results are not good. The results, it’s not like, “Oh, this is wonderful.” The results in some of these places, as worse than those that are open. And you have other states. I mean, you look at the country, it’s really, we have states we’re thriving, we’re thriving. And there’s no shutdown. It’s enough. We shut it down because we had to, we didn’t know anything about what was happening. We shut it down. We learned a lot. Protect our seniors, et cetera, et cetera. You’ve all heard it.

We learned a lot, protect our seniors, et cetera, et cetera. You’ve all heard it. But we learned a lot. Then we opened it up and now we have a big V. Remember they said the V will never happen? We have a big beautiful V. We enacted the largest financial relief package in American history. And through the Paycheck Protection Program, we saved nearly two million Pennsylvania jobs. We’ve also delivered nearly … That’s right. Two million jobs. We delivered nearly $11 billion in direct support to Pennsylvania families. And over the past three months, we’ve gained over nine million jobs. Nobody could even believe the numbers. And watch. The numbers will get better and better because we’re opening up.

And frankly, the Democrats should do it. They should do what’s right for the country. They know they should open. Wolf knows he should open. He knows that. And how about his person with her mother, right? With her mother? Where the mother was protected, but the other people weren’t. You had a massive number of deaths in nursing homes, but 95 year old mother as I read. And I said, “Well, that person will be gone very quickly.” And that person is still there. I would say that’s something that if somebody ever wants to run for the governor of Pennsylvania, that would be something good to use. So they took the mother out of harm’s way and then moved her back when everything was okay. And nobody says anything about it? There’s no firing?

Retail spending is now at an all time high. Who would have believed that? Auto production has gained 28%. Biden would terminate this unprecedented recovery. He wants to impose a permanent lockdown combined with a socialist takeover of the US economy. Did you hear him the other day? Lock it down. He wants to lock it down. So everything that we’ve gained over the last number of months, he wants to lock it down. No, we’re doing good. Florida’s going down substantially. Arizona, done a great job in Arizona. Texas going down. California is going down. They’d opened these states up and everybody wants to practice good hygiene. All of the different things. Do the masks. I mean, it’s just not going to hurt. Do them. Do them. You feel it, do them.

But these things, these places have to be opened up. But November 4th, you’ll open. Don’t worry about it. But that’s a long time from now if you think about it, right? That’s a long time for now. In Biden’s policy manifesto written with socialist Bernie Sanders, Biden pledges to quickly outlaw American oil. He’s going to outlaw American oil, coal, American coal. He’s going to outlaw it. Natural gas, which is really an amazing form of energy, it clean, by mandating net zero carbon emissions from all homes and buildings within nine years and from all power plants by 2035. So he wants to basically get rid of all fossil fuels.

And you know, I know everything about energy. I know so much about energy. Our new forms of alternative energy just aren’t powerful enough to power these massive plants and all of the things that are creating all of these jobs and all of this wealth for your state and for the country. This week in California, there were rolling blackouts because the radical Democrats have mandated impossible restrictions on energy production.

And I see again, the forest fires are starting. They’re starting again in California. I said, “You got to clean your floors. You got to clean your forests.” They have many, many years of leaves and broken trees. And they’re like, so flammable. You touch them and it goes up. I’ve been telling them this now for three years, but they don’t want to listen. The environment, the environment. But they have massive fires again in California. Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us.

We say, “You got to get rid of the leaves. You got to get rid of the debris. You got to get rid of the fallen trees.” You know when a tree falls, after 13 to 14 months, it becomes extremely dry. You look at some of these fires, they don’t really catch where the trees are growing because they’re wet. The water’s pouring up the tree. And they just don’t want to listen. They mocked us when I said that you got to clean your floors, just an expression. Clean the floors. And they have many, many years, decades of leaves, dry leaves. And that’s why they have it. There are other places, forest cities, they’re forests, they were developed in forests and they don’t have any problem, with more flammable trees than you have in California, but they just don’t want to do it.

Senior citizens were forced to sit in their homes with no air conditioning in the middle of the summer and Biden wants to eliminate power plants all across America. You had a problem over here. But think of that, if they do that, get used to no air conditioning. They probably don’t want that either. Under my administration, we ended the war on American energy and I put the miners back to work. We put them back to work. The miners are back to work now. I approved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipelines almost right at the beginning. I just approved them right at the beginning and a lot of jobs. And by the way, it’s a much cleaner form of transportation.

America is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Think of that one. To protect our great steelworkers … Do you have a couple of … Any steelworkers here by the way? To protect our great steelworkers, I placed tariffs on nations that were dumping cheap, foreign steel all over the place. And we have created an incredible industry out of nothing. It was ready to go out. Within months, steel imports dropped by 26% and American steel production surged by 18 million tons, almost immediately. Biden abandoned the steel industry and saved other industries that were worthless, but he didn’t save the steel industry. We saved the steel industry. You wouldn’t have a steel industry right now.

When Joe Biden was vice president, the border was an open pipeline for criminals, gang members and cartels, flooding our schools with drugs. Under my administration, we ended the catch and release, horrible catch and release. You catch the criminal. You take their name. You say, “Is this right?” “We don’t have identification.” “Oh, that’s okay.” It’s like voting. They don’t want to have voter ID. Why? There’s only one reason the Democrats don’t want voter ID. You have ID for almost everything. You have your picture, everything nice, but not on a vote. Most important thing you can do is to vote. And voter ID, but they don’t want it. There’s only one reason they don’t want voter ID. And you know what that is, right? That’s really better. You guys all in favor, by the way, of voter ID? Everybody? If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be congressmen in good standing for very long. I’ll tell you that.

We stopped asylum fraud and we deported 20,000 gang members and 423,000 criminal aliens. We got them the hell out of our country. But if Biden is elected, all of this security will quickly vanish. Control of the border will be seceded to violent cartels and the left wing crazies who empower them. And you used to see these massive amounts of illegals coming up from Honduras, from Guatemala, El Salvador. They’d come up and it’d be just thousands of them. You don’t see that anymore. Mexico is putting … They have right now. They have for months, 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border. You got to do it. You got to do it. Mexico has been really working with us very well. I have to tell you the new president of Mexico, now he’s not so new. He’s been there a little while. But the president of Mexico has done a great job as far as I’m concerned, from the standpoint of our relationship and our relationship with Mexico.

In his joint manifesto with Bernie Sanders, Biden just called for a complete suspension of deportations, closing down detention facilities, ending border prosecutions. Think of this. Restoring and expanding catch and release, handing out free welfare to new arrivals, work permits for illegal crossers, and mass amnesty for all illegal aliens. Can you believe this? This is Bernie plus … I feel like Biden would be taken right. This is to show you how good a negotiate he is. Bernie took him left. It’s supposed to start and they’re supposed to meet a little bit left of center maybe, for them. For us it’s right of center. But Bernie actually took him left along with AOC plus three, right? AOC plus …

It’s another beauty. She’s the designer of the Green New Deal. She knows nothing about the environment. She probably never studied … Ask her. How many hours have you taken on the environment?

Biden wants to open your borders in the middle of the pandemic. Thank goodness we have that 300 miles of wall because you would have had a problem like you never would’ve seen before. I want strong borders and I want safe communities. If we don’t have borders … I was saying this from day one. If we don’t have borders, we don’t have a country. I imposed a travel ban on jihadist regions to keep terrorists out of our country. And it worked. And it got approved and the press said he failed. And they were right. The lower court failed. Your appeals court failed. And I won at the Supreme court. So they still say it failed because I lost it the first two courts. That’s how dishonest they are. They say he lost because I lost in the first two courts, but we won at the Supreme court. They forget to mention that fact.

Joe Biden has pledged to remove this ban, opening the flood gates to terror and terror hotspots, and increasing the number of refugees allowed into our country by 700%. That’s the manifesto of AOC and Bernie. Joe Biden and Kamala. She’s another beauty. Also strongly support the deadly sanctuary cities that have been so bad for you and everybody else’s. District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala put a drug dealing illegal alien into a job and jobs program instead of into prison. Four months later, the illegal alien robbed a 29 year old woman, mowed her down with an SUV, fracturing her skull and ruining her life. We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.

After eight long years, Joe Biden and Barack Obama left America weak, disrespected, and endangered. We are respected again. We are a respected country again. They said that one of the leaders called up, top top leader of one of the countries. He asked me to call President Erdogan of Turkey, who I get along with very well. He said, “Sir, please, would you do me a favor? Call Erdogan.” I said, “Why can’t you do it?” He says, “You’re the only one he respects. You’re the only person he respects.” I tell you this story. I like telling very personal stories. But they did say that. “You’re the only one he’ll listen to.” I said, “Is that because of the United States?” They said, “No, it’s because of you.” So that’s not so bad. I might as well. I might as well tell you the stories because they won’t.

We’ve invested more than $2 trillion to rebuild our military. Our military is in the best shape it’s ever been and everything is made in the USA. And we revived the historic shipyard in a place called Philadelphia with hundreds and hundreds of new jobs. You know that. And we’ve just launched Space Force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail. Lou, right? I never talked about it. I’m the only one probably that ever ran for office in this country that’s achieved more than I said I would. I never talked about Space Force. I never talked about it. But I realized how important it was and we got it. A sixth branch. Think of that. Sixth branch. That’s a big deal. American rockets are once again sending American astronauts into space. We renewed NASA. It was a field of weeds. A field of weeds. President Obama closed it down. We’re not sending rockets up. And a lot of those rockets are paid by rich people. They like sending up rockets for whatever reason. They like it. I say, go ahead. You can pay us a little rent and you can use our property.

We withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a horror show. The ISIS caliphate was destroyed. The founder and leader of ISIS, the animal known as Al- Baghdadi is dead. The world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. Joe Biden voted for the war in Iraq. I kept us out of new wars. Everyone said, “Oh, Trump, it’s his … He’ll be in a war his first week.” Instead of that, I got you out of wars. We’re down to a minimum number in Iraq. Afghanistan will be down very shortly to 4,000 troops and that’ll come back shortly too. Syria, we took them all out other than where we kept the oil if that’s okay with you. We kept the oil. We have some back and keeping the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq too. Remember, I used to say, “Keep the oil. Don’t go in.” I’d say, “Don’t go into Iraq.” But I was a civilian. Nobody cared. I was like you. So nobody cares.

I want to get that mosquito out of here. I don’t like … They’ll say it’s cruelty to animals. I don’t know. No, it’s true. They were saying the other night, the shark. They were saying, “Oh, sharks. We have to protect them.” I said, “Wait a minute. Wait.” They actually want to remove all the seals in order to save the shark. I said, “Wait, don’t you have it the other way around?” That’s true. I’m not a big fan of sharks either. I don’t know how many votes am I going to lose? I have people calling me up, “Sir, we have a fund to save the shark. It’s called Save the Shark.” I say, “No thank you. I have other things I can contribute to.”

I recognized Israel’s true capital, opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and recognized Israel and its sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else. They talked about it for years. For years and years, many, many presidents talked about the capital of Israel, Jerusalem. And they never did it. I did it. And Golan Heights, 52 years, they’ve been meeting on Golan Heights. I did it. Last week we reached a historic breakthrough in the Middle East, finalizing a groundbreaking agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. People can-

… Israel and the United Arab Emirates. People can’t even believe it. Even the New York Times gave us a great editorial. They can’t even believe it. We passed veterans choice and veterans accountability for our great vets. Nobody’s done for the vets what I have. Nobody. Not even close. We love the vets. And federal workers who failed and mistreated our veterans now can be told, “You’re fired.” That’s accountability. We couldn’t fire them. We had sadists. We had thieves. We had some bad people. They let go of 9,000 people in the VA. They were bad people. They didn’t love our vets. Now they have to love our vets.

In a second term in office we will create 10 million jobs in the next year. We will hire more police. We will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in the rule of law, not the rule of that horrible mob that you get to watch on television. We will provide school choice in every home. We’re going to let you have school choice. That’s a very important thing. The Democrats don’t want anything to do with school choice. We will lower the price of prescription drugs as I said. We will build and expand our energy infrastructure to a level that is even greater than what we have right now, and when I said before we’re number one, we’re number one by a lot, nobody thought we’d ever be number one. And we are energy independent, which is very nice.

As we’ve been doing, we will end our reliance on China and other countries for drugs and other things. We will make our critical drugs, medicines, and supplies, here in the United States. We will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to America, and if they don’t do it, we’ll put tariffs on those companies, and they’ll have to pay us a lot of money. So what are they going to do? They’re going to bring the jobs back.

In every action, every moment, and every decision I’m fighting for you. I’m fighting for Pennsylvania. A lot of people got rich and got powerful at your expense. Now these same liberal hypocrites want to open up borders and let violent mobs rule the streets while they live in Waldorf compounds in communities. They want to defund police while hiring private security. They want to let rioters burn churches while jailing you for praying in your church. They want to abolish school choice while sending their children to the best private schools in the land. They want to cancel you. Totally cancel you. Take your job, turn your family against you for speaking your mind, while they indoctrinate your children with twisted, twisted, worldviews that nobody ever thought possible.

You notice they’re not knocking down statues and monuments anymore because when I saw what was happening I took an old law and I signed a nice new executive order. Then I explained, “10 years, if you knock down a statue, federal statue, or monument.” They were all set to March on Washington. “We’re going to knock down some nice statues,” and then they said, “You know what? Let’s not march.” The march ended very quickly. There was no more marching. They said, “You know, 10 years that’s a long time.” That’s a long time to knock over a statue that many people love and many people don’t. There’s a way of getting it down. You do it through a legal process. It’ll go quickly if it’s right.

Joe Biden is the candidate of these privileged liberal hypocrites who hold you and your values in disdain. But you can send them all a thundering message on election day by voting for Trump-Pence. Do we love our vice president too? Do we love our vice president? I’ll tell you, I watched Kamala last night and I said, “I’ll take Mike.” I’ll take Mike by a lot. He’s been a great vice president actually. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us the Declaration of Independence, Valley Forge, Gettysburg, and generations of American patriots. Just like you. You’re patriots. You love this country. That’s why you’re here. You’re sitting in this boiling, crazy hot, sun. But you’re smarter than me because with you it’s on the back of your head. With me, I’m going to go home and my wife is going to say, “What happened? You look like a lobster.” Look the sun. This is great.

I want to look like Lou, nice and dark. Right Lou? But with Lou it’s a little easier I think. This is the state where workers got their hands dirty mining the coal and forging the steel that raised up the mightiest nation in the history of the world. We’re going to be stronger than ever before. Remember that. We are already. We are going to be stronger than ever before, and that’s happening right now. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and you know this. Look, together we’re taking back our country. But I was just thinking as I said “stronger”, they want to come in and raise your taxes.

They want to come in and put regulations on all of your factories, and all of your jobs, and all of your personal things. You know, little things, and they laugh at it when I say it. The light bulb. Those new expensive light bulbs. I said, “What happened to the old ones? They’re better.” They said, “They were mandated out.” I said, “Why?” Nobody could explain why. I said, ” We’re letting them back. The light bulbs are back.” Dishwashers. They have dishwashers they don’t give you any water. They give you not enough water, so they’re lousy. So what do people do? They press the button again, and again. No water. I let them have lots of water.

We just got back from Whirlpool in Ohio. They’re thriving now because of what I did to competition from other countries. I tariffed them, and Whirlpool now went from a company that was just about over to a company that’s thriving. Sink faucets, shower faucets. I won’t say the third element of the bathroom because they always just bring that up, so I won’t say that but you know what I’m talking about. They don’t allow water. You go into a new hotel. You turn on the water. There’s no water. I opened it up. I said they could have as much water.

I mean does Pennsylvania have a problem with water? No. Yeah you have a problem with water. You have too much of it. Right? You have too much water. You got to get rid of it. So why are we having restrictors? They have restrictors on, so I took it off. These are little things. I tell you about them. A lot of people appreciate them. A lot of people don’t know about it. But now you could go out, buy a light bulb for a tiny fraction of the cost that’s better. Won’t last as long, but it’s better. It’s better light. Makes me look much better. That’s a very important, it’s a very important thing.

But you can buy now faucets where water actually comes out, and so instead of having it like on for many times longer … Actually when I take a shower, I can have water hit my hair instead of drop, drop. It’s hard enough my hair without that. So now we can actually have water pouring out of our shower heads. Okay? So a lot of good things. We’ve done a lot of things that nobody talks about, nobody writes about, but it’s about quality of life, and I think the people really appreciate it. I really do. Not so easy to do. Not so easy to do. I don’t think anybody else could have done it. Nobody else would have thought to do things like that, but nobody else would have done it.

We’re returning power to you the American people from Scranton to Easton. How’s Ernie doing? Good? Huh? How good is Ernie? Right? Right? Is he great? Ernie Holmes? He was heavyweight champ. Right? The champ.
Larry. Larry. Sorry about that. I know another one named Ernie Holmes. Larry Holmes. Is he still in the area of-
How good was Larry? Right? That was probably Muhammad Ali’s most dangerous fight. I’ve never seen anything like it. Mohammad would never go down, but Larry Holmes was a great champion and I know he loved Easton. He used to tell me that, “I want to invest my money in Easton.” I don’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. I hope he’s doing well, but he was one hell of a fighter.

From Scranton to Easton, to Allentown, we’re going to fight for every job, every family, every neighborhood, and every vote. Together we’ll unite citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, as one people, one family, one glorious nation under God. That’s another word they don’t want you to say, God. You know that, right? Did you see they were doing something last night that was extremely basic, and always has had the word God in it, and they decided to take the word God out.

But this is where they’re coming from. They’re coming to get you. This is where they’re coming from. And me, we, we’re the wall between the American dream and total insanity, and the destruction of the greatest country in the history of the world. We’re all that stands. We’re all that stands, and a typical Republican probably wouldn’t get there but I think I’m very Republican in many ways, but your typical Republican would not be able to win.

Like your area. This has always been a Democrat area, and yet the votes for Trump here are through the roof. You know how successful we were four years ago. Incredible. It’s a great area. These are great people. They’re great, hardworking, incredible people, and we love them. With your drive and devotion we will win a historic victory on November 3rd, and we will make America greater than it’s ever been before. I just want to thank the people of Scranton, the lack of home, okay, the lack of home for Joe Biden.

Remember the next time. We’ve got to stop him from saying these things. But you look at … He’s going to make a speech tonight. It’s going to be very interesting to see how he does, and I hope he does well. I’ll be honest. I do. I hope he does well. I really hope he does well, but I also want him to tell the truth. He’s got to tell the truth about things, and he’s going to do a lot better if he does, but hopefully not well enough. Right now we are leading a war that’s incredible. But right now we’re leading in so many polls that they refuse to put out. We’re doing so good in this state, in North Carolina, in Florida, in Texas, in Ohio, in Michigan. You know how many car plants are being built or expanded in Michigan? We’re doing fantastically in Michigan. We’re doing great in New Hampshire.

These are real polls. These aren’t suppression polls. These aren’t polls where they do registered voters. Registered. No. You want to do voters that are going to vote. Registered voters. You want to do what’s called likely voters. Likely. In other words, people that are likely to vote. Not registered voters, many of whom have died, many of whom aren’t going to vote, and then you want to do an even count. You don’t want to do many more Democrats. They do a poll. Right? Many, many Democrats, few, few Republicans. Trump is down by six, and then you look and you say, “Well, if that poll is true, we’re up by 10.” So we’re going to see. You’re going to see. They did it last time. They had me losing every swing state. I think they had me losing like nine states that I won. But he’s going to lose. Right?

You were the first one that told me Lou. He’s going to lose seven swing states. He’s going to lose them all. He’s down by 14. Washington Post-ABC, they had me down one week before the election 12 to 14 points. The day of the election, because we complained that it was a fake poll, so they changed it the day of the election, and they had us just about even. Remember that whole big deal? We said, “You can’t say we’re down because that’s called suppression.” Then you say, “Hey, I love Trump, but I can’t vote for him because I don’t have the time because he’s not going to win.” But if you would have gone out and voted, we would have won. The problem was last time for them, 2016, everybody went out and voted. There was no suppression. There was incredible exhilaration except on the other side that they would not … You ever see those pictures of the craziness going on? But the polls were fake. Just like their stories are fake. Just like the news is fake.

The polls are even worse, and we’re now actually doing worse. One of the most accurate polls was Rasmussen, and Rasmussen came out today. Did you see it? 51 for Trump, 51. I think they were one of the three most accurate polls and the ones that are telling the truth. Sometimes, I mean they have a poll that came out recently that was very favorable, they refused to release it. They didn’t want the people to see it. What kind of stuff is this? That’s why you’re going to do a great job. Right? You’re going to make sure this stuff doesn’t happen, but we’re going to make sure too. So we’re going to win this, and I think we’re going to win it really big. When you see those people outside, and I mean you can take this crowd and multiply it times …

It looks like a hundred. Right? You can multiply it times a hundred, but when you see this crowd, and when you see the kind of enthusiasm, there’s nothing like it. We’re leading by the way, even they admit, we’re leading by enthusiasm by numbers like they’ve never seen before, record numbers. Meaning we have record enthusiasm, and he has a record lack of enthusiasm, and that is a big, big factor. So I just want to thank all of the people from this incredible place. I mean it’s just a great, a great, great place. I’ve been here for so long and so much, and I love it, and I love the people. We’re going to have the biggest victory. We’re going to have a victory that will equal or surpass what we did in 2016. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.",20/8/20
"Thank you very much.
Now if you want to really drive them crazy, you say 12 more years.
Because we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016. Let’s see what happens. We caught them doing some really bad things. We have to be very careful because they’re trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they’re working on, sending them out to people that didn’t ask for them, they didn’t ask, they just get them and it’s not fair and it’s not right and it’s not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion. It’s just my opinion. We have to be very, very careful, and you have to watch. Every one of you, you have to watch. Because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign and that goes to Biden and that goes to Obama and we have to be very, very careful. Have to be very, very careful, and this time they’re trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam. They’ll blame it on the Post Office. You can see them setting it up. Be very careful and watch it very carefully. Because we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. This is the most … For a long period of time, I would say, “Well 2016, how special was that evening? Was that one of the great …” That was one of the great evenings but we have to be very, very careful and we have to win.

Our country is counting on it. This is the biggest, this is it. Our country can go in a horrible, horrible direction or in an even greater direction and before the plague came in from China, that’s where we were going. We were going in a direction like we had never seen. The most successful economy in the history of our country, the best unemployment numbers in history for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, college students, bad students, good students, everybody. If you had a diploma, if you didn’t have a diploma, didn’t matter, you were doing well. Everybody was doing well and we were actually coming together.

You know success brings people together, maybe better than anything else. Success brings people, so many times they say we’re divided. Well we were very divided under President Obama, very divided. People have no idea how divided. They didn’t talk about it as much, they didn’t say it as much, but we were really coming together and I was speaking with Democrats all of a sudden because the success, the markets were at an all-time high and by the way, take a look at what’s happening with the markets. Take a look at your 401k)s which you probably do every hour. Take a look at your stocks. We’re very close to breaking the record and NASDAQ has already done it. You know NASDAQ has broken the record I think 16 times already during a pandemic. Hopefully we’ll call it the final phase of the pandemic.

Biden the other day said no he’d shut it down. He’d listen to some guy say and he’d shut it down. We just broke a record on jobs, an all-time record. There’s never been three months where we’ve put more people to work, over nine million people, and again, we’re just about ready to break the all-time stock market record. I mean you look at it, we’re just about ready to do it again and what that means is everything else is going to follow. Very small on Wall Street. Everything else is going to be there, the economy is coming up very rapidly, our farmers are doing well. Our farmers are doing well because I got China to give them $28 billion because they were targeted by China. I got the farmers $28 billion, 16 and 12. That’s why. So in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and all the difficulties during this period of time, but we’re getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success. Success brings unity and we were there, and then we got hit with the plague but we won’t forget that.

I just want to thank the people of North Carolina because to be honest with you, I felt an obligation to be here. You have a governor is in a total shutdown mood. I guarantee you on November 4 it will all open up, it will be fine like most Southern states. On November 4, you know these Democrat governors, they love shutdown until after the election’s over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible for the economy but our numbers are looking so good and frankly I used to say a V and people would say, “Well maybe not. I don’t think so.” Some would say no way. We have a super V, you’re right. It’s now looking like it’s a super V. Our automobile numbers are incredible, both used cars and brand new cars, our manufacturing number is incredible. We’re putting a lot of manufacturing jobs to work that the previous administration said you’d need a magic wand. You’d need a magic wand for manufacturing jobs, I don’t think so. I guess we had the magic wand, that’s all, but again, we’re putting them back, we’re bringing them back. But think of your life just prior to the plague coming in. It was the best it’s ever been. Your state had the best numbers they’ve ever had, ever had, by far, and we had the best employment numbers also.

We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere near that, and then we had to shut it down. We saved millions and millions of lives. We learned the enemy, we learned all about the invisible enemy, how it affects really people that are older, especially older people, the elderly, but older people with problems with heart and diabetes, with other problems, and we learned and most of the country is right now doing very, very well. They’ve done an incredible job and to have a man sitting on television the other day say, “Oh I’d shut it down. Oh I’d shut it.” Like it’s easy, shut it down. By the way, when you shut it down and we did the exact right thing, we shut it down, then we reopened and that’s what we’re doing now. We’re well into it, but … If we didn’t shut it down at that point, we would have had millions of people dead. Millions of people.

You see the numbers, the job that Mike Pence and the taskforce and all of us together have done has been incredible, what we’ve done, what we’ve achieved, whether it’s ventilators, whether it’s supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared. Many of the governors were totally ill-prepared. Nobody wants to say that but it’s supposed to work that way, federalist, it’s supposed to work that way. The governors are supposed to do it, and many of them did a fine job and many of them came back well. But most of them didn’t have the equipment that they should have had. Few of them had the ventilators which are very, very complex machines and hard to make and hard to manufacture and expensive and we’re right now making thousands of ventilators a month and we’re sending them, we have all we can use, our whole country, every state. We’re stocked, we’re stocked and I always say and I’ll say it again, there’s never been a person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get a ventilator.

Every single person that’s ever needed a ventilator, with all that you’ve heard with how much they said we didn’t have again, I took over a country whose military was depleted and whose cupboard on this front were bare. The cupboards were bare. We didn’t have anything. We didn’t have a thing. We had very, very little and we did a great job. We haven’t been given … And it’s not for me, it’s for the incredible people, the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses and yet you saw yesterday convalescent plasma, you saw remdesivir. You’ll soon see vaccines pouring out years ahead of what they would have been under a more traditional, let’s use that term because it’s nicer, a more traditional administration where they would have taken years to come up with this stuff. We’re coming up with it like nobody’s ever seen before. The FDA, Dr. Hahn I want to thank him, Alex Azar, I want to thank him. They’ve come with things and done things that have never been done in terms of speed and frankly in terms of quality. If you look at it what we’re doing and what we’re coming up with, drug companies are coming up with vaccines that are … I’ve seen some results already, it’s going to be very, very soon. They’re in Stage III trials. It’s unheard of. We wouldn’t be there for two years if this were a more normal situation.

So I just want to thank everybody for being here and again I felt an obligation to come to North Carolina. It’s been a place that’s been very good to me. You know we won a lot of victories here. I haven’t been doing this that long but I won every chance I had in North Carolina. I even stole a great chief of staff, Mark Meadows, right? I stole him from North Carolina, and he left Congress as a very popular guy. Could have been there for a long time if he wanted and he came in and by the way, you have a fantastic young gentleman going to take his place, he’s a fantastic young guy and he’s going to be a real star in the party. He’s going to be a real star in the party.

So I just want to thank everybody from North Carolina and I do want to show a little bit of a difference because another state that’s been very good to me is Wisconsin and Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee and they didn’t go there at all, they didn’t do this. We did this out of respect for your state. We didn’t do this for any other reason other than respect for the state of North Carolina. Because we said we wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina and I think you’re going to remember that frankly on November 3. We wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina. So I did that out of respect, and if you had a governor that would have let us have some people. He actually told me this, we had an arena that holds 19,000 people, it was totally jammed, sold out, every hotel was full, everything, and I called him, he said, “But we have a shutdown going on and according to the rules and regulations …” Now this is 19,000, he did say it. I don’t think he’ll deny it, but he said, “According to the rules and regulations, the most people you’re allowed to have in that room,” meaning that arena, he viewed it as a room, “Is 10 people.”

I say, “So Governor, so I’m at 19,000, you’re at 10. Can we work something in the middle.” It didn’t sound too good, so we really had no choice. It was a terrible thing but I felt so badly because you could have … I mean economic development money, all of the things that happen, but we decided, I was with Ronna, the vice president, everybody, Mark, and we said let’s have our big deal, the roll call, let’s have it right here and let’s do it and I’m going to show up and I’m not going to tell anybody. Until a few minutes ago nobody knew I was coming. Nobody knew I was coming. But what’s more important than the roll call? You’re the ones calling it so what’s more important –
Speaker 4: 12:52)
We love you Mr. President. We love you.

I have to tell you, we’re going to do a lot of things. I’m just going to go over very briefly because we’re going to make a speech on Thursday night, I hope you’re all going to be listening. Because I came in, I’m on Air Force One and Air Force One has more televisions that any plane in history. They’ve got them in closets, they’ve got them on ceilings, floors. They’ve got more … You can’t escape a television, and I turned to CNN and they didn’t have this. They weren’t having it, can you believe it? They didn’t have it. No no, CNN didn’t have our roll call. Then I turned to MSDNC as I call it. MSDNC which is truly, it is a branch of the Democrats. It’s a I wouldn’t say fully owned corporation but it’s certainly a fully controlled or they control them, nobody really knows who’s controlling who but they had it on television. I remember watching it, it was interesting. You see the difference states and we say this and we say that, the great state of Alaska, the great state of Alabama, the great state of North Carolina, the great state of all of them, and it’s very interesting –

… Carolina. The great state of all of them. And it’s very interesting to me. They had theirs on, but they didn’t show it. Instead, they’re showing the scam because they’re trying to show the post office so that when their whole mail-in thing fizzles, they’ll try blaming it on the post office. Okay. So they show in these hearings that are very boring actually and they’re not showing you this either. They weren’t showing this. And Fox had it on, but unfortunately, Fox wasn’t showing it too much because they had the announcers talking, talking, talking. I said, ” I want to hear what they’re saying, the delegates. I want to hear what they’re saying.” So I think we had to switch over to CSPAN or to OAN or somebody. But I wanted to hear them.

But I can promise you a few things. Number one, we will not be taking the word, God, out of The Pledge of Allegiance. Okay. Like they did a number of times at their caucuses, so they took the word God out. I heard it. I was listening and I said, “That’s strange.” It’s sort of weird. You’ve heard it all your life, right? Under God, under God. All of a sudden, those two words are missing. I said, “Oh, he must’ve made a mistake.” Maybe the teleprompter wasn’t working or his book wasn’t working that I have right here. Something wasn’t working. I must admit. But the problem was then the next day I heard it again. And I said, “That’s not a mistake.” And then they immediately went into a mode, “Oh, no, no, no, no. We didn’t mean that. No, no. We didn’t say if for the convention. We didn’t say it.” No, that’s where they’re coming from. That’s where they’re coming from. You can say it or not say it. That is where they’re coming from.

Just like with energy, they don’t want energy. Not working well in Texas, by the way. I just looked at a poll. And by the way, it just came out that we have received 51% in the big and very important Rasmussen poll, and my numbers actually went up during the Democratic National Convention, 51%. So, think of it.
Thank you.
I love this state.
Think of it-
Thank you.
I love this state. I like this place and you’re from all over the place. But this has been a good one for me. No, but think of it, so we’re at 51% in Rasmussen. Do you read about it? Do you hear about it?. You don’t hear about it. They give you these suppression polls, where they do registered voters instead of most likely. It’s supposed to be likely, likely. In other words, how about you, you’re likely to vote. But how about you, you’re registered, but I’m not voting. But see, under their plan where they send these ballots, you don’t have to want to vote. You get the ballot and then they have harvesting. They get guys to go, “Do you want to vote?” “No, not really, but I have a ballot.” “All right, good. Who’s it for?” “Sleepy Joe Biden.” “Now put it here, sign. Okay. Could I have it?” And they’ll take it.

In fact, harvesting is illegal in your state. They wanted to put a Republican, a fine man, a pastor, they wanted to put them in jail because he harvested. Now they want to make harvesting legal all of a sudden. They’ll put him in jail as a Republican, right? If he was a Democrat, they wouldn’t even be thinking about it. In California, they do the same thing. No repercussion. In North Carolina, you had a fine pastor, a fine man, and they got him on harvesting and they wanted to put them in jail. And now they want to make it all so that everybody can harvest because they know it’s not a good thing.

So people that don’t want to vote are going to be sitting there, there’ll be making them … If you talk about 80 million ballots, it’s 80 million, it could even be higher than that. I used to say 51 million, now it’s 80 million. They said, “Sir, you’re a little obsolete with the 50.” I said, “All right, what is it?” “80.” I said, “80.” How is it possible? Think of it, they’ll be sending them, they’ll be dumping them in neighborhoods. People are going to be picking them up. They’ll be bribing. They’ll be paying off people to grab some. This is going to be one of the greatest scams. And it’s common sense. This has nothing to do with politics. It’s common sense. Anybody, you don’t have to know politics, they’re going to mail out 80 million ballots. It’s impossible. They have no idea.

Who’s mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Well, supposing they don’t mail them to Republican neighborhoods. That means they’re not going to get them. So they’re going to complain and the election’s going to be over. And then they’re going to complain. And then they’ll say, “Oh, well, we didn’t get it. Big deal.” In the meantime, you might lose the election. This is the greatest scam in the history of politics, I think, and I’m talking about beyond our nation. And they act like they’re aggrieved. Like by saying this, we’re saying such a horrible thing. We’re not patriotic by saying this. No, we voted during World War I. We voted at the voting booth during World War II. The pandemic, we’re doing very well and people know how to handle it. Look at the crowds. They’re doing very well. It’s very safe. It’s going to be very safe. If you have an absentee ballot where you request it, we’re all in favor of that. Absentee, like in Florida, they have absentee is good.

But other than that, they’re very, very bad. There’ll be millions of ballots. Take a look at New York, take a look at Virginia, take a look at New Jersey, all different cases. They just had one last night. Now they’re thinking about recalling certain elections that took place with mail-in, and these are small elections that are locally based that are easy to run, not millions, but thousands of ballots, thousands, hundreds of ballots. But these are small, and they can’t control it. They said 23% of the ballots were defective. What does defective mean? It means fraud. It means a lot of things that we won’t get into because I don’t want to be accused. You see all the cameras back there. It’s the fake news. I don’t want to be accused of anything. But what it means is they’re trying to steal the election from the Republicans, that’s what it means. In a very, very nice way, I will tell you they are trying to steal the election just like they did it last time with spying and we caught them, and that included President Obama and that included-
Let’s be nice. Biden. This could only happen in North Carolina. But that included them and they got caught. And then somebody said, “Well, what are you going to do?” ” Well, we can attack a president.” Oh, I see. If it was me … They say we can’t attack a president. We caught him. We caught him cold and they say, we can’t attack. He was at meetings talking about it. And by the way, this was spying before and after. And I think it’s a disgrace to our country. I think we can never let that happen again. But now they’re doing something that in a certain way is more dangerous because it’s more effective. They spied on my campaign, you know what they found, nothing. But this is big stuff. This is stealing millions of votes. And it’s going to be very hard.

Now we’re in courts all over the country. And hopefully, we have judges that are going to give it a fair call because if they give it a fair call, we’re going to win this election. The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election. We’re going to win this election.

We’re going to win this election.
I’m just saying we cannot have these live, we call them live, some people call them universal, I like the word live, these live mail-in ballots sent to everybody, including mostly people that never asked for them. Think of it. You’re sitting there, you get a ballot. Here’s the bottom line. It was just given that in the polls believe it or not because the polls try and treat us right. That’s why I respect Rasmussen because they did well. A few of the others feel the same way, and they did well last time. Those are the ones that I look at. The ones that did well last time and Rasmussen was very good.

But if you look at it, every single vote that they have, every single vote it’s going to be looked at. A man is sitting, or a woman is sitting, waiting for nothing, watching television, has no enthusiasm. Because on enthusiasm, the polls are saying that I’m up by massive numbers, not just a little. I’m also way up on the economy, by the way, put at the top. Way, way up. But I’m up by massive, and when I say I’m up, I’m talking about we’re up. Okay. So if you could [ 00:23:10].
But I’m up by massive numbers on enthusiasm. So our voters are saying, “I’m very angry about this. I’ll go to the poll directly and vote.” But that vote is the saying, “I don’t care if Biden gets in.” He doesn’t have any enthusiasm. When you go to Ohio, when you go to Wisconsin, when you go to North Carolina, when you go to a lot of states, they have the Trump-Pence sign on every lawn. It’s all over the place, right? It’s all over.
Indiana too. Indiana is great. Bobby Knight. We love Bobby Knight too. I’ll tell you, we love Bobby Knight and Coach Oates and all of them. They love us. And we love them. Indiana is great. Thank you. But here’s the thing. So if they don’t have any enthusiasm, so you’d say, “Are you going to vote?” “I’m not getting up to vote.” Okay. “I want to watch television instead of vote.” All right. But here’s a ballot. It just got to you. And he opens it. Oh, here’s a ballet. What the hell am I going to do with this thing? And then they have somebody knocking on your door and they’re harvesting. “Hey, have you gotten your ballot?” “Yeah, I have my ballot.” “You going to sign it?” “Well, if you want, I’ll sign it. Here it is. Get out of here.” That’s the most honest way of doing it, and that’s unfair.

That’s unfair because now they’re taking all of that enthusiasm that our party has, and we have tremendous enthusiasm. I think we have record enthusiasm. We have a base the likes of which nobody’s seen, including these people. Wall Street Journal did a fantastic story this weekend, a fantastic cover story this weekend on the base. It’s an incredible base. Everybody here is going to vote everybody in our base. I mean, we have a tremendous base. They don’t. They have no enthusiasm for their candidate. Because frankly, Bernie Sanders, they have much more enthusiasm for him. But Bernie Sanders, excuse me, again, he’s the greatest loser I’ve ever seen. This guy can lose and be so happy. Hillary Clinton, I want to use nice language so I don’t want to a use certain word. It starts with the word S-C. I don’t want to use it because they’ll say he used foul language while in North Carolina. So I won’t do that.

But Bernie Sanders got taken advantage of, is that okay, by Hillary Clinton, but worse by the Democrats this time because of Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren got out of the campaign one day prior to the Super Tuesday vote, Bernie Sanders would have won every single state because Biden won by a little bit. She didn’t do well, but she took thousands and thousands of votes away and he stayed. If you add just a percentage of those votes back, that means that Bernie would have won easily the nomination. And I’m glad he didn’t because he had much more enthusiasm. And he would have had a base, a much smaller base than ours, but equally, I have to say this, equally as enthusiastic. This base doesn’t like Joe Biden. They don’t like Joe Biden. I think we’re going to get a lot of votes. We did last time. People were surprised. Primarily because of trade because I know how other countries take advantage of us, and I understand that, and that’s something that Bernie Sanders people really feel because I understand trade. I’ve done USMCA now. I got rid of NAFTA, the world’s worst [ 00:26:33].
China tariffs. I mean, China had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years prior to the plague. The worst year they’ve had in decades and decades and we had the best year we’ve ever had. But we took in billions from China. We never took in 25 cents from China, never took in 25 cents. China for 25 years, and not only Obama, for 25 years China was taken in anywhere between 200 billion with a B and $550 billion from the United States.

I give them all the credit, number one for being smart and outfoxing all of the people that stood here and their representatives, but China, we built China. We helped build. We gave them three, four, $500 billion a year because before that, and before the World Trade Organization and they getting into it, China was flat line. China was … It was after that happened. And then they took advantage of us because we didn’t have people that were smart enough to see. And by the way, Biden would be the worst of all of them because his son took out one and a half billion dollars and he gets fees on one and a half billion, which is millions of dollars a year. Give me a break. China will own our country if this guy gets elected. We can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen.
So, we have a big one coming.
… So we have a big one coming. And just to finish, enthusiasm. So they take the enthusiasm now out of the equation, because they’re going to go knock on everybody’s door. Here, would you sign this? Yeah, I’ll sign it. Nobody knows who the hell is signing it. And they now want to have it where the signature doesn’t have to be verified. That’s right. The signature doesn’t have to be verified. And then they’re going to play the game that we’re not patriotic. What they’re doing is using COVID to steal an election. They’re using COVID to defraud the American people, all of our people, of a fair and free election. And we can’t do that. And don’t let them give you the Post Office stuff. The Postal Service, they do a great job. Lose a lot of money. I’ve said if they charged Amazon and these companies doing that, a couple of dollars more a package, that Amazon has to pay, not the customer.

You know what happened? Post Office would start doing very well, thank you. Amazon dumps all the packages. Why should we deliver it? We’ll let the Post Office do it and lose a fortune. So if they charged Amazon, now of course, he owns the Washington Post. So when I get bad stories in the Washington Post, I wonder why, right? I wonder why. But I just tell it like it is, right? I tell it like it is. We’ve accomplished more. We’ve accomplished more during the first three and a half years of this administration than any president in the history of our country. And I’m not even getting push back. I’ve been saying this for two years, for three years, I used to say for two years, for three years. But we’ve done more, let’s say just about. This way they can’t say, “Well, somebody won a war, or something.” Right? No, no. We’ve accomplished more than just about any administration in the history of our country. We’ve secured our borders.

We’ve built our wall, which will be finished very shortly. We brought back manufacturing jobs. We’ve defeated the entire… Defeated the ISIS caliphate and killed al-Baghdadi. We also killed the greatest, biggest terrorist maybe of them all, Soleimani. We killed Soleimani, right? And al-Baghdadi. We appointed 300 new judges. By the end of the first term, we will have appointed 300. It’s an unheard of number. That’s because president Obama was very nice and he gave me 142 openings. And historically, you get no open. When you become president. First question, you say, “How many judges?” They’ll say, “None, sir.” Because the other previous president, they want to… It’s a very important thing, federal judges.

We will have appointed 300, could be even more than that by the end of the first term. And I sat down, I said, first day, I said, “How many judges do I get to appoint?” They said, “Sir, 142.” I said, “100…” Because you know what? He thought that Hillary was going to win. Right? And the Republicans did not make it easy, let’s say. But if you have enough time, there’s not much anybody can do about it. We ended up with 142 judges. And now we’ve added many, many, and we’re going to end up with 300 and two great Supreme Court justices.
And remember this, I’m saying that I’m… I’m demanding actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he’s going to appoint. That he’ll take them out, like I did. I had 25 and we’re going to take it out of that list. And we’re going to be announcing a list over the next couple of weeks with the judges that we had, plus we might add a few more. So you know exactly where we stand. He can’t do it, because he would appoint… It’s not him. He has no choice. The radical left will demand that he appoints super radical, left, wild, crazy justices. Going into the Supreme Court, your American dream will be dead if that happens. It’ll be dead. And by the way, the next president… So I’ve had two. Some presidents have had none. I have had to in a relatively short period of time. But I will tell you that the next one could have two, three, four, and even five.

The next president. This is so important. This is so… Whether you’re talking about life, whether you’re talking about second amendment, whether you’re talking about military, this is so important. We have to do this. We have to win this election. But we brought back manufacturing. We rebuilt our military. We wiped out ISIS. I mean, think of it. When I came, ISIS was all over Iraq. The Prime Minister of Iraq was in last week and he said, “I want to thank you for defeating ISIS.” I said, “Now, are you talking about me or the United States?” “You, because when you came into office, it was a mess. They were all over Iraq and Syria, and you defeated them, sir.” I said, “Good. Tell that to the media, please. Would you do that?” And he said, “I will.” So let’s say he does. But we passed the biggest tax cuts and regulations cuts in the history of our country.

We replaced the worst trade deal ever made, NAFTA, with a great USMCA deal, that’s going to keep our companies here and it’s going to be treating us very nicely. And I wouldn’t say the other two countries were thrilled with it, but they were happy enough. And we did that. And that’s another thing, they said, “You’ll never be able to replace NAFTA. You’ll never be able to get it.” And I got it. We got it through Congress. We fixed a lot of our broken and bad trade deals. We’re getting 40 billion now from Japan. We fixed a horrible deal that was made with South Korea. Remember, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, “This will produce 250,000 jobs.” And she was right. Except unfortunately, the jobs went to South Korea, not to us. She said it would produce 250,000 jobs. And it did, to South Korea. And we stood up to China like nobody’s ever stood up. Between the tariffs and the trade deal, which now… Don’t forget, when I made that the ink wasn’t dry before the China virus poured into our country, right?

The ink wasn’t dry. So I view that differently than I would have, because it’s done very well. In the last week they had the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans. They are doing things… They’re very smart. A lot of people, because they see my attitude. A lot of people would say, “We’re not going to order.” They do just the opposite. I got a call last week, “Sir…” In fact, Sonny Purdue is here. The great Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. There he is. Is that right, Sonny? I got a call. They ordered the largest, it was the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Twice. Twice. The largest order of corn. The largest order of soybeans.

Here’s how smart, somebody else would say, running some country. They’d say, “Well, we’re not going to do business with him. He’s not saying nice things about…” China’s very smart. Instead, they order more corn than we’ve ever thought possible. Right, Sonny? Order more soybeans than we ever thought possible. And now I have farmers calling me up, “Sir, we love China very much. Please don’t be too tough on them.” It makes it very difficult, Sonny, right? We do too good a job sometimes. We’ve achieved American energy independence. And we’re now number one in the world, by far.

And I saw where these phonies, you know they want to end everything we’ve done. They want to end it. They want to go to wind. They don’t even know if they want to go to wind. I think they want to just basically close up our country, because they’ve taken away our strength, but they want to do something. But, there is no such thing. Solar can’t do it. I love solar. It’s all fine. Very, very heavily expensive. Very expensive. But they want to go to other forms of alternative energy. And I think that’s okay, except we don’t have them. And it’s not going to power these massive factories.
And hydro, I love. It’s one of my all time favorites. Hydro, I love. I have to tell you. That’s the Great Dams. You don’t see that too much. You know why? The environmentalist say, “You can’t build a dam there.” But now we can, because we’ve done-
We’ve done things that nobody thought were possible. Like example, the Keystone pipeline. We got that approved. The Dakota Access pipeline. They were all bogged down, right? Right? We’ve got things that they said you couldn’t get done. We’re energy independence. And they said, “We want to ban fracking.” No fracking. How do you think they’ll do in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota? Louisiana is going to love it. There’s no fracking. There’s basically… They want no fossil fuel whatsoever. Okay? No gas, no oil, no coal. No nothing. Okay.

So they don’t want anything. Now, they’re getting killed. Because a poll just came out in Texas. Texas wasn’t happy. They want no guns. They want no oil and gas. And they want no God. No God. It’s no religion, no guns, no oil and gas. I don’t think you’re going to do too good in Texas. George Washington could come back from the dead and he could choose as his VP candidate, the late great Abraham Lincoln. And you’re not going to win the state of Texas if you have no oil, no guns and no religion. I don’t think so.
Audience: 38:07)
Nice work!

I don’t think so. You’re not going to win too many places. We eliminated Obamacare’s horrible and very unfair individual mandate, which basically knocked out Obamacare. We knocked out Obamacare. We’ve protected your second amendment. So important. We’re protected the second amendment. We’ve cut drug prices, first time in 51 years, we got drug prices down. Now, I’m really doing it. I did a favored nations clause. Meaning, we pay the same price as the lowest country that has the best deal. The companies are going crazy. The drug companies. They’re taking ads on me. I said… I went to Mark Meadows. I said, “Mark, they’re killing me.” They have nothing but cash. Okay? Big pharma, they call it for a reason. There’s nobody that gives the politicians more money than big pharma. Nobody. Not even close. So I said, “Well look, if you’re not going to negotiate a fair deal, we’re going to do a favored nations clause.” To the top people, the biggest guys.

They said, “No, don’t do that, favored nations.” Favored nations, because you know, we have countries out there that are paying a tiny fraction of what our people are expected to pay. So if you have a country, Germany or others, they make… By the way, UK, all of Europe, Canada pays 50%, 5-0. 50% less. In fact, people leave our country, go to Canada, and pick up their drugs and they come back home. Can you believe that? This is the kind of difference. So I said, “No, I want a favored nations clause. I also want a rebate clause.” A rebate, where instead of the money going to the middleman, who have to be the richest people in the world. They get so much. They get more money, frankly, than the drug companies. At least the drug companies make a product. So I wiped out the rebate, where now it goes to people. And I instituted what’s called a favored nations clause.

And it’s very simple. You have that in deals. It’s whatever the lowest price in the world, we’re the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. So whatever the lowest price is that other countries pay. So if you have a country paying 25 cents for a pill and we’re paying $2.50 cents, and it’s not such an exaggeration, believe me, then we get it for 10. So what happens is that doesn’t work. So they’ll go up a little bit. We’ll come way, way down. So I said, “Favored nations. I want to pay what the lowest price is anywhere in the world. We’re the biggest purchaser, we want a favored nations.”

They had a heart attack. And then I signed it. They didn’t believe it. And now what they’re doing is they have ads, millions and millions of dollars worth of ads, that I’ve been horrible to the people because of drugs. And I believe in socialism. Socialism. You know why? Because some of the socialistic countries get the lowest price. So the only thing I have with socialism is I wanted to get their price. Okay. That’s the only thing. Other than that is our country will never be a socialist country.
So we cut drug crisis. And you could get cuts. You could get cuts.
You could get cuts as much as 50, 60 or 70%, maybe even more than that, on prescription drug prices. And wouldn’t it be a kick… I’ll use this, wouldn’t it be a kick in the ass if I lost and sleepy Joe is president, and this thing kicks in right about soon, right? In 30, 40 days. And people wake up after the election. Boy, Biden’s done a great job. My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great-

My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great president he’s been. He’s great. And sleepy Joe would say, I thought about that, but everybody knew about favorite nations, but nobody had the guts to do it. And I’ll tell you, I was called by many politicians, please don’t do it, sir. Please. I said, “why?” They don’t want to tell me why. I know why. Because they’re politicians and they’ve been helped out and I guess we have to understand that too. But the fact is that we signed a favorite nations clause and a rebate clause, and your numbers are going to come down 60, 70%. And I hope you remember that on November 3rd, because nobody but me would ever do it.
 
The other thing I’ve done aside from very strongly protecting your Second Amendment, which was not easy. That was not easy. And by the way, they will take your guns away as sure as you’re standing or sitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and you see how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic they let them riot every night. We’re saying, let us come in and solve your problem. We will solve it for you in one hour just like we did in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right? Five nights, six nights, they have to ask us in. Let us come in. We’ll solve your problem.
 
They’re almost used to it. This is the way our whole country would be if you ever let a thing like this happen, our whole country would be. So we protected your preexisting conditions, very strongly protected… and you don’t hear that. But we very strongly protected your preexisting condition. So we got rid of the horrible individual mandate, which cost everybody a fortune and we strongly protected. Every Republican is sworn to protecting your pre existing conditions. It’s very important. You won’t hear that. You won’t hear that from the fake news. We passed Right to Try. We passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. We mobilized the largest response since the Second World War. We are doing an incredible job on the China virus, but I’m going to talk to you about that Thursday night. Will anybody be listening on Thursday night?

And just very quickly, in the second term among many other things, we’ll continue with our military. We built the strongest military by far. It was depleted. A nice Marine back there. It was depleted like you wouldn’t believe. We have the best jets and rockets and equipment of any kind, tanks. Tanks made in Ohio. Lima. Tanks made in Ohio. So we’re going to create 10 million jobs, I think very easily, in the first 10 months. They want to raise your taxes. All my life I’ve heard as a politician, you like to lower taxes, right? This is the only election where somebody said we’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your taxes, quadruple your taxes. They’re going to add on to the regulations. There all of these projects that we got started that are great projects, they won’t be able to get built.

So they’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your regulations, make it impossible to build a highway. It used to take 17 years, 18 years, 20 years, 21 years, long time in some cases, to get approval to build a highway, right? We have it down to two years now, we’re going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we’re going to know it very quickly. We’re not going to take 17 years. We could name highways. They took forever. End up costing a hundred times more and they’re not as good. Some of them go in circles, I mean, to get to a point. They want to [ 00:03:44]. Let’s spend 37 million to… look, we’ve got to be smart. Got to be smart. We’ve got to win an election. Also, we’re going to create tax credits for companies that bring our jobs back from China and other countries and impose tariffs on countries that take advantage of the United States.

They’ve been taking advantage of us for years and years, and I’ve already done it in certain cases. We have countries that tariff us and we don’t tariff them. So they tariff us. It’s very simple. It’s called reciprocal. They tariff us, we tariff them. We are going to fully fund law enforcement and hire more police. We’re going to go with school choice and we’ve made a lot of progress on school choice for every student in America. We’re going to continue to expand opportunities zones. There has been nothing better. Don’t forget. It was us, us together that got criminal justice reform done. The greatest thing for the black community, African American community. They came and they said, “We can’t believe it. Obama didn’t even try.” And not only that, I got funded, the historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They weren’t funded. They were year to year. They didn’t know if they were going to be around for another year and they’d come in to the White House.

And after three years, I said, “Why do you guys keep coming back?” Well, it’s a year to your deal. I said, “That’s not fair. So you have to come back every year.” And we got them longterm financing and longterm funding. Nobody’s done more for the historically black colleges and universities than Donald Trump. Nobody. Nobody’s done more for the African American community. No president has done as much as anybody since, I mean, since, and I say it, since Abraham Lincoln. It’s true. It’s true. Criminal justice reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. He’s a great senator, he’s a great gentleman. Tim Scott is fantastic. Opportunities zones. But think of it, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, the colleges and universities. What we’ve done has been amazing. But the most important thing is prior to the virus, the greatest job numbers in the history of the African American community, the Hispanic community and the Asian, as I said. So I just want to thank everybody. We’re going to get rid of our sanctuary cities as soon as we can so that they don’t protect.

We put NASA back in action. NASA had grass growing through its runway. It had grass growing through the cracks of its runways. It was closed, essentially, just a disaster. Now it’s the number one space center anywhere in the world by far. You saw the ships going up. And for some reason, a lot of rich people like rockets going up. And so we say, let’s lease them our beautiful launching areas and let them send all the rockets, let them pay for it. But we’ll be landing on Mars. We’re going to the moon. We’re go into Mars. We’ll be the first on Mars. Let’s see if that happens. We have to do it. If we hear it’s going to happen. If somebody else is here, you’re probably not. But I just want to, again, thank… I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You’re incredible warriors. You have incredible strength. You have unbelievable intelligence and patience. It’s a combination of both. I don’t know which is greater, the intelligence or the patience, but let’s assume it’s the intelligence. But I have to tell you, I think we have the greatest base of support anywhere at any time, any election and people are starting to find that out. They found it out in 2016. And I will be honest, this election, I believe we have far greater enthusiasm in this election. And we had a level that was a record because they still don’t believe what happened. They said, “Where are all these people coming from?” Right? People that were great Americans that never voted, because they didn’t like who they were watching or looking. People were great, they didn’t vote. I’ll never forget, a Congressman from Tennessee came up. They do very early voting. Tennessee, a great state. And they had just started voting. And I was in Pennsylvania making a speech.

And he said, “Sir, I don’t know. I can’t speak for anybody, but I’m from Tennessee and I’ve been doing this for a long time.” He said, “I’ve never seen anything like it. People are coming from the valleys and the hilltops. And they’re coming from the cities. They’re coming from all over. I never say, they’re coming out of the rivers. They’re coming along those beautiful war fields that we have. They’re coming from everywhere, sir. I’ve never seen anything like it.” But if other States are like Tennessee, you’re going to win this election. He was the first one to say it. He was the first one. They came from the mountains. They came from everywhere. He said, “I’ve never seen anything like it.” And people they’d be having Trump pins and the hats. These are people that never were political people. They never wore a pin in their life having to do with politics. It’s been an incredible experience for me. It’s been an incredible experience, I think, for everyone. And I’ll tell you what, next year is going to be an incredible… it’s going to be a great, great year.

It’s going to be a year of tremendous success. We’re fighting off this horrible thing that was delivered by China. And it was by China and we’re never going to forget it and I let them know. We’re never going to forget what they did because you know what? We’re going to do great economics [ 00:51:42] best year in the history of your state, but we’re going to do better economically than we did last year. But we can never forget the 175,000 people, which will go up. Remember this though, we saved millions because if we didn’t move and if I didn’t put the ban on highly heavily infected people coming to our nation from China, that everybody told me not to do. Months later, they were saying we shouldn’t… and then they all either apologized or admitted it was right. And Europe. I did Europe too, very early. If we didn’t do that, our numbers would be at a level like you wouldn’t believe.

So, I just want to thank everybody for this incredible support. Be very, very careful. This is going to be, and I really believe this. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Don’t let them take it away from you. Don’t let them take it away. North Carolina, we love you. That’s why I’m here. Thank you very much. Very special people. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you.",24/8/20
"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests, please. I stand before you tonight honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years and blooming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years.

We begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago.

And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. And congratulations, thank you for that great job out there. We really appreciate it. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love, and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy.

For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent first lady. Thank you sweetheart. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children. Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you. And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother, and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert.

Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values, a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our vice president, Mike Pence. And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you, Karen.

My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States.

The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.

In the new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach four new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country.

Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the people’s house, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story.

This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like President Grant and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to chart our continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument and asked God and his Providence to save our nation. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on course to victory in the Second World War.

In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner. We will defeat the virus and the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before.

What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America’s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country is blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny, and communism.

This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and has lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country.

Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide if we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has been foolishly done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists, and agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens.

And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. That won’t happen. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a simple question, how can the Democratic Party ask to lead our country when it spent so much time tearing down our country?

In the Left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on Earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we do not turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in almighty God.

Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul. He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of America’s greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs, and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain, and then he flew back to Washington, and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended.

Four years ago, I ran for president because I cannot watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do. Thank you.

From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class, and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You have seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, “America first.” Thank you. Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, ended the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American energy independence.

We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest-hitting action against China in American history by far.

They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA, but again they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new Mexico-US-Canada agreement into law. And right now, auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries.

In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down, and today America’s borders are more secure than ever before. Thank you. We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20000 gang members and 500000 criminal aliens. We have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.

We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union, representing our country’s courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people. You see, this country loves our law enforcement. They do. They really do. Love and respect.

When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the chairman of the board. And now those talented American workers have been rehired, and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot. Please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been through a lot. Thank you very much.

Last month, I took on big pharma. You think that’s easy? It’s not. And signed orders that would massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures. We passed the decades-long-awaited right to try. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice, our great veterans, we’re taking care of our veterans. 91% approval rating this month, the VA given by our veterans. First time anything like that has ever happened.

By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court justices.
And to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and long-term funding of historically Black colleges and universities. And before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. And I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. And I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. And when I am re-elected, the best is yet to come.
Thank you very much.

When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel’s true capital, and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned, existing building in a better location. Real estate deal, right? And opened it at a cost of less than $500000. Many things like that the government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. Thank you to the UAE. Thank you to Israel. In addition, we obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, and killed its founder and leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number-one terrorist by far, Qassim Suleimani.
Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America out of new wars, and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States Military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.

We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states. They did not want to hear Biden’s hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back.

As vice president, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I’ve reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission that took out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Suleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That is why China supports Joe Biden, and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information.

China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude.

Many Americans, including me, I have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary. In their honor, we unite. In their memory, we will overcome it. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, invoking the Defense Production Act. We produce the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. Good job heading the task force by our great vice president. Thank you very much, Mike. Please stand up.

We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves, and gowns to our frontline health care workers. To protect our nation’s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes. We gave everything you can possibly give, and we’re still giving it because we are taking care of our senior citizens. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined, think of that. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that? On Sunday night when we announced it. That will save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rates. And you look at it, and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80% since April. 80%.

The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don’t hear that. They do not write about that. They don’t want to write about that. They do not want you to know those things. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that.

We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That’s one of the reasons that we’re advancing so rapidly with our economy. Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over nine million jobs, and that’s a record in the history of our country.

Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe called it hysterical and xenophobic. And then I introduced a ban on Europe, very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation’s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds. The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss, and much more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it’s a surrender to the virus.

My administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts, and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. And we want to see so many of those great states be opened by Democrats. We want them to be open. They have to be open. They have to get back to work. They have to get back to work, and they have to get back to school.

Most importantly, we are marshaling America’s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. Nobody thought it could be done this fast. Normally it would be years, and we did it in a matter of a few months. We are producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus.

At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that is not because they don’t have one. It is because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light. But when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. He doesn’t have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which would totally collapse our rapidly improving economy, and once again record stock markets that we have right now, will also collapse. That means your 401k)s, that means all of the stocks that you have.

On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads. I will not raise taxes, I will cut them, and very substantially. And we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China, back to America. And we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing for quite some time if you’ve noticed. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA.

Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas, laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, destroying those states, absolutely destroying those states and others. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. Everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody’s seen anything like it, but we saw it last week in California. How can Joe Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can’t even keep the lights on?

Joe Biden’s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform. You can’t get away from this, co-authored with far-left senator, crazy Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie manifesto[ calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch-and-release, and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer. Come over to our country, everybody has a lawyer. We have a lawyer for you. That’s all we need, is more lawyers.

Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage, and promised he was going to give it away your health care dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring massive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all the goodies that they want to give. Education, health care, everything. He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the manifesto. The Biden plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic. And he is even talking about taking the wall down. How about that?

Biden also vowed to oppose school choice, and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term, I will expand charter schools, and provide school choice to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. Great people. Great, great people.

Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies, right up until the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul. Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.

During the Democrat convention, the words, under God, were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance. Not once, but twice. We will never do that. But the fact is, this is where they’re coming from. Like it or not, this is where they’re coming from. If the Left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there are many. We see them all the time. It is incredible, actually. Then how is he ever going to stand up for you? He’s not.

The most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department, “A cancer that is rotten to the root,” Biden would not disavow her support and reject her endorsement. He proudly displayed it shortly later on his website, displayed it in big letters.

Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the Radical Left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.

One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American heroes called the NYPD, or New York’s finest, who I was very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. If they were allowed to do their job, you’d have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy. Three years ago on the Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight, and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids.

Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children, and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss. And we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that’s the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous, and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs. And by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you. And those who suffer most are the great people who they protect, and who they want to protect at an even higher level. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule.

In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all, like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York, and many others, Democrat-run. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. Just call, we’re ready to go in. We will take care of your problem in a matter of hours. Just call. We have to wait for the call. It is too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside, I signed an order immediately, 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle. It all stopped. No more statues. They said, “That’s just too long,” as they looked at a statue. “I think we’ll rip it down.” Then they said, “10 years in prison? I think that is too long. Let’s go home.”

During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they are starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. It is too late, Joe. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bailout vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail.

Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain, David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protesters. They call them peaceful protesters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members, Brian and Kielen. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain. David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Great man.

As long as I am president, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that is up to them. But I as your president, will not be part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.

Last year, over 1000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victim and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the Left ignore these American victims. I never will. If the radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every town, city, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US government. Just think of that.

Liberal politician’s claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who exactly is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by Radical Left. Always remember, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. That is what is happening. And it has been going on from before I even got elected. And remember this, they spied on my campaign, and they got caught. Let’s see now what happens.

We must reclaim our independence from the Left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted, trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of Cancel Culture is to make Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true. Very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget.

Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing from the scene of the wreckage. The same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children into the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled off compounds and communities and the best neighborhoods in the world. They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is, I am here.

What is the name of that building? But I’ll say it differently, the fact is, we are here and they are not. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world is not a building, it is a home, as far as I am concerned. It’s not even a house, it is a home. It’s a wonderful place with an incredible history. But it is all because of you. Together, we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains. And we will end our resilience for banned things. We will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We are taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home.

We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months. And it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities, and ensure federal health care is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens.

We will have strong borders. And I’ve said for years, without borders, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don’t win, your Second Amendment doesn’t have a chance. I can tell you that. I have totally protected it.

We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. They are coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number-one in the world, and keep America energy independent. And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is. You haven’t seen that in a long time.

We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect. We will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in, if they do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it is amazing how open they have been lately.

We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars. This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight, I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now.

Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Our country wasn’t built by Cancel Culture, speech codes, and crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American patriots. We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers, and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down, held back, or in any way reigned in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on Earth.

I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money. They didn’t have fame. But they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers. They pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier. Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon, they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were.

Americans build their future, we don’t tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are.

Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets, and bayonets to rescue American liberty. They had no fear. But America did not stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a six-million-pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible.

Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights, and we will show that the world for America there is a dream, and it is not beyond your reach. Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America.

On November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before. I am very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party.

I love you all. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.",27/8/20

Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. Wow. Hello, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. And I’ll tell you, we’re landing and there are thousands of people along the runways, and I said, “Why aren’t they here?” “Sir, we couldn’t let them in.” “Why not? Let’s let them in.” Oh, these people. And then they put in a floor. This is for Manchester because you know about flooring. They put in a floor that’s like an ice skating rink. So we’re going to tiptoe around.

How are you, everybody? We love you. We love you. Great, great people. Manchester, we had some good memories in Manchester. 2016, but this is going to be, we are right now in the most important election in our history. But I’m thrilled to be back in the Granite State with the true hard-working American Patriots. Last night it was my great honor to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States.

We’re going to win. We’re going to win. Does anybody have any doubt? Does anybody… It’s very interesting, last night we had an incredible time and I don’t know if you know, it’s driving the fake news crazy. They’re back. But the poll numbers have swung. If you go back six months before the plague flew in from China, the plague, the horrible plague, this election was over. This election was over. And then I had to go back to work. I had to go back to work. And then I went back to work and we’ve done an incredible job in every aspect of running government, but I also had to start campaigning a little bit again, and I did.

And today it was announced that Joe Biden is coming out of the basement. Because the poll numbers have totally swung. They totally swung. And they’ve swung like nobody’s ever seen them swing before. And it was rapid. It was a rapid swing. Because they all admit that we’re doing a great job. There’s not too many presidents that have done a job like we’ve done, including keeping you out of wars, bringing you home from the endless wars. But they’ve swung.

But here’s what I don’t get. Sleepy Joe’s coming out he said in 10 days, that’s a long… 10 days. 10 days. That’s like an eternity in Trumpville. 10 days. I view 10 days is like an eternity, okay? So he decided he’s coming out and he’s going to be out in 10 days. That’s a long time. That’s a big percentage of the remaining time. That’s all right, he’s much better off where he is. I think he’s, I think he just…

We love Melania, we do. She did a great job. Did a great job. She did a great job. She went up on Tuesday night, did an incredible job. Last night was exciting, wasn’t it? [  00:17:31].

And how about those stories from friends of mine? How about those stories? Was that just compelling and incredible television, but really that was an exciting, a really good quality convention. Really great. So many people. So many people, you saw some tragic situations, some really great endorsements, you saw everything. If you… How about the endorsement of Herschel Walker? When you watch that that was from the heart. That was from the heart. Dana White today. I just saw it today because last night I was looking at this speech a little bit. We had a wonderful turnout last night.

What I didn’t like, you saw this right, when it was over, you saw when it was over? The thugs outside because the Democratic mayor of Washington DC, it’s another Democrat that’s not believing in law and order. And you know we give Washington DC a lot of money to run it, but they don’t do a good job of running it. The mayor, she doesn’t run anything. And these incredible people from all over the country, all over the world that were there last night, they walked out to a bunch of thugs. And that wasn’t, remember this, that wasn’t friendly protesters. They were thugs. They were thugs. And the DC police are good, but the mayor gave bad instructions last night, that should have never been allowed to happen.

When a senator like Rand Paul walks out, and thank God we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous… They took tremendous abuse. And Rand Paul was in big trouble last night, he’s a good guy, he’s a friend of mine, and that shouldn’t happen to anybody. But he is a US senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the White House and we ought to give them a medal of some kind, and we’re going to do it. We’re going to do it. I told that to Rand. And the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that’s what’s happening in Portland. And that’s what’s happening all over where you have Democrat-run cities. Just take a look. And we’re looking at the whole situation in DC, and tonight they have a lot of people gathering, let’s see how that works out. They have to be able to manage their affairs, they get a lot of money. She’s always looking for money, “Could we have more money?” “What are you going to waste it on? I mean spend it on. What are you going to waste it on, Mayor?”

And then our people walk out, and these are people from all over the world, they walk, including Congress, by the way, they walk out and they get accosted, they get abused, they get spit on. It’s a disgrace. And our country is going to change. We’re not going to allow that to happen. You know, we’re not supposed to be… We’re not supposed to be involved unless we’re invited in by the people that run, these are all Democrat cities, just so you understand, including DC. So we’re not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, but that’s a big statement. It’s a big statement. No reason for it. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to have to look at it. Mark Meadows is here, we’re going to have to look at it because we’re not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country.

And a weak guy named Joe Biden, and he’s weak, he’s weak as hell, a weak guy like Joe Biden didn’t even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire Democrat National Convention. Now they’re all of a sudden… Now they realize because they’ve gone down like a rock in water, they’ve gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden they’re talking all, “Well, we have to talk about crime.” Number one, they have no… Look at what happened to New York, look at what’s going on in Chicago, all Democrats, all radical left Democrats. Look at what’s going on in the great State of Wisconsin. Now I will tell you, two days ago we sent in the National Guard. That was the end of that problem.

Look at Portland. We want to send in the National Guard, we sent in Homeland Security just to protect our… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse, can you believe it? We sent in because-

… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse. Can you believe it? We send in because they can’t protect it. So we sent, they did a very effective job. We could take care of Portland in 45 minutes, 45 minutes. If that governor, if that mayor would call and say, “Please send in the National Guard.” just like … Hey, we did it in Minneapolis. Remember that? The place was going to burn down. Another few days, we send in the National Guard, it was over within an hour. They ought to get smart and that’s what they ought to do.

So now they’re talking about, “Well, we want to …” Why did they call it a friendly protest? Right? Remember the idiot from CNN, he’s standing there. This is a friendly protest. Behind him over his shoulders, the entire city is burning down. Sixty seven days from now, we’re going to win the great state of New Hampshire. We have to. We’re going to win four more years in the White House.

Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.

Within my first term in office, we’ve secured America’s borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the United States military. It was a mess. It was a depleted mess. Wiped out the ISIS caliphate, killed our terrorists enemies, kept America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. Achieved American energy independence. You see the price of your gasoline. When you go fill it up, “Oh boy, that’s a nice price.” It’s half what it was. We built the single greatest economy in the history of the world. That includes China, which was having a very, very bad year. Then the plague came in from China. We had to close it up.

We saved millions of lives and now we’re open again and we’re setting records. We’re setting records. Wait till you see the numbers just before the election. There’ll be released and this is despite the fact that the Democrats are holding back Michigan, North Carolina. You take a look. Pennsylvania. They want to keep them. By the way, on November 4th, regardless, they’ll be opening them up, November 4th, because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me, but our numbers are going to be great. We’re going to have a great third quarter. We’re going to have an unbelievable next year, unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes.

This November, each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country. I used to say it about 2016. This is now at a new level. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment, which will have no chance. Your vote will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow Biden to eliminate your jobs. By the way, it’s not Biden. It’s not Biden.

It’s his masters, his … They tell him what to do, his masters. They want to erase your borders, confiscate your guns, appoint radical left judges and prosecutors, tear down our history. Demolish your suburbs. You saw what I did. I ended the rule. You’re not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore, but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn’t want to write that, but everyone knows. Unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be, they know that. They want to destroy your suburbs, indoctrinate our children, defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like Portland, Oregon than what we’re used to looking at. Never forget, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. It’s true.

Today’s Democrat party is filled with hate. Just look at Joe Biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage. Right? You see it. It’s crazy. It’s crazy. You ought to see last night in Washington. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace that these people are representing the United States of America. It was a disgrace. Protesters. You know what I say? Protest is your ass. I don’t talk about my ass.

They’re not protestors. Those aren’t … Those are anarchists. They’re agitators. They’re rioters. They’re looters. They’re not … You know you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there, “Oh, how dare you. These are friendly protesters, right?” Friendly …

They’re just looking for trouble. Has nothing to do with George Floyd. Has nothing to do with anything. They don’t even know who George Floyd is. Okay? They don’t know who George Floyd. They have no idea. If you ask them, “Who’s George Floyd?” They couldn’t even tell you. These are just bad people, troublemakers and they shouldn’t be representing our country at important events and we’ve got to stop it. Democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals, marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations, but they don’t believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together. You can’t go to church anymore.

You know how many churches are closed in this country because of the Democrats? You can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets, threatening other people, beyond threatening, kicking them in the face, doing what they’ve done. You’ve seen it. They would have done that to Senator Rand Paul last night. He’d either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn’t happen to be there. They took some big beating. The reason they didn’t fight back too much, they don’t want to lose their pension. They don’t want to lose their job, because we’ve become so politically correct, everybody’s afraid to do anything now, but they did a good job.

The puppet Biden, who’s just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings, funerals and school, but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets, mugging people, hurting people, robbing stores, looting stores, burning down storefronts. The radical left will do anything to get power. They smear justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and they are … Did you see anything like that? Justice Kavanaugh. People forget. Time goes by, they forget. We don’t forget. I don’t forget. They’re destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if Biden wins, which I honestly can’t believe can happen.

I will have lost to a low IQ individual. I don’t want that. I don’t want it. Sleepy Joe, I don’t want it. But the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government. Can you believe it? The levers, they call it the levers of government. The top 10 most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrats and have been for decades. Now they’re trying to impose those policies across the entire country. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. I can’t even call it Biden’s America. God doesn’t know he’s alive. He’s going to be out in 10 days. He’s going to start 10 days. Ten days.

I mean, I gave a big speech last night. I said, “What am I doing tomorrow night?” You’re going to New Hampshire, but sir, we can cancel New Hampshire because you had a big night. We can cancel. Are you crazy? I don’t have the courage to cancel New Hampshire. I got to win New Hampshire. I love the people and you’ve been very good to me. You’ve been very good to me.
You’ve been very good to me. So, New Hampshire was the first state I won. Right? Remember, I came here. I was very excited. That was an exciting evening. That was an exciting race, but we don’t talk about that anymore. We have to talk about the future. We don’t talk about it. That was great. It was important. We’ve done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country. That’s despite phony witch hunts, phony investigations, a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect. That’s despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by China, who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world, because China does not want to see me win I can tell you that. We’re not happy with China. I’ll tell you why. If Biden got in, China would own the United States very quickly. They’d own it. If the Democrat party wants to stand with anarchist, criminals, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that’s up to them. The Republican party and you, I can see you. Is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the American flag? Is there anybody?
Please quietly raise your hand. Be careful. Could be very dangerous. The Republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and our law enforcement. Right? We are all that stand between the American people and the left wing mob. If you want to save democracy from the mob, then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate. Look, I believe I have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the Democratic party, the worst. How do you get worse? I believe he’s the worst candidate, the slowest candidate. I mean, in prime time, he was the slowest candidate, which was a long time ago. Primetime. You know what I don’t like though, they say he’s like 78, 79, 78, I guess. Right? I know people that are 85, that are 88, 92, Bernie Marcus, Home Depot, he’s 92 years old. He’s the sharpest guy you’ll ever meet. There’s nothing … 78 is okay, but that’s a bad 78, not a good 78. 78 is okay, but he shouldn’t say that. They shouldn’t say … The press, they say he’s too old. He’s not too old. He’s not too old, but 78 is okay, but I do. I know people in their 90s that are 100% sharp and good physically, actually good physically. You want debate? So do I. I want debates too. I want debates too.

Tonight, we’re honored to be joined by New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Where is Dick? I think your great governor is here. Where’s the governor? Where’s our governor? Hi, Dick. Good job. Do we like Dick? Yes. Where’s our governor? He’s here. He just met me. I told him, “Go back.” Hi, Steve. Because you have a great governor and we don’t have same day voting anymore. We don’t have same day. What a joke that was last time, remember? Buses poured up from Massachusetts with a lot of people that weren’t going to vote for Trump, and they poured up thousands and thousands of people came in on election day and then you had a senator running on the Republican party who wasn’t exactly the greatest for us, but we have done so well here and we’re going to have a big win. I’m hearing we’re going to have a great win. So, I want to thank you, governor.

Also with us, our state representatives, Al Baldasaro and Fred Doucette. Where are you? Hi. Hi, Al. I know these guys so well. Hey Al, have I taken care of the vets better than you even thought?
This guy I met him. He’s a big vet. He wanted the vets. He didn’t care about anything else, but the vets. Honestly, he couldn’t have cared less about anybody here except the vets, but I did a good job, right? We did a good job for the vets. Very importantly, very, very US Senate candidate Corky Messner. Good, Corky. I hear you’re doing well. Good, Corky. Get them. We need Corky. Get them. I hear you’re doing well, Corky.

Congressional candidate Matt Mowers. Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Great people. A friend of mine for a long time, he said right from the beginning, “You’re going to win this state, sir.” We met him at the primaries. Chairman of New Hampshire Republican Party Steven Stepanek. Steven. Hi, Steve. Great Steve. Co-chairman of my New Hampshire campaign Lou Gargiulo. Where’s Lou? Lou Gargiulo. Hi, Lou. How am I doing? Are we winning, Lou? Lou, are we winning? Thank you. You said yes. If he said no, he’s out of here.

A friend of mine and a friend of the state, he loves this state and he is a smart cookie. So good. I love him on television. He’s no games. Just looks and gives her the answer, but he’s done a fantastic job. The first person on my whole … You read about all these people. This is the first guy and he’s a great guy and he’s a friend of mine, Corey Lewandowski. Where is Corey? Great guy. Tremendous guy. Tremendous help. Thank you, Corey. Are you having a good time, Corey? Who’s going to win this year, Corey? You bet. A little bit slow with that head, Corey.

With the help of everyone here today, we’ve accomplished more in the first three years. We’ve done so much. We’ve done so much. You can go over at taxes and you can go over what we’ve done with the military. We passed the biggest tax cuts ever, ever the history of our country. Now, they want to raise taxes. Think of it. All my life, I’ve watched politicians. Don’t forget, I’ve only been doing this for four and a half years. I haven’t been to … I’ve had senators come in. I’ve had congressmen come in. “Sir, I’ve been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years I’ve only lost three races, sir.” I said, “But I’ve only been doing it for four years and I only won one race, but now I have to win two. One race I won, but it was the president. It was for president.” It was for president, but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country. We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country. I ended the job killing Paris climate accord. That was a killer. That was meant to hurt the United States. By the way, in case you had any questions. Today, the United States is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. To give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn’t need it. Nobody here. Uh-oh, do you need it? Uh-oh. Don’t raise that … Oh she is? Is she okay? I’ll get it for her. Is she okay? We got to get her on the list. Tell me. Oh, from before. Well, that’s a long time before I was president. Does she want to get on the list? Because I’ve seen you at rallies before. I want to get … Will you please, I want to get his wife on the list. It’s called right to try. Right to try. Good work.

He’s been a friend of mine. Come on. He’s been here for a long time. He’s been a good guy for a long time. We got to … Is your wife, how she doing?

She couldn’t get it before me. Well, we had that with Mueller. You saw that with the Mueller’s last night. You saw that, right? Was that Assad with their incredible daughter, what happened? He said if Trump was president that wouldn’t have happened and they’re right, that would not have happened. We took out al-Baghdadi. I wish I were president, you would had a different solution. Thank you. Thank you.

Go ahead. How about you? Yeah. We’ll talk to you later. Right to try. You have no idea. So many people, they used to travel all over the world to get a cure. Now, we can sign a quick simple document. It sounds easy, it wasn’t, but it was easy for me. I understood it. Now, you signed a document. We give you the greatest medicines even if they haven’t been approved. If somebody’s terminally ill, like in the case of your wife, if somebody’s terminally ill, at least you have hope, but it’s beyond that because people have gone home. You have to see some of the results have been incredible. You saw one of the people the other day, right? That wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well. She’s a special person. She really is a special person. Thank you. We’ll talk to you. Thank you very much.

To bring opportunities to our inner cities, I signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. True. Before the China virus came in, before that China virus came in, we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country. We had almost 160 million Americans working. We had never had numbers like that. The Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln. Remember that. We-

We stand for so much, including Martin Luther King’s dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. You know that. The radical left’s effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart. There’s so much racial hatred, and it’s put there by CNN, by MSDNC… They stoke the flames and they know it. The good news is the ratings aren’t great. So that’s okay. They don’t have great ratings. But they stoke the flames. Uh-oh, CNN just turned off their camera again. They always turn off their camera. Why do I keep doing that? Every time I do it, they turn off their camera. They did it last time. I mention CNN, they’re screaming, turn the camera off.

Our movement is about a brighter future for all Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community. I’ve spent the last four years delivering for the African American community like nobody, with the exception possibly of Abraham Lincoln, has delivered before. It’s true. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from the last administration’s horrible, stupid, insane Trans Pacific Partnership. Would’ve destroyed the US auto industry and many other industries. New Hampshire lost one in four, and I think much more than that, manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO. It was more than one in four. That statistic is wrong. Please have it changed. The statistic is wrong, far more than one in four.

Earlier this year, I kept my promise and replaced the NAFTA nightmare with a brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. They said that couldn’t be done. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging and plundering of American jobs. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in America.

USA! USA!

After years of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation and our jobs, and we’re taking care of our people.

Last night, I got great reviews of the speech and all, but some of the fakers back there, they said, “Well, it was a little long. He shouldn’t have used the White House.” Oh really? Tell me. But they said it was a little… Then one person, I think it was Chris Wallace. Nice guy. He’s actually a nice guy. He said that, “He didn’t have the same energy in the speech that he usually has.” Well, it’s a different kind of a speech. Tonight, I’m in New Hampshire and we can wing it.

See, actually, actually Chris, who has always wanted to be his father, but it never worked out because of a lack of talent. Actually though, actually Chris has it wrong. If I did last night’s speech here, by now you would have all been walking out. And if I did tonight’s speech there, I would have been criticized by being slightly radical. But we’re having a good time doing it this way, right? Because we are finally putting America first.

Under my administration, America’s borders are more secure than ever before. We ended the catch and release, stopped asylum fraud. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We’ve already built 300 miles of border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be completed. And our numbers on the border are the best they’ve ever been. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall. Just in case you didn’t know that. They don’t know that. They’re paying for the wall.

You haven’t noticed on the wall. Everything was wall, wall. They didn’t think I was going to get it done. Because look, you have one major party controlling Congress and they don’t want to give me a wall. So they’re going crazy. “Wall. The wall’s not getting done.” Then I get it done. Get it from the military, get it from everything. I’m a developer. I know how to get money. It’s one of those. Developers understand. And now that the wall is almost complete, it’ll be soon complete. And it’s the wall that border security wanted so badly. This is the one. But now that it’s built, you never hear about the wall. They don’t talk about it anymore. They don’t talk about it anymore. It’s incredible. But the wall will soon be complete. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. The space force.

And Al, in honor of you, we have passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, Al. That guy’s been bugging me for years. Al has been bugging me. What’s in that hat, Al? Let me see. Let me… It’s something. Al, he’s been bugging me for years. Did you ever think we’d get VA Choice, VA Accountability? Did you ever really believe it? Thank you, Al.

I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a disaster. $150 billion we paid Iran for a basically short term deal. And we gave them… What’s more impressive, we also gave them $1.8 billion in cash. Cash. Many plane loads. You know what that took? Many, many plane loads, $1.8 billion. I said bad. That’s when I realized how powerful a president is in the United States. When a president has the right, which by the way, I don’t believe he did have that right, okay? When a president has the right to go into the banks and take out $1.8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts, that’s power. That’s power. I don’t believe he had the right to do it.

I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the US embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East in 25 years. You saw that just last week. UAE, highly respected. Mohamed, highly respected. UAE and Israel. And now they’re all going to be coming in. Now they’re all saying, “How come you didn’t tell us about this?” You’ll have peace in the Middle East. And yet we’re moving our trips out. It’s pretty amazing, actually. We’ll get no credit for it, but that’s all right. Remember that Kaitlan. Cover that properly, Kaitlan. We like Kaitlan. Together, we’ve spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of Biden disasters. Joe Biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. He supported NAFTA. China’s entry. He’s done so many things. This man, if you look at what he’s done, we went into a deal, the Korea, you know about the Korea deal? Hillary Clinton’s deal, along with Biden. They promised 250,000 jobs, right? 250,000 jobs. And they were right. Except all those jobs went to South Korea. They didn’t come to us.

He wants mass amnesty. He wants illegal aliens to be taken care of, healthcare and every other way. And he wants to raise your taxes, [ 00:09:52]. Look, your taxes are going to go through the roof. He’s going to destroy your health care. He’s going to have socialized medicine. Remember what Obama said 28 times? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. Turned out to be a lie. Now you’re going to lose your doctor again. And we’re going to lose 185 million people who have private health insurance. Who has private health insurance here? And you love it, right? You love it. It’s luxury. It’s good. It’s beautiful. And you have the greatest, you’re going to lose it. Hate to tell you. Under his plan, you’re going to lose your private healthcare. So here’s a guy, I go into Texas two weeks ago. We had, by the way, on the highway and the roadways, thousands and thousands of people like lined up on the runway in New Hampshire, by the way. What happened to those people? But we had thousands and thousands of people. So I’m in Texas. I’m also, last week in Florida, we got total endorsement from all of the sheriffs. All over Florida. Ohio, many places. But think of Texas. He’s against oil and gas. He’s against guns. And he’s against religion. So you’re in Texas, you’re in Texas, where I’m winning by a lot. They say Texas is very close. I don’t think so. They said that last time too. Remember they said it last time? For them to call it early, you have to be really. So I heard, for a year, Texas is going to be very close. It’s going to be, everybody believed that except for the people that lived in Texas. So at 8:00, the polls close. And they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” Simultaneously with the closing.

I’m now running in Texas against a man who’s against oil, guns, and God. How do you win Texas? I said this, you could bring George Washington back as your Presidential candidate. You could bring Abraham Lincoln. Let’s put him as the Vice Presidential candidate. Run in Texas and other states, you couldn’t win. You couldn’t win. Now, they’re not going to win. We’re going to win this. And you’re against the oil stuff too. Because his whole thing on oil, no fracking, no this, no that. New England has the highest energy costs in the United States. And you know why? Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come.

And do you know where you buy your energy from? Russia. Did you know that? You have ships, much of it from Russia, because Governor Cuomo, New York won’t allow a pipeline and they’re desperate to have something happen in upper New York State. And those are great people, but they’ve been treated very badly. But they won’t allow a pipeline. By not allowing a pipeline, we’re trying to do it through essentially eminent domain. By not allowing a pipeline to go through upper New York State and create a lot of jobs for them, you have the highest energy prices in the United States by far. Thank you New York. Thank you. Thank you Governor Cuomo. Biden voted for the Iraq war. I was against the Iraq war. He opposed a mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. You remember that one?

He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and for the world. That’s not a positive development. Before they went into the WTO, China was flat lined. For years and years and decades, flat lined. And then they got into the WTO and a lot of bad things happened. First China’s stole our jobs, plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus. And now China is trying to just hug and kiss Joe Biden. They want him so badly. Look, if you like China, you should vote for Biden, that I can tell you.

How about his son? You think the son, maybe there’s a conflict? How about his son? Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? Does anybody know? Where’s Hunter? He’s in another country right now, probably, ripping off another country. No, as soon as Biden became vice president, bad things happened with respect to a Hunter. If that happened with respect to my family, I wouldn’t be standing. I guarantee you that. I guarantee you that. What a disgrace. What a disgrace. Ukraine. And it’s not just Ukraine and it’s not just China. But he goes into China, takes out $1.5 billion to manage, and he knows nothing, and he wasn’t even employed. He got thrown out of the armed services. So give me a break. It’s a disgrace, what’s happening.

There’s a double… There’s a thing happening with the media like nobody’s ever seen before. These people right here. Because if that happened to a Republican, in particular. If any of that stuff happened to me, it would be brutal. But it happened to him. They don’t want to talk about it.

And how about the questions asked by Anderson Cooper yesterday? Anderson Cooper. He’s interviewed me a lot over the years and I always got along with him, but they were tough interviews. Did you hear the questions? And Biden kept looking down. I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. Right? I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. And that’s happened before. And how about David Muir of ABC? He’s a nice guy, right? How soft were those questions? How soft were those? They don’t ask me questions like that. They got fire pouring out of their eyes. No. “Mr. Vice President, what do you think of this? How was your breakfast, sir? Did you enjoy it?” When I banned travel from China Biden, called it hysterical and xenophobic. He even used, somewhere along the line, the word racist. He always figures, they always want to get that word in there.

If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. But instead my decision, saved thousands and thousands of lives. And then we banned Europe very early because I saw what was going on, really in Italy and Spain and France. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Mike Pence did a great job. We produced more than 100,000 ventilators within weeks. And not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. You heard all about, and now we’re producing ventilators. Hard to produce. Expensive, complex. We’re producing them now for the rest of the world. 188 countries were affected by this. We pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate. And you look at this, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. 85% since April.

Under Operation Warp Speed, three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials. If you go back three years, that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss. It would have taken years. We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus. It’s already getting defeated.

And by the way, another big Democrat hoax. Another big hoax. I want football back. I’m the one that’s been saying. Is that a correct statement? I want football back. These are young, strong guys. They’re not going to be affected by the virus. If you look at it, it’s generally older people. Older people that have heart conditions, that have diabetes, that have problems. These are big strong guys. They’ll be just fine. But I want football back. I’ve been calling for football to be back, including Big 10. Big 10, get with it. Open up your season, Big 10.

And the Dems don’t want it back for political reasons. But now their new line… This is like Russia, Russia, Russia. All this crap they come up with. Now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down. They want to keep it shut down. And they’re saying that President Trump shut it down. I’m the one that wants it open. So they’re reversing it. They’re playing a big con game. It’s just a con game. And that’s what we’re dealing with. And we have to defeat them on November 3rd. I want football back and Big 10 open. And now the other day, Joe Biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown. He’d be willing to do another blanket. And we had to do it. We blanket, we shut down. We saved millions of lives. Instead of the number we have today, 175,000, we could have had 2 million today instead. It would have been unacceptable, unsustainable. Unsustainable. We did everything right. We did it right. We closed it down. We stopped China. We stopped Europe. Now we’re opening it up and we’re opening it up to record numbers, despite the fact that the Democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states, shut down as long as possible.

But now Biden wants to do another blanket shutdown, possibly, that would decimate the economy and cause suicides, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, heart attacks, joblessness. You’d have jobs, all of the problems that it causes. Because it’s not just a one sided equation. A shut down causes big problems also. And at this point, when the economy is roaring back. We had record job numbers this last quarter, over 9 million jobs. We’re going to throw that all out? We have a market… You know, your stock market. Who has 401k’s here? Your 401k’s and your stocks, when you have stocks, would be obliterated. And right now, we have just, on two of your markets, as you know, S&P and NASDAQ, you’re at new records. And you’re about to hit another new record.

Think of it. Who would have thought the stock market? And hopefully we’re at the end of this horrible China virus. Came from China. They should have stopped it and they did. But who would have thought, just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now? Record levels.

And everything else is going to follow. Before the virus, we created an economic miracle and now we’re doing it again. We did the Paycheck Protection Program where we saved more than 200,000 jobs in New Hampshire alone. 200,000, right?

Over the past three months, we’ve gained so many different, if you look at retail numbers. Take a look at our retail numbers. They’re literally at records. Look at some of the numbers be announced by companies. They’re at records. Can you imagine giving that all up and starting again? It’s not acceptable. If I’m reelected, we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months, and we’ll do that easily. The Biden agenda, with big tax increases and big regulation increases, would immediately kill everything. You will go into a depression. And I’m very good at predicting this. You will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929, and who knows, maybe worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission.

… be worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes. They want to raise your taxes by $4 trillion. And that’s going to be almost everybody. They’re saying for the rich. No, not for the rich. They’re going to be raising everybody’s taxes almost. Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in American history and of our foreign adversaries, we’re devising a plan to destroy the United States from within. All they have to look is at the Biden Harris. How about her? Is she a beauty? What a beauty that is.

They pick a woman who starts off… She starts off sort of strong. She’s one of the favorites. Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two. Then she goes, “I’m going to leave because I’ve decided that I want to leave. I want to leave.” She left because she wouldn’t have gotten any votes. She was terrible. This would be your president possibly. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I want to see the first woman president also, but I don’t want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she’s not competent. She’s not competent. They’re all saying we want Ivanka. I don’t blame them. They want to eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a pandemic, suspend all deportations, restore catch and release, and expand horrible, dangerous, disgusting sanctuary cities. They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers. That’s what we need is more lawyers. Let’s get some more lawyers into the act. They want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations, very dangerous, and increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, you know crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time. You know why? Because of trade. Because I agree with Bernie Sanders, but my trade policies are much tougher than his and I’m able to do it. All you have to do is how is China doing last year with my trade policy? Not too well. And we had the best year we’ve ever had.

We’re going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade. They really like it because I’ve been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by China and many other countries, including, I hate to say it, our allies. Our allies have been ripping us big. And you heard me say last night, NATO, I got $130 billion from them first time going up to $400 billion a year from NATO countries, by saying, “You got to do it. You got to do it.” And general Secretary Stoltenberg said it can’t be done. He could not believe it. He’s actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote. Call him sometime.

They want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement. They want to end… We want to increase law enforcement, not cut law enforcement. And by the way, Pat Lynch is a great guy, New York, New York. Really great, New York’s finest, right? Their rights have been taken away from them. Literally they’re not allowed to do their job, but Pay Lynch, he said the first time in history that they know of New York’s finest have endorsed a candidate. The candidate is Donald Trump. First time they’ve done it.

All over the country, the sheriffs of Florida, all of Texas, all over the country, Ohio, law enforcement’s endorsing Trump. I cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements. If they do, please let me know and we’ll have a little discussion. We’ll ask why did that happen? They want to end school choice and ban charter schools. They want to abolish American energy, including all of the things I said before. And add to that coal and add to that shale. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a bright future, the American dream for all Americans. There is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years. So in conclusion, I have to say this. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world that’s happening already. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll do it here. Like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities.

We will kill our terrorist’s enemies as we’ve been doing while keeping America out of the endless foreign Wars. I go to Dover and I greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed. So sadly killed. It’s such a shame. I go to the hospital, I go to Walter Reed Medical Center. It’s incredible. The doctors are so talented. I see what they can do, but soldiers so badly hurt. And they’re really acting as police. They’re acting as police. Now, we’re very low in Afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops. We’re getting out. We’ll be getting out soon. We’re very low in Iraq. We’re very low in Syria, except we kept the oil. We left some behind for the oil. If you don’t mind, we kept the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq like I’ve been saying.

We’ll appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda, which is what we have in many cases right now. The next president will be in my opinion, responsible for two, three, four, and maybe, maybe even five US Supreme Court Justices. You better vote for me, you better vote for me or you’re going to have the greatest depression you’ve ever seen. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment.

We will surprise medical billing require, it’s already done. I signed it. Nobody can believe I did it. Price transparency. You know what that is? Do you know how big that is? Where you’re able to actually negotiate with hospitals, see their prices, compare it. You know who likes it? Good hospitals and good doctors. Other people don’t like it. It’s the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it, but I’ve already put it into effect. The bad news is it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure you elect me so I get credit for it.

Otherwise, could you imagine if sleepy Joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped, but he said, “I wonder what happened?” And I did it all. I’ll be so angry at New Hampshire. I’ll never speak to you again. Now, all these things, what we’re doing with drugs, we instituted a favored nations laws. We instituted favored nations. That’s going to drop your prices 50, 60, 70%. And I’m the only president in 51 years, last year, drug prices went down a little, not much, but they went down the first time in 51 years. Favored nations could drop at 50, 60, or 70%. On top of that, I instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman. So we will protect Medicare and we will protect Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful American flag. Do we love our American flag? Or Mars. Above all, we will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the New Hampshire state motto. Have you ever heard of these words? Live free or die. Live free or die. Vote for those people. And you do, you have a great governor. Vote for your people, vote for your governor. You have a great governor. From Portsmouth to Dixville from Concord to Keene. I know a friend from Keene. Great guy. I had a friend from Keene a long time. Keene, New Hampshire. And Merrimack to Manchester, we will fight for every job, every family and every neighborhood. We will fight for every vote. We have to win. We have no choice. Can I be honest with you? We’re working hard. We’re all working. I don’t have to do this. I could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe. That was mine. But that’s Air Force one. I get off that beautiful plane. I could come up and say, “Ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, you have no choice. You have to vote for me because if you don’t, you’ll be put in radical lefties. You’ll have a depression. Your stocks will be worthless. Your 401ks will be gone. There’ll be crime all over your streets. So I’m not going to work at all. I’m leaving now, but you have to vote for me because you have no choice.” Right? I could say it. Right? Right?

We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads. Won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater. We will be greater than ever before. Incredible citizens like you, the people of New Hampshire, helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country. We’re not going to let it.

We’re returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one nation under God. And we don’t take the beautiful word God out of our Pledge of Allegiance, do we? They did it twice. They it twice. Then they say, “Well, we didn’t mean that.” Oh, I see. I was listening once they said, “That’s right.” You don’t know what it is, what happened? What happened? They did it on purpose. They did it twice. That’s where they’re coming from. You can be fools and you can be fooled, but that’s where they’re coming from. So don’t be surprised, but they’re not going to get there. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs.

America will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of New Hampshire that have meant so much to me, and I brought down opioid and I brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it. 19. I talk about New Hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country, of any state in this incredible country. You had one of the worst problems of any of the states. And I talk about you a lot. It was incredible. And you still have. But we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked.

If it weren’t for the China plague, the number would be 25 or 30%. That really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don’t want to be shut down any longer. Joe, don’t you understand that? They don’t want to be shut down. So I worked very hard on that for this state and for other states, but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem. That wall is stopping them and it’s stopping them like never before. It’s stopping them like never before.

I want to thank New Hampshire for all you’ve done for me. I want to thank New Hampshire. You were my first victory, as I said, but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we’ve ever had. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you.",28/8/20
"
So thank you Pennsylvania, very much. I’m thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer. What a great guy he was. What a great guy. Thank you very much. 61 days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House. Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China. You know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob. He’s trying to change now. We say that’s not working because we’re going up and he’s dropping like a rock in water.

And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work and we’ve done a great job on it. We don’t get the credit. We don’t get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and I’ll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. That’s what we’re doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest. These are bad people.

Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, secured American energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re going to do it again. Have to do it again. Have to do it again. Got to do it again.

And it’s happening. You see what’s happening. Job numbers, retail sale numbers, they’re all at records. It’s happening. It’s happening very fast. It’s actually happening in a super V, not a V. It’s a super V and you’ll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out, and just watch your set or watch your newspaper. Read your newspaper. You’re seeing numbers that, congressmen, we haven’t seen those numbers ever before, actually. We’ve never seen them. And by the way, we have record stock markets. We have record everything. You’re going to have an incredible economic year next year. Your stocks are going up. Your 401k)s are through the roof.

I had a little pause today. People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way. But the stock market’s at record levels. Think of it. In the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic, we’re rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great. The job that they’ve done, the doctors, everybody else, we’re years ahead of schedule. Anybody else’s President, you wouldn’t be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now. I’ll tell you right now. That I can tell you.

Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop hating extremists. And they are cop hating. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, I don’t know if you saw this, if there’s any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we’re trying to get them in. And I’d love to get them in. I mean, it’s an airport. Let them go to the runways. Okay? Let them in. I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. We’re doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can’t do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I don’t have to travel. I get off the plane. I make a speech. I get the hell out of here.

No, these are great. Do you remember the last days before the campaign? I’d do a lot of them a day. Get off that plane. It was a little different plane. It was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time. And that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today. With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have.
But we had record enthusiasm in 2016. By the way, was that greatest evening ever? November. And now it’s going to be November 3rd, and we’ll keep it going and we’ll get it all like a tree. You move that tree. It takes a little while to plant, your tax cuts. They’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to take away your guns. Really, if you look. And you know, they’ll criticize me for saying this, the fake news media, which is back there, with their fake polls. The same as last year. We could just put it all on tape. The fake polls, the fake everything. You know, they’re called suppression polls. They’re meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed? You don’t look depressed. We have the real numbers. We’re leading everywhere. We are leading everywhere. I’ll tell you.

I think we’re way ahead of what we were four years ago, and there’s far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. It’s stronger. And we’ve done the greatest job. Again, if we didn’t get hit by the plague from China, between us, I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn’t have needed a rally. That’s a little bit unfair, but that’s okay. That’s what China’s done to our nation. They’ve screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and I’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in 25 cents from China. And I gave $28 billion, right, $28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China. And our farmers are very unhappy.

I don’t think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town. I know we have a lot of boilermakers over there. We got a lot of boilermakers, I’ll be talking about them. Look at those guys. Nobody going to mess with them. I’ll tell you. We’re going to be talking about them in a minute.

But for the entire summer, Biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians, and just recently marched through the streets chanting, “Death to America.” This is what we have. Death to America.

And by the way, we could end it like immediately. You saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. It took a while for the governor. You know, they have to ask us in. It’s like, otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it’s totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There was nobody there. He was a little late. I was going to say, “Hey, listen, we ended that problem.” But we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland. Anarchists. They’re agitators. They’re looters. I’ll tell you we could end it in Portland in a half an hour.

We did it in Seattle. We told them we’re coming in. You either end it or were coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We were all set. I was actually disappointed, to be honest. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20% of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, “No, it’s going to be a summer of love.” These people are crazy. So we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we’re doing is we’re holding back funds for cities that don’t know what they’re doing, where they allow crime to run rampant.

And we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don’t get things like that today. They think that you should just have no cash bail. They do the no cash bail. You kill somebody. There’s no bail. Don’t worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordinance. I gave a new executive order. It says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down. No statutes.

And we’re actually prosecuting people for having done it. We made it retroactive to the beginning. Terrible. Terrible. And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing. It’s real easy. But the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda, it’s what they want. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They want to end that cash bail. They want to hire far left prosecutors and judges, and let the criminals run wild. The radical left District Attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name is, has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting, and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance. Oh, it’s worse. It’s worse.

You have somebody in Philadelphia who’s worse, right? Worse. In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that’s what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You notice now, “No, no. I never said about fracking. I never said.” If you don’t do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don’t think you should have it. Okay? No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where he, no fracking, no this, no that, I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns. No second amendment.

Biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide. That’s what he’s done. That’s called the manifesto. He agreed to all this stuff. The craziest thing, you’re supposed to bring it to the right. He actually brought it further left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, crazy Bernie. Do you know crazy Bernie? I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why? Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade. The trade. Because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it. Especially Biden never got it. He never got it. Still doesn’t get it. Now he really gets nothing. I tell you. He didn’t get it in prime time. Now he really doesn’t get it.

But it’s okay for them to make every city look just like Portland which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up. We just go right through it. 5,000, 10,000, right through it. These guys are tough. They’re smart. And they love our country. They love our country. We’ll clean it up in one half hour. It’ll be over.

Did you see this radical left? Mayor Wheeler, his name is. The radical left mayor. They chased him, Mike. They chased him out of his home last night. And all he does is be nice to them because they don’t understand nice. They only understand one thing: strength. They don’t understand. Nice. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorist. And my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them.

And I will always defend law abiding citizens. That’s why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they’re all voting for me.

This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I’m delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like. Sort of grew up with these people. I don’t know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. What I’m endorsing, I’m getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. At last year, you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation, right? Of your whole operation. You’ve never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. It’s been the Commonwealth’s greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state? You have two places. But you always have to say, well, wait a minute. Is this one a Commonwealth? Two places. You know what the other place is? Name it. Huh? That’s right. How did you know that, Congressmen? Huh?

But this Commonwealth, it’s a great Commonwealth. It’s a great place. And the boilermakers, local union, it’s Local 154 of the boilermakers. They chartered in Pittsburgh 125 years ago. None of you were around to see it, and it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I want to thank John Hughes and the boilermakers here today. It’s a great honor to have you. Where’s John? Where the hell is John? Stand up, John. John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it.

Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he’s got the worst location. I say, “Where’s John?” I’m looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He’s great. You’ve got my vote, John. Hey, boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do. You’re the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That’s a great endorsement. That’s a great endorsement.

Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations. And I’ve spent the last four years bringing them back home and we’re bringing them back home. Bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administration’s eight year pure war on Pennsylvania oil, and coal, and fracking. If you look at the natural gas, what they’ve done to this state, what they were doing to this state. It was sort of easy. I just opened it up and I said, “Do it.” And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting. But again, you had the greatest year you’ve ever had last year prior to the virus. You’re going to be set. Now with what we’re doing, I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced, interestingly, just prior to the election, so I’m putting myself on the line, but I know what’s going to happen. The numbers are going to be great. And next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country.

So Joe Hiden, we have a new one, Joe Hiden. We call him Joe Hiden. I have all. What do you like better? What do you like better? We got a number. Let’s do a little poll. Can we do a poll? I saved myself so much money. You know, I saved myself so much money. We do these polls with thousands, and those people are coming in from the back, are they not? Yes? They’re coming in. I’m telling you wouldn’t have believed it. I’m landing. I wasn’t waving at you. I was waving at them. There’s more. But I do these polls. Right? And it’s like a perfect poll. Do you ever see the companies? You give them a million bucks and they do a poll, like 78 people were polled. Now you’ve got thousands of people.

So tell me. What’s your feeling, first of all in the name You like MAGA, Make America Great Again? Yes? Oh, you are the one. You are a man. I made you famous today. You said the nicest things about me. Thank you. Did you see him on television today? I think you’re great. I think you’re great. Thank you. No, he called me a great Christian and a great Christian leader. Thank you. But he did say I wasn’t perfect, but that’s okay. I said thank you, anyway. Right? No, that was really great. That was really great. Biden-

No that was really great. That was really great. But if you look at it, the things they’ve done, we’re going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because I love the people saying do this or do that. But one of the things I got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it’s so bad. It’s a rip off of our country. The so-called Paris Climate Accord. It’s a disaster, a death sentence. It’s a death sentence for your energy jobs. I took it out. I withdrew from that calamity. Biden pledged to reinstate it. It’s going to cost you billions and billions of dollars. You know what it really is? It’s a way of really taking advantage of the United States. This is what it is. Last year I visited the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County. Anybody ever hear of Beaver County?

The largest investment in your state’s history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies. Biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers. It’s probably 940,000 they say. Think of that. Also, prices and everything else. Now Biden today came out and said, “No, no, fracking’s okay, it’s okay? Did you see that? Fracking’s okay. Because he was getting killed. And now we came out in favor of law enforcement. Look at all these handsome cops here. And a beautiful cop.

No, but how can anybody believe it? He’s totally against, at his speech and at the DNC, where we got much higher numbers than they did, but they put out that they did, they’ll say anything. We got much higher by millions and millions of people. We had a great… Did we have a great convention? Right? We had a… Here’s my guy. Good job you did. But we had a great convention and it’s been a really terrific. I made a speech at Mount Rushmore and since that speech, our numbers have been up, up, up like a rocket, like a beautiful rocket, the Mount Rushmore speech. I said we’re getting hit by this pandemic very unfairly in the sense that we’ve done such a good job with the ventilators, all of the things, you’ve heard it a thousand times, and we have to get back. And I made a speech in really a great place, South Dakota, but it was Mount Rushmore. They want to blow it up. They want to take off my [ 00:28:35]. If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great majestic heroes of our country, right? Heroes of our country. And they want to blow Mount Rushmore. But how about this one? The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan. Did you see it? Now, they’re the DC Democrats. They want to change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down.

Thomas Jefferson, pretty good Thomas Jefferson, right? You could forget about ever hearing that name again. Abraham Lincoln, you could forget about it. They want to take down all statues, all monuments in Washington. We have some of your greatest people right here. Let me not even talk to the congressmen. The heck with the Congressman, the boiler makers. How do you like? How do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, all of them? I don’t think the boiler makers. You’ll do a ring around Washington right? Along with Christopher Columbus. He’s in big trouble I’ll tell you. Except there was one, there was a group of great Italians in New York, they tried to take down.

They tried to take down Christopher Columbus statue in New York. You saw what happened, right? These Italians formed a little circle. They said, “Come on.” The agitators decided to leave. “Let’s get out of here darling.” They protected Christopher Columbus. The Italians, now the Italians aren’t big on taking down Christopher Columbus. You take down those statues you can forget about the Italian vote. Do we agree? But they protected it. When asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal, and fracking, and natural gas, and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work, and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country, Biden said, “No, we would absolutely not allow anything like that. We would make sure it’s totally eliminated.” That’s what he said. He said, “We would make sure it’s totally eliminated or eliminated.” Now he’s coming and saying, “This isn’t working too well. This isn’t working.”

And I made a speech a week ago in Texas. We had crowds that were unbelievable, on the highways, you can’t get in, but the highways, it’s like incredible. You could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money, go to eBay. Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell. But you go down the highways and you see it, and I was thinking of Texas, I’m making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil, they like God, and you know what else they like, they like their Second Amendment, right? So think about it. So whether it’s Pennsylvania, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or any place, you take a look at this, right? And no oil, no guns, no God. I don’t think George Washington running with Abraham Lincoln as his VP, he’ll pick Abraham Lincoln as VP is going to win in Texas, or in Pennsylvania, or any place else with those three things eliminated.

That’s what they want to do. They want to take away your Second Amendment. If I weren’t president, you would either have an obliterated Second Amendment or it would be gone entirely. I am standing between them and your Second Amendment. And that’s it. That’s it. They know.

We put Baido in charge of guns. Baido is in charge, he wants to get rid of everything. Baido, that’s a beauty. Remember he said, “I was born for this.” Anybody that says they’re born for this. Remember Baido? He was on the cover of a magazine, I won’t mention the magazine, they’re back there. It’s a total phony magazine. But he was on the cover of the magazine. And he said, “I was born to run for president.” He was born for it. I was born. Anybody that gets that character. That was when he was doing well. Since then he’s cratered. Ever since he made that statement, he’s looked very bad. But take a look at what he says about guns, and he got put in charge of guns. So I guess Biden pretty soon he’s going to be coming out saying, “No, no. I never said that.”

Check out all of the statements he’s made on everything and now he’s going the opposite way, but he’s agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he’ll do that. And then he figures later on, he’ll go. But everything he said is right, because he has no control over what’s happening. The radical left has captured the party. They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, it’s been a while, against a young, good looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts. Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts? You know why? Because he wasn’t a radical left. He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left. No, but think of it. This is what’s happened. And this is really what’s happened. If you’re not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind. To make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save.

It’s just the craziest thing. Also, I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand. When we do things and they don’t, and we clean, and it’s very expensive to do that and they don’t, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, it’s fuming up and we’re doing our job and beautiful. No, they have to do it also. Otherwise, it just doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. They want to ban straws. Has anybody ever tried those paper straws? They are not working too good. Right? They want to ban straws, I said, well, I’ve had a couple of meals at McDonald’s, et cetera over the years, right? Wendy’s, a friend of mine owns Wendy’s, I’ll give it a plug, right? Burger King. So they want to ban straws. I said, “Oh really? What about the carton? What about the plate? What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic?” Oh, they’re okay, but the straws we got ban. Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, it’s made out of paper, right? It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance. By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated. Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw? Because it’s that bad. You whip it out, boom, boom. You never had to do that. When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right? It’s the Green New Deal, right? This Green New Deal. This was made up by people that don’t get it. Either that or people that just don’t like our country very much. But Biden replied yes, he’ll get rid of those jobs. And he famously told a voter, “I want you to look in my eyes,” when he’s not wearing the mask because I’ve never seen a man that liked their mask. Look, I’m all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you’re close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things. We have Labor Day Weekend coming up. But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down. Because you know what? It gives him a feeling of security.

If I were a psychiatrist, right? I’d say, “This guy’s got some big issues.” Hanging down. Hanging down. Congressman, give me your mask. I want to have it hanging from my ear. I don’t want to touch your damn mask. Mike I’ll never touch your mask. No, but the new one is, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, “Sir would you like to go over to Walter Reed? It’s incredible.” By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes. The job they do is incredible. “Sir would you like to go over and do a physical? You have some time.” You know why I had time? Some deal, oh, it was China. I decided not to see China because I didn’t like the way they were doing business, okay? Does that make sense?

So the doctor, White House doctor, highly respected, Sean, Sean Conley, “Sir would you like to go over and do your physical, or do a piece of it, or finish it?” or whatever it was, but do a physic. I said, “I don’t know. I’m not in love with the idea.” “Well, if you do it, you don’t have to do…” “Okay. Let’s go. Come on.” So we went, we went, and we’re driving. Now you have to understand, they’re like a hundred cars. You see what happens here. It’s like the plane times 50. So the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital, I get out. I was there probably for an hour and a half, two hours. And then yesterday I read that I had strokes. CNN, fake news CNN right there. No, it’s true. Mini strokes they called them.

I don’t know what a mini stroke is, but it’s not good. And there could be a day and I’ll admit, I said “Hey, it happens all of us.” Right? Except these young ones. It’s never going to happen to them. And I’d look at it at that, but you know what happens?

But nothing happened. So I went in, I did that part of the physical. The end result was he’s very healthy. They were very unhappy when they heard that result. What you don’t remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago. They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Biden’s physical level. They view me as being somebody that’s, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington. Let’s go here, let’s go there, let’s go everywhere. Meetings all the time. I think I’ve answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history. And mean questions. I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasn’t answered questions in what, two months or something. And yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like I’ve never seen. One young woman who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, “Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi. I just like to ask you, I’m sorry to bother you with this question.” It’s the most incredible.

So the doctor wrote a letter saying, “No, this rumor is wrong.” And I don’t like, rumors like that. And by the way, if it were a fact, it’s fine, it should. I think it’s an important thing. But if it’s not true, my wife was like, she came to me, she said, “I think I would have known that.” I said, “Yeah, I think they would have known it too, because they drove back with me.” The press follows me, they have a special deal, and then they followed me and then we go in, we go out. But if you remember, last time, I go in, I spend a little time, a physical like we all have. Hopefully you have them. Good thing to have I guess, as long as they give you a good answer. If they give you a bad answer don’t bother, possibly too late. But I go in, I come out a couple of hours later I guess, whatever it is, it’s a short time later, I get into the car, the press sees me get into the car.

On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the First Lady who’s very popular. Do we like our First Lady? Very popular, great person, great woman. She said, “Darling, are you okay?” I go, “Why do you ask?” She said, “They’re reporting that you had a heart attack.” Now you have to understand I’m driving in a car, which is about what? Six cars in front of the press, because they have a big car. They’re a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable. But they’re right behind me. So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack. That was the same visit, and that didn’t work. No it’s unbelievable.

CNN reported I had a heart attack so my wife was concerned. I said, “No, not that I know of. And if I did, I think I’d be back there. No. I’ll be home in 15 minutes, darling. Thank you for caring.” It’s always nice. It’s always nice. She sounded relieved. That’s good. When your wife sounds relieved. But she said, ” I wonder how that happened. Why did they do that?” Because they’re fake news. So I go in and that rumor lasted for a little while, like a day or two. It lasted for a little while, no matter what I did. I’m in the same motorcade, I go in, and I go out. They know I’m in the motorcade, I actually have to report it, but I’m in the motorcade, and they said I had a… One of them said it was a massive heart attack. Think of it. Again, it could happen someday, okay? And when it does, I hope things work out. But they knew I’m in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news.

Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing. From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it because this was a quick thing. The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble. He’s a great doctor. I said, “No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time.” So now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times who’s a third grade reporter writes a book and he said, “The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go,” I guess, under anesthesia. Do they still call it…? In the old days they called it anesthesia. It’s essentially the same thing. I don’t want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player. Remember that? You go home, you turn on your record player. But the anesthesia. And I said, “How could that be?” So remember, this is the same visit, same visit.

They said heart attack a long time. All of a sudden out of this book. And he said, “Suffered mini strokes.” Now they get a letter from the White House doctor that said it’s totally false, totally false. But they still go with it, they go with it. And they know I’m in the group with them coming back. And I don’t know much about a mini stroke, but I assume Mr. Congressman, if you have a mini stroke, you’re not heading back to the White House, right? At least you’ll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital, right? So anyway, these are really dangerous people. They are so bad for our country. If we had honest press, it would be so great for the USA. It would be so great. They’re just a bunch of phony people. Not all of them. You have some very good ones, like about 10%. No, you have some very good ones, you have some great journalists, they know it’s phony stuff. They’re doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the White House and I just don’t think the public is going to fall for it.

I don’t think the public is going to fall for it. In his best days, 25, 30 years ago, he was weak. He was weak. As a Senator, he was weak. He was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it’s not exactly primetime, I can tell you that. I just want to announce tonight because we’re joined with some very, very special warriors and Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you very much. Great job you’re doing. Dan, Congressman. He’s a Congressman who have really been warriors for me. You really have been. Thank you very much Dan. Fred Keller, Fred, thank you. Great job, Fred. The great John Joyce. Great, thank you, John. Guy Reschenthaler. Do you know him? Guy Reschenthaler. what are you doing over there? What happened? You don’t get along with these guys? Oh, okay. That’s good. Now I understand. That’s good. Glenn Thompson. Great job, great job Glenn, really great. And a real good friend of mine, right from the beginning, right, Mike? We were in Pennsylvania and a friend of ours, a Congressman, longterm, right? From Kentucky. No, from actually Tennessee came up to us, I was getting ready to make a speech, and Tennessee is very early voting. Remember what he said? This was four years ago. He said, “I don’t know what’s happening in Pennsylvania. I don’t know what’s happening in the rest of the country. But if what’s going on in the rest of the country is like what’s going on in Tennessee?” He said, “They’re coming from the Hills, the roadsides, the rivers.” He said they’re coming, people that never really cared to vote, they’re great Americans, but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing.

He said, “They’re miles long. They’ve got Trump here, Trump hats, Trump pins,” right? Tennessee. Duncan, Congressman Duncan, right? Remember that Mike? That was the first time. I mean, they said that they’d never seen anything like it. Tennessee has been incredible by the way. So Mike and I listened and we said, “I wonder what that’s all about.” But it is true. People that weren’t really political people, they’re coming in, and the deal here, like the Miss Universe, good old Miss Universe, right? Like this, they came with hats, they came with pins, they’re loaded with pins. One person had hundreds of pins. They never would’ve had a pin in their life, but they love the job that we’ve done and we’re going to do it even better in the next four years.

Another great friend of mine who’s a tough cookie and a great Congressman. But unfortunately he’s a former because he’s just, I don’t know., He’s just a special guy and really has a big, beautiful heart, Lou Barletta, Lou. You look good Lou. Why don’t you run again Lou? And a man who is tough. There’s this guy. You ever hear of a guy named Conor Lamb? He’s like a lamb. So we heard, because he’s in sort of a Trumpy area, right? And we heard that he’s going to be for Trump, but he’s going to be fighting for Trump. I saw some of his commercials, I thought he was a Republican, right? Except when he got to Washington, he voted with Pelosi a hundred percent of the time. Craziness. He voted with craziness. And so we thought, this Conor lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing. Zero. Zero. And that’s very personal. When they do that, that’s personal. And I have to say congressmen, 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the Senate other than Romney. You can have Romney I think.

Romney couldn’t be elected dog catcher in Utah, right. Although he gave me a half a vote. It was 52 and a half to a half. That was Romney, what a [ 00:49:41]. Remember he was walking with the Black Lives Matter saying, “Yes, I’m a member of Black Lives Matter.” Everyone said, “That’s nice. Wonderful.” He had a lot of mask on, I’ll tell you that. But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing. But this Conor Lamb was out there fighting it, and he shouldn’t have done that. And we have somebody that blows him away. He’s more of a hero, he’s tougher, he’s stronger, he’s smarter, he’s better looking, not that, that matters. Under the me too generation, I don’t talk about looks anymore. Looks don’t matter. Doesn’t make any difference. I don’t talk about looks. Me too. Me too generation. But I’ll tell you, this man is something special. He’s a real hero, a real tough guy, and he’ll never let you down, Sean Parnell.

Just remember that Conor lamb, and I remember, because he’s like a lamb, he’s like a little lamb. Weak, got a lot of weak people. We like strong people, don’t we? We like strong people. We need strong people right now. We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible. He was the Governor of Texas for what? 12 years I think. Rick right? 12? Tell me. 14? 14 years he was. And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and he’s been an incredible friend. Rick Perry everybody. There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick. What he said about me, I’ll never repeat again. Even my own family didn’t like me when he got finished. And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and there’s nobody that’s said better things about me. But you’re great Rick, and you did a fantastic job. Every place you’ve been, you’ve been great. Thank you very much. Rick Perry. Thank you.

Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas?

Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas? We had a poll today in Georgia. They say, “Georgia’s going to be close.” Well this was a poll that hates Trump and we’re up seven. That was the same thing happened last time, right? You know they use the words in play. “Georgia is in play,” they say, Georgia’s in play. Well we’re up seven and this is a poll that truly hates us, okay? But they did the last time. Didn’t they say last time that Texas was in play? And then it was 8:00, the polls closed and they only announce if you’re way ahead. So they say, “The polls have closed in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.”

I kept hearing it was in play. They said Utah, the home of our worst senator, they said Utah, was in play. That’s Mitt Romney. Mike Lee is doing excellent. I didn’t want to get them confused by the way, but they say Utah same thing, remember that? Four years ago, we had the guy with the shaved head. What was his name, Rick? What a loser that was, you know who I’m talking about. That’s right. McMuffin I think, something like that. He was going to win Utah and I won it by many, many, many points, it was called immediately. So these are people that are just [ 00:53:28] … Hillary even beat this guy. Hillary. Hillary came in second in Utah.

In less than four years we’ve achieved more than anyone thought possible. We passed massive tax cuts for hardworking families and we eliminated more regulations than any administration in the history of our country. I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job-killing catastrophe known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have been a catastrophe, not only for autos by the way, for everything else too. To protect our workers I imposed stiff tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. That kept you guys very busy. [ 00:54:20] all over the place [ 00:54:24]. This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them. So we stopped that.

We’re reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that. This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organizations, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in. They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal. They’re considered a developing nation, you see I’ve been sort of protesting that like, but they’re considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States. Well we have very strongly protested that. They’re not a developing nation, they’re a very powerful developed nation, and you know what? They got to pay what everyone else has to pay. Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well. Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging, plundering and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs. That’s all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by China and others. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America.
After years and years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, it’s called America First. We’re America First, that’s enough, and we’re bringing our soldiers back home. You see what’s going on. After 19 years in Afghanistan, far away places, to bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunity zones, Tim Scott, great senator from South Carolina worked on it with me. Passed criminal justice reform, delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that Obama would never do and before the China virus we achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever recorded by far. And they’re now heading back in that direction quickly. Democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades, they’ve failed the Asian community, the Hispanic community. They failed women. The numbers on women’s unemployment were the best in 61 years. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the American people. He was always for things that you wouldn’t want and now he’s changing, “No, I never said that. I never said that.” I’ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African-American community and for all communities and the best is yet to come.

Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration, we’ve been fighting for that. Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast. Thank you ICE. ICE and Border Patrol. ICE and Border Patrol. They don’t like ICE because ICE is, they’re tough. You got to be tough in that job by the way. Anybody up here like to work in ICE? I don’t think so. Let’s see, you could probably be okay but you’d rather do what you’re doing, right? I agree with you. These are tough guys, they have to be tough. These are bad, bad gang members. I mean you look at MS-13, you look at what’s happened with MS-13, you look at … We get them the hell out. Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don’t even want to take a chance, they can come back in after what they’ve done.

We built 300 miles of border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles every single week. Every week and the wall will be finished very soon and by the way, they keep saying, “But Mexico will be paying for the wall,” and I said respectfully to Mexico but they will be paying for the wall. They understand that, they just don’t want to write it and that’s okay too. Because Mexico’s treated us very well. The president of Mexico, right now they have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border guarding us from people coming in illegally into our country. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years since the Air Force and that’s called the Space Force. [ 01:00:21] pretty good. Going to send my kid to space, you want to go into space, bud? Our great congressman, but think of that. You know we created a new branch of the United States … That alone, if you had that, that alone, but then you add judges, all the other things. We passed VA choice, the VA accountability. So now instead of waiting for a week, two weeks, five weeks, nine weeks to see a doctor, you don’t have a doctor, you go right out, you get a private doctor, we pay the bill and our great veterans get better quickly. And accountability, we keep people accountable for the way they treat our veterans and if they don’t treat them well, we say, “Sorry, you’re fired. Get out.” We couldn’t fire anybody. We had [ 01:01:11], we had thieves, we had some very bad people in the VA and they’re all gone. Thank you, I love you too, thank you. Thank you. Such friendly voices. Quite beautiful. Only in Pennsylvania, right? Thank you.

I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, think of this. Obama paid $150 billion for a short-term deal. He gave $1.8 billion in cash. You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in $100 bills? It’s a lot, it’s like the size of this, right? Now think $1.8 billion. How did you guys allow that to happen? They said we all voted against it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel. You never know nowadays, right? And I opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately.

By the way, as far as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, they’ve been talking about many, many presidents. They all promised it, nobody did it. I did it. We get things done, and we just did something that is incredible. Even the New York Times gave it good reviews, not good reviews, beyond good reviews. Tom Friedman gave it phenomenal reviews, you believe that? That’s we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades, a deal with Israel and the UAE. It’s a deal with Israel and the UAE and that’s going to lead and I’m going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal. You’ll have peace in the Middle East. We want to get the hell out. Let’s get them all back. Let’s get thel all back. Don’t forget, we’re energy independent. There used to be a reason. Now we do have a reason, it’s called Israel, and we have some very good partnerships over there. In all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we’re going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and that’s a very good feeling.

Our military has never been stronger than it is now. It’s new and it’s beautiful and I told you we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and separately, we killed the world’s number one terrorist, number one terrorist for decades and decades, Qasem Soleimani. We killed Soleimani. It’s a big step for the Middle East. We kept America out of wars. Remember they always said, “Oh, this Trump. He’s radical, he’s really, I mean he’s off the … He’s too radical. He’ll get us in wars.” I kept us out of wars, what happened with North Korea? Look, I get along with Kim Jong-un. They say, “That’s terrible he gets along.” No it’s good if I get along. If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think it’s a good thing.

These maniacs, any time … They always talk about Russia, they never talk about China. It’s very interesting. It’s always Russia, I heard it’s starting again, they said somebody spoke to Russia two years ago. Russia, Russia, Russia. This total maniac Shifty Schiff, he’s a total maniac. Do you ever notice, I can’t even listen to him but when I hear Russia I just turn it off. It’s crazy but you know getting along with countries is actually a good thing. Can we explain thing? It’s a good thing, not a bad thing. It’s a very good thing. Remember I was the one that was going to be leading you into war, in the first week, he’ll be in war, he’s a radical kind of a personality. I’m really not, I like to have peace, but if we ever do get into war, we will knock the hell out of them, whoever [ 01:05:41]. These guys only fight to tie, they don’t fight to win, you fight to win.

You look at what’s happening where they’re all coming back home. I even reduced in Germany because Germany, they’re an ally, but you know, they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military. So we removed a lot of soldiers out of Germany. They’re not happy, they said, “This is going to hurt our economy.” Well it’s good for our economy, okay? They thought it was going to hurt the German economy. Well, they don’t treat us right, they don’t pay their bills, they’re delinquent. You know what delinquent is? They’re delinquent. They don’t pay their bills. We protect them, they don’t pay their bills. We got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the European Union which basically they run.

Together we’ve been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them. Joe Biden supported NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade. He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad. This was a deal that was going to produce to South Korea done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs. She said, ” This will be 250,000,” and she was right, for South Korea. It produced 250,000 jobs. For us, we got nothing. We got losses, we got nothing. It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now it’s a good deal. They also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Biden supported cutting Social Security. He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, “That’s a terrible thing. That’s a terrible thing.” Everybody in the Middle East, they couldn’t believe it. They celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add.

He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the entire world. Remember that? Now he’s trying to say, “Well I can be tough on China too.” No he can’t. China owns him. China owns Sleepy Joe. He’s not going to be tough on China and he said all these wonderful things and then all of a sudden his poll numbers started going down. How about law enforcement? He’s like so bad. In his entire convention, they didn’t even mention, and by the way, something else they did that I think is terrible, really terrible. The words under God, right? Right? Right? Called the Pledge of Allegiance. Under God, he left those two words out twice at their caucus which is part of their convention. But that’s where they’re coming from. He’s trying this, “Oh well we didn’t do this,” and then we gave it to him and he sort of shut up but then two days later he’s saying it didn’t happen. They lie and these mail-in ballots? These mail-in ballots are a disgrace [ 01:08:46].

Sign your mail-in ballot. You sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote, and then if for some reason after that, it shouldn’t take that long, it comes in, they’re not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted. But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they’re going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff. I’m trying to be nice. I’m trying to be nice.

They want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots. Now there have been many races over the last year where they’ve done this and they’ve been a disaster. You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York. She’s not got much going. They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, “What about me?” He’s not too happy, her opponent. You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened … There’s not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control.

they want to send out 80 million unsolicited, I like it much better, they used to say universal, they used to say live ballots, I like the word unsolicited, and solicited. Solicited is okay, because that’s when you’re asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out, that’s okay. But you can’t, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means you’re sitting there. We have a big enthusiasm edge, but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots, they have. Dogs have gotten ballots and they know I’m right and everybody knows I’m right and they say I’m right behind the closed doors and it’s a disgrace, what they do to our country. 80 million unsolicited ballots. People that had no idea. People that weren’t going to vote in all fairness. It’s really unfair because our people have enthusiasm, they’re going out to vote. They’re all going out to vote. Everybody here going to vote? Everybody?

They have no enthusiasm. So I said, “So that’s unfair. That guy walks and then they’ll have somebody knock on the door, say, “Listen, I would like your ballot.” “I don’t want to vote. I don’t care about Biden. I’m a Democrat. I don’t care about this guy.” “Well look, where is it?” “Here take it, blah blah blah.”” They even have a provision where you don’t have to verify signatures. What is going on? And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, that’s where you grab them all together and drop them. In Nevada, they actually have a provision where they don’t have to be counted until seven days after the election. So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope it’s not, I hope we have a landslide like you’ve never seen. But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to, and I love Nevada, I think we’re going to win Nevada, except where they’re sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago. It’s very unfair, it’s very unfair, but think of it. They have seven days after the election. Did you know that Mike? Seven days, what does that mean? I want to see the results of the election on November 3.

By the way, if it’s anything like these other events, it could go on forever. I mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done, they should make that a do-over and I think in Paterson they have a do-over. I think they’re going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud, theft. People were selling ballots, people were selling ballots, and you know they talk about Russia. They’re so worried about Russia. What about sending out 80 million ballots? That’s your real problem, and if Russia or China or these other countries want to cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots. It’s much easier than the way they have to go about it, right? So we have to put pressure on these people.

Now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in Pennsylvania, you know that, right? We have two judges, we have a state judge, we have a federal judge. I think both highly qualified judges from what I understand, I hear that they’re not too happy about what they’re seeing. So we’ll see what happens. We’re going to see what happens. The lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted, and if it’s not counted, vote, and then they have the job, if it comes in late, and if it’s not too late, they have the job of making sure that they don’t count it. But follow that ballot because these people, they’ll be lost, they’ll be gone, the numbers are incredible where they’re 25 and 30% off, 20% off. Follow your ballot.

When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. You know that. You know he always gets up today, “COVID-19, COVID-19.” I say, “Joe, look. We got a country,” and I agree with that and we’ve done a hell of a job. We’ve done a hell of a job. If you look at some of our numbers. You got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking, your place, I mean this is … When you look at Pennsylvania, you’re in a shutdown. You have a governor that has you shut down.

we know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes. People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes. We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up. But the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems. You remember my original statement, right? The cure can’t be greater. It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it’s so true. You have to open up this commonwealth, it has to be opened up. It has to be opened up now.

But there’s what I think they’re doing, because you have the same thing in New York. We have a governor in New York who is 36,000 people died, 11,000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake. He made a horrible mistake, and I built him a convention center with 2,800 beds and they didn’t use it and I sent up a ship, a great hospital ship, a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn’t use it and he requested it and then I said, “You’re not using it. Why aren’t you using it?” He could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship. What a shame.

You look at New York, the restaurants are all closed. It’s so sad for me. I love New York. I grew up in New York, I love New York, I did well in New York, and it’s so sad when I look at what’s happening with New York. It’s all politics. If you kill somebody they don’t prosecute you but they go after political enemies. What’s happening in New York is a terrible thing and the place is dead. No restaurants [ 01:18:00] how long can you do this for?

Restaurant, poor guys. You can’t, how long can you do this for? The people are going to lose their jobs. They’re never going to open again. It’s not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world. It’s a hard business. New York is closed. You’re closed. North Carolina’s closed. Michigan’s … all Democrats. Let me tell you, what’s going to happen on November 4th. They’re going to announce their opening. They’re doing this for political reasons. They are. Right, John?

They’re doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible, going into November 3rd, election day. Then as soon as the election’s over with, win, lose or draw for them, they’re going to open it. They got nothing. You know what? It’s a shame what they’re doing. For political reasons, they’ll be open. You’ll be open on November 4th, but you know what? From your standpoint, it’s very close to the election. It’s very far if you have a restaurant, and you can’t open your restaurant. You can’t open your store. It’s a disgrace and they ought to get together. They ought to do it.

These are Democrat governors in all instances and Democrat mayors. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. We’ve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You never hear that from the fake news. They don’t want to talk to you about it. This is a big country. This is a tougher country to do that with, the European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours.

If you look now, Spain is having a big blow up. France is having a big blow up. Now, we’ve done a great job, we haven’t been given credit for it. He always starts off, COVID-19. That’s all he knows. COVID-19. I said, “What about the economy? What about jobs? What about all the other things we have to do?” All he does, he thinks it’s a weak spot, and actually in theory, if we’re getting a fair shake from those people back there, it’s actually what the job we’ve done is actually a strong spot.

That includes you people, with the ventilators that nobody had. Nobody that needed a ventilator, didn’t get a ventilator. Now we’re supplying them all over the world. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that. You don’t hear these numbers. Cases in the US have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week. Three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials. Would have taken two years for another president. I was going to say a normal president, but they’ll hit me with … A little truth to that too.

Now, but for another president, especially, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic. It was called Swine flu. You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1. He gets it mixed up. No, it’s the H1N1, Joee. Not that it matters, I guess. No. Do you ever notice, he’s always calling it the other. He calls it the opposite. He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, “Oh, if he was,” well he didn’t want the ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China. I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually. Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France. We banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands. If I didn’t do the closing and the opening, so we’re at 175,000, far too … look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and it’s a disgrace.

It’s a disgrace. They could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into China, but not going to the rest of the world, including our country. It’s a disgrace. But think of it. Joe Biden got the worst marks you’ve ever seen for his handling of the H1NI Swine flu. They said it was incompetent, and the head guy, who now he’s trying to retract. It’s a little tough. That’s one great thing about the tape. He said it was horrible. He said, we did a horrible job. He said, they got lucky. It’s not contagious like this. We got, this is a tough one. I can look at that guy and he’ll catch it. Right there, and he’s very far away from me. It’s a tough one, because it’s so contagious.

But the Swine flu is a different thing, but also, nothing’s easy about that, pandemics or epidemics and his marks … Take a look at the job they did. It was so bad that their top person criticized it, and they went after him. They said, “Don’t ever say that again,” but it’s a little late. He said it was one of the worst jobs, and we actually had a Gallup poll where we got very high marks for the job we did. They had a poll where it was so low, it wasn’t recordable. Then he’s coming along and telling us how to solve this very difficult problem. We’ve done a great job and I don’t want the credit, but I want the people, Mike Pence [ 01:23:20] .

I tell you what, our Vice-President, Mike Pence, and the task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, they’ve done a fantastic job and they just get no credit. If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, they’d say it was one of the greatest jobs they’ve ever seen. But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu. It was a disaster. It was incompetent. They called themselves incompetent. They call, and now they’re coming in like, well, we would have done this and Biden by the way, was against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China.

Then two months later, two and a half, three, and Nancy Pelosi was having dances in Chinatown, right? A month later. No, no problem. I was way ahead. Then Biden comes out and he actually said that I was right, but they said, “Don’t say that, try doing it a little softer than that.” He did it a little bit softer, but we were right. They were wrong. They handled it so badly. Just take a look, because we, I said to my people, “We’ve got to fight this a little bit differently because we’re getting a lot of fake news, a lot of bad people saying things”, and you look at the stats and you look at how we’ve done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries, it’s amazing.

If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are. I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. By the way, just today, there’s another credible thing happening. Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly. Incredible.

Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about. This would have been years later. It’ll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October. How do you like that? Wouldn’t that be nice? That would be nice. You know why? Not because of the electric. It’ll be nice because we want to save people. That’s why it’ll be nice. That’s the important thing. Together, we will defeat the virus. The job we’re doing is, the job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators.

Very tough. The ventilator’s very complicated, very big, very expensive. It’s like, I made the statement, it’s like building a car, but more sophisticated. They said, “No, it’s not.” They said, they took a ventilator. They took it apart. These people are the worst, the worst. Over the next four years, we’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s what we’ll do. Let me just tell you something. If they didn’t waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done. Would have all been done, truly.

It would have all been done. Yet, with all of this stuff, the fake Russia witch hunt, the fake Ukraine. How about that? Did anybody read the transcript of that call? It was a perfect call. “Hey, congratulations. Good luck.” It was like a perfect call. Now they’ll take it back and they’ll say, “Well, I don’t know.” This was a per … In history, there’s never been anything like this. It was a totally lopsided, 100% political witch hunt, and it goes on and on. These are bad people. I really believe they don’t love our country. I watched Nancy Pelosi. “You must wear your mask. You have to wear your mask, and we’re going to keep every beauty salon closed in California and all over the country.”

Then I see a picture. I say, “Nancy Pelosi. Well, where’s the mask?” I’ll tell you what. She must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly. She uses the salon and the salon turned her in? The salon turned her in. I don’t think I would have turned her in. I would’ve said, “Well, you know, she’s a customer. I got to take care of my customers, right?” But she made them open, and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her. How much do they hate Nancy Pelosi? Then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can’t be set up. She said, “I was set up. I was set up by the salon owner. I was set up.”

I said, “Tell me she didn’t say that, please.” I just put out, that if she was set up, then she shouldn’t be leading the House of Representatives. I want the salon owner to lead the House of Representatives, because she set up … Think of it. She set up the Speaker of the House. That was a big mistake. As soon as I heard, she said, “Well, she’s sent me up,” Nancy, you’re not supposed to get set up. You’re representing our country. You know what she should have done honestly? She should have said, “I made a mistake, sorry,” and nobody would be talking about, this is like the biggest story. This is the big, crazy Nancy, highly overrated person.

Let me just say she is a highly overrated person. They give her such good play. She is a highly overrated person. Look, they just turned off a camera because they don’t want me saying that. Just in closing, we will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement. Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We don’t want surprise medical billing. You know what happens? It’s terrible, but we have ended it. Also, we’ve signed something that’s incredible. You’re going to see. Some people say it’s bigger than healthcare, and I signed it. Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st. You better elect me. You better elect me. It’s called price transparency.
I said to my people at the end of the day, what is price transparency? This is going to lower your prices by 50%. You’ll be able to negotiate. You’ll be able to do things you’re not even allowed to do now, with hospitals, with doctors. You get better doctors, you get lower prices. I said, “When does it start?” It’s a complicated … Oh, did I get, I was fought. You have no idea. Right fellows? You have fought too. But they fought me on this price transparency. It’s bigger than healthcare, could be bigger than healthcare. But I said, “When does it start?” They said, “Sir, we have it all set.” “When?” “January 1st,” “I said, I’d better win this election,” because you’re going to see some unbelievable price reductions. That includes on drugs, because we’re reducing health insurance premiums massively, and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years, last year.

But now it’s going to go down very big, because we did a favorite nation’s clause. I see the drug companies are, they’re killing me with ads. They have nothing but cash. They have nothing but money. They’re spending because they can’t believe … Germany and other countries pay much less than we do. We want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices. That’s what it is called, favored nation clause. I instituted a favorite, so we’re paying $2.50 for a pill, and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right? We get the 25 cent price. So, what’s going to happen that’ll go up. Ours will come way down.

They can’t believe it. The drug companies can’t believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff. Where’s Mark? They want to negotiate. They called. We signed it. It’s all done. They want to negotiate and they are negotiating, so let’s see what happens, but we’re going to get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which you’ve never seen. We’ll protect Medicare and Social Security. They will not be able to protect it. It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always.

America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was dead. Now it’s the most vibrant space center in the world, by far. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and we’ll teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God, We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania.
From Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, from Erie to Easton, and from Bethlehem to right here in Arnold Palmer’s beloved Latrobe. I love Arnold Palmer. Arnold, where are you? We love Arnold. There was only one Arnold. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. Pennsylvania is the state where our founding fathers declared American Independence, right? Declared American Independence. Add the word Commonwealth in there. This way, they won’t us. It’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything.

I haven’t been keeping up with it. What did he do? George Washington, they want the name off. Congressman are we okay showing … I don’t think you liked that idea too much. George Washington. They want his name off everything, but we’ll keep it. I promise you this. As long as you canceled culture, you better have a strong president. Canceled culture. George Washington, can you believe? But he led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. This is the Commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg and where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mined the coal, worked the railroads, forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world. That’s in the history of the world and we are making it greater than it’s ever been before. That’s what’s going to happen. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country from these very, very deranged people. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving like never before. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, and together we will work very hard.

The people of Pennsylvania, the great, great people of Pennsylvania, where I went to college. It’s a place I know very well. But, we will make America wealthy. Again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania.",3/9/20

Well, thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I’m thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don’t know how many people here, but there’s a lot. We said let’s keep it down. They didn’t do too good a job, but that’s good. That’s good. Now these crowds, I tell you it’s beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot.

This is the most important election we’ve ever had. 56 days from now, we’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don’t think you has a bigger difference and maybe you’ve never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don’t want to say it because I’ll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children’s future to countries like China.

Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It’s as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we’ve opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it’s you it’s Michigan, it’s a couple of others. They’re closed. New York. Look what they’re doing in New York, what they’re doing to our beautiful New York.

It’s so sad. But you just take a look at what’s going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it’s a shame what’s going on. And I’ll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They’re doing it for political reasons. They’re doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you’re hurting the economy.

Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it’s not only is it a V, it’s a super V. You see what’s happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It’s down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we’re opening it up and your state should go with it. We’re opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It’s going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we’re going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over.

And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody’s taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven’t seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They’re Biden people. They’re Biden states and cities. They’re Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that.

A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody’s ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We’re going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We’re saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We’ll straighten it out in less than a half an hour.

Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I’ll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It’ll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing.

If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn’t mean that’s going to stop. He doesn’t, he will never stop. If they win, it’s not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let’s face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That’s why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don’t think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn’t. So I’m running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You’ve seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you’ve never seen. They weren’t even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it’s got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home.

They said, no, you’ve got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we’re bringing them home. We’re bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don’t like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we’re doing it again and we’re on track to have, as I said, the best year we’ve ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We’ve created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months.

Next year will be the single greatest economic year in the history of our country and probably in the history of your state, if your governor ever opens up. But hopefully you’re going to have Dan Forrest. You’re not going to have [ 00:09:31]. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won’t even know the difference. How’s the economy? Not good, sir. We’re in a depression. We are? What’s that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I’ve spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country.

We’ve never had so many jobs. We’re up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they’re doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order.

You want to knock them down? That’s fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we’ll do it easily. We’ll do it through the process because they don’t want to spend 10 years. You know, they’d look at it. They’d say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we’re talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there.

But I said that was going to happen. Don’t worry about it. You don’t have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It’s like a free fall. You know what, people don’t like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country.

Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America’s borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We’re going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They’ve been doing it. They’ve been destroying suburbs. We’re not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how’s Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don’t like Trump.

I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don’t, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we’re doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What’s this all about?

Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn’t think it, but I’ll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don’t understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again.

Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We’re not shutting it down again. We don’t have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don’t realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It’s clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we’ve never seen before.

That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening. And never forget, they’re coming after me because I’m fighting for you. There’s a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it’s something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I’m saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don’t know about a limp. I don’t have a limp. Hey, someday, I’m going to have a limp. I’ll let you know when. You’ll see it. No, they make this stuff up.

They make it up. They make stuff. It’s called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There’s nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you’d have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they’d be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it’s treason or whatever else you want to call it.

And it’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. It’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don’t you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he’s going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I’m telling you, you’d have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It’s a disgrace, but let’s see what happens. Biden’s a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities.

And you know, he talks about like, well, he’s going to do this. He’s going to … He doesn’t have any idea. He has no clue. He’s going to do this. He’s been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he’s been there for 47 years. I’m going to do this. After 47 years, he’s had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest … Look, somebody said, what’s the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She’s meaner, probably not as nice.

I don’t know. You can’t get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she’s smarter than he is. Okay. He’s a nicer person, but he’s not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party’s nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who’s further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race.

Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don’t know. Maybe we’ll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don’t quite get it, but you always pick somebody that’s hot. That’s going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I’m not sure. I don’t think I’ve ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away.

One thing about Bernie, he’s the greatest loser I’ve ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they’ve heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don’t know who I’d rather run against. One is super left.

The other one’s had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He’s half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they’re united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That’s why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it’s over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We’re doing great.

And we don’t have crime and we don’t have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They’re actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York’s gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what’s happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why?

Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you’re campaigning, you can’t have more than five people. They-

That if you’re campaigning you can’t have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can’t go to church anymore. You can’t go to church. You can’t go to church, you can’t do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you’re willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you’re willing to riot and stand on top of each other’s face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you’re allowed to do that because you’re considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests.

Instead of standing up to the far left rioters, Biden condemns law enforcement and condemns America. Didn’t even mention the words that we love and respect, law and order. You know [ 00:21:51] even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don’t listen to too much, maybe I should. “Sir, please don’t say law and order. That’s too tough.” Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, “Say law and order but with safety.” I said, “Look, people get it. It’s just law and order, is that okay?” We want law and order. They say, “Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it’s …” I said, “I don’t want to add.” It’s sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order.

Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I’ve gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he’s starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what’s going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what’s going on. Now he’s starting to say, “No, we need law and order.” No he didn’t say that, did he? He’ll never get to say that, can’t say that because then it’d lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at … You don’t want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don’t want to be dealing.

Meanwhile Biden, he doesn’t say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They’re murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you’re sitting there. You’ll be taking your monuments down. You’ll be taking your statues down. I’m not kidding, you’ll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I’m just telling you, go get it, you wouldn’t even believe it. It’s too crazy to even talk about, but we’re never going to give them a chance to do it. We’re never giving them a chance. We’re going to win, we’re going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way …

By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, “Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?” There’s something really … The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we’re doing great there. Now the governor decides we’re doing so well that they’re going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They’re going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you’ll ask for a ballot. That’s a solicited ballot. It’s okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That’s the only way.

Look at this. If Joe Biden came here and made a … This is not the most convenient place. It’s an airport. Hi fellas. They did a good job guiding the plane. They’re great. They’re great. No, really. This is an airport. Honestly, I really … If he had 200 people, I think it would be a lot. I really mean it. You ever see the gyms with the circles? That’s his crowd. If he had 200 people. I was told we have 15,000 people here tonight. [ 00:25:57] as far as the eye can see, but they’ll correct it. They’ll say, “He’s wrong, it was 14,500, he’s misrepresenting. He’s misrepresenting.” Now I was told we have 15,000 and we’re in the middle of an airport someplace. It’s a wonderful thing. I actually think … I don’t know if you agree.

So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren’t working out too well, right? You can’t really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we’re rounding the turn on that but because of that … So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We’re doing all mostly hangar things because we’re outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it’s very much different.

So we’re doing these and we’re doing the outdoors, we’re doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It’s pretty amazing. It’s pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, “Look, let’s have 1,000 people,” and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We’re trying to be nice but then eventually we landed … Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it’s really amazing what’s going on. All over the country, it’s amazing. It’s amazing. It’s a great thing.

More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, “I don’t know. That’s a lot of …” You know what? I’ve actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I’ve done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That’s something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard.

But what we’ve done … You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It’s exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. “Sir, we have to be able to see through.” I said, “All right, let’s go. Much more expensive.” I said, “Let’s go.” So we’re over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we’ve ever had by far and it’s a good time to have it too.
 
You know Mexico is paying for the wall just so you understand. They don’t say that. They never say it, but we’re going to charge a small fee at the border, the toll booths. We have toll booths. It’s the biggest border in the world in terms of people going across and in terms of industry, believe it or not, the southern border. We’re putting a small toll on and maybe we’re going to do something with remittance. That’s when people come here, make money and they send it back, so we’ll do something and we’re going to get all the money that we spent on the wall will be coming back so … Remember I used to say who’s going to pay for it? They’d say Mexico [ 00:29:47]? That’s right. Mexico is going to pay for it.

What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It’s going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall’s going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don’t put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president’s been great, he’s a friend of mine, he’s doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico’s not easy, but he’s doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it’s a tremendous wall. It’s everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, “What else do you want?” It’s wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, “We don’t want a wall, we want drones flying.” Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right?

Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they’ve ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about … We will federalize them, we’ll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they’re finally, after 107 days, like they’re finally doing what they’re supposed to be doing but we’ll let you know very soon. Otherwise we’re going in.
 
The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie’s a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they’re ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don’t. They don’t have a clue. They just know they’re being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That’s a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don’t lose it.

Because we’ve really implemented things. We’ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China’s never given us $0.10. It’s a one-way street with China. They haven’t given us … We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn’t dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It’s a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they’re smart, very smart. Instead of saying he’s not talking very nicely about us and we’re not going to order any more, we’re not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders … Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that’s what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody’s ever done this before. Nobody’s ever done this before. With Biden it’s the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he’ll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them.

So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers.

You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, “That’s a big number, right?” I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they’re only lying if it’s us because they don’t want to be bothered. In other words they’re not lying about Sleepy Joe, they’re lying about us, and I don’t know if I’m supposed to love that or hate it, I don’t know if it’s an insult or not but I will take it. We don’t give a damn. If that’s the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it.

We’re joined tonight by some really great friends of mine, representatives, senators, just some incredible people. People that have really helped me and we have to get them in office and let’s start off with Senator Thom Tillis. Thom, thank you. He’s been by my side. Thank you Thom very much. Representatives Greg Murphy, Virginia Foxx, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Ted Budd, what a group. What a group. What a group, thank you fellas. They’re warriors. Boy I’ll tell you, those House guys, they were in there, they were fighting for us. We’re 196 to nothing, right? When Crazy Nancy impeached us, right? They impeached me for making a phone call that was perfect, it was a perfect call. I’ll go down as the only president in history that got impeached for making an absolutely perfect phone call. Thank goodness I had the call because they totally misrepresented what was on the calla. If you ever heard the Shifty Schiff get up in Congress and say what I said, [ 00:36:17] it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn’t have it, somehow with these people I guess I’d still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy’s done a fantastic job. He really has.

With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He’s not too popular, I want to tell you, he’s not a very popular guy in Utah. He’s not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He’s a beauty, I’ll tell you that guy. He couldn’t get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it’s too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group.

Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I’ll tell you he’ll be a great governor. He loves your state, he’ll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you’re going to do well, Dan. I know you’re really getting up there, it’s getting very close. I’ll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you’re allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you’re not supposed to have political rallies. I said, “You know the money that your state is going to be losing?” But if this guy doesn’t open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn’t open up your state, you have no choice, you’re going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you’ll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote.

The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O’Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don’t like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don’t like it. I look at these crowds and if they’re going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they’re going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We’re going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we’re going to win Florida.

North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where’s Mick? Oh, I didn’t know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He’s doing a great job, Robert O’Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We’re 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you’d never even heard of and it’s been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it’s good to see you.

Oh wait a minute, wait. It’s a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I’m lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That’s good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We’ve achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that’s driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost –

That was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that. Your family lost the farm, lost their small business because they had to go and pay this ridiculous estate tax or death tax as they call it. And now you don’t have to worry about it. If you love your children, you leave it to them. If you don’t love your children, then it doesn’t matter what I did. Don’t leave it to them, give it to charity, give it to someone else. If they’re not good to you, if you don’t love… But does anybody here not love their children? Please raise your hand. You. Nobody. Good. I love that. Look at that one. You’re going to love that one, I guarantee. I guarantee you’re going to love that one. That’s a keeper. That’s a keeper, right? That’s great. You’ll love that one. Someday in a long time from now that beautiful child will not have to worry about estate taxes unless the Democrats do something in between, but we [ 00:42:53].

No, but it was a terrible thing. You’d pass away and your kids would get the farm, they’d go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They’d put big mortgages on the farm, they’d lose the farm, they’d lose the business. You don’t have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he’s changed. He’s changed. “After 47 years I’ve changed. I swear to you I’ve changed.” Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that’s okay. He was better against Bernie. Something’s going on there, I don’t know. You know what I’m talking about. But he was better against Bernie.

But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization. That’s courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it’s been incredible. Everyone said, “Impossible.” They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done.

And it’s a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with… It’s such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I’d see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they’d make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn’t work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA.

In the face of China’s economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we’re not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it’s just been this way for 20 years. Now, it’s going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn’t do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn’t do that, I think you wouldn’t have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, “Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?” He said, “Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.”

So I said, “28, okay, that’s fine.” I said, “We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.” And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want… And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what’s going to happen? They’re just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don’t want them to be in trouble, but they’re going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they’re going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it’ll be.

They’re dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. “Let’s wait two months, maybe we’ll get lucky. Maybe we’re going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we’re going to make a great deal.” No, there’ll be in immediately after the election and they’ll make a deal, we’ll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration’s war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don’t want to buy energy. We’ve done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don’t want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don’t you? And I’m sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it’s below $2. You said, “How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.” Right? Thank you President Trump

And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it’s called the green new nightmare. While I’m president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don’t have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We’ve been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don’t have to be in the Middle East. We don’t need… There was a time we needed desperately, we don’t need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn’t that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It’s America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn’t do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It’s too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden.

And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we’re heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren’t interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I’ve been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, “There’s no way he got worse than me.” But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it’s fake. It’s totally fake. But nobody’s been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let’s see what happens. We caught them cold. Let’s see what happens. But if we didn’t have to… That takes time, and energy, and all other things.

The time that we spent on this impeachment hoax, Nancy Pelosi with her hairdryer and the whole thing. “Everybody has to wear a mask. You must keep all beauty parlors closed.” Then she’s in a beauty parlor with no mask on. And then she said the biggest, the biggest [ 00:10:31]. She could have said, “Okay.” She could have said, “You got me.” But she said, “I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,” who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, “I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.” I said, “How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?” No, it’s terrible, she’s always preaching about the mask. “You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.” I’ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I’m reelected the best is yet to come. I’ll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, “Walls are old fashioned. They don’t work.” Really? I always say, and I’ve said it four or five times. I’ll say it again if you’d like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you’re lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn’t it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall.

Maybe I’m wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we’ve ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades.

Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, “Let me see that one.” Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it’s Israel, as you see, and as you’ve read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It’s going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn’t Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him.

The world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home. We’re bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn’t find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn’t find him, they looked, they couldn’t find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible.

Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we’ve had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, “No, we don’t have to bother. This is going to be…” And now we have to work against a guy that doesn’t know where he is, I can’t believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, “No, no, no, you don’t have to do that.” But I said, “We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they’re coming here,” so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move.

If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won’t take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn’t even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We’re delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don’t know that because the fake news doesn’t want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we’re going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that’s incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That’s what they’re talking about. So now they know we have it. It’s only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, “That’s a great thing. We’re going to save lives,” they’re trying to disparage it, they’re trying to make it politics. They’re trying to do so. And now what’s going to happen is we’ll have it, and people won’t want to take it. That’s really bad. Okay? That’s really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we’re close to putting it out, getting it out, and we’re going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it’ll be effective and it’ll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that.

Joe Biden’s plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that’s what you’re in right now. You’re in a shutdown. It’s crazy. I’ve been to many states, they’re not in shutdowns and they’re doing better. They’re doing better. Somebody’s got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, “You don’t know what the hell you’re doing? You don’t know what you’re doing. They’re hurting our people.” North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school.

You ever see the statistics on young people? I don’t know. They have a great immune system. Let’s get some of that immune system, but they’re amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they’re not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It’s an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we’ve saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save-

… And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state’s tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn’t build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we’ll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you’re going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You’re not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down.

He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn’t believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they’re gone. And they’ve been incredible.

In the second term I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we’ll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I’ve been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you’re doing when you have all of these advantages, when you’re giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn’t think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You’re just bringing people in and we don’t want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple.

We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We’ll build up our military like it’s never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them… We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had by far.

We’ll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I’ve already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I’ve cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody’s ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy’s president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn’t you start it sooner, but statutorily that’s when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy’s in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they’ll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I’m instituting favorite nations laws. So we’re going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you’rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world.

We’ll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it’s the number one space center in the world by far. You see what’s going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I’m talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I’m talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That’s a great group behind me. I don’t know. They’re activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That’s why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It’s guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, “You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.” And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, “Someday it’s going to be Robert Lee, someday it’s going to be Washington, someday it’s going to be Lincoln. Someday it’s going to be Jefferson, someday it’s going to be Benjamin Franklin. It’s all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That’s the way they do it. You study it. That’s the way they go. They take away your guts.

We’ll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they’re like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it’s always like this. They love our country and we’re not going to disappoint anybody. We’re not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America… So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn’t say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they’ve gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we’re going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting… Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again.

If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some… We’re far ahead of what I had planned. We’re far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn’t do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won’t believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, “Wow, things are going really well.” It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it’ll happen again. There’ll be great unity, eventually there’ll be great unity.

So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it’s from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. singing)",8/9/20

Well, thank you very much and I’m thrilled to be back at the historic Jupiter Inlet, I know it very well. Don’t live very far away as you know. The lighthouse, it’s, my home state is called the state of Florida and it’s a great state. Hello Ed. Sit down. Do you have seats? Yeah, you do sit down everybody. The sunshine state is truly one of the most beautiful places on earth. I love it. And together we will preserve its breathtaking natural splendor for generations to come. We’re here today to celebrate our incredible record of natural conservation and environmental protection. Over the last four years I’ve been working with your both governors, your last governors, your current governor is fantastic by the way and we’ve been working very, very hard. We’ve been working very hard together to make sure everything is perfect and to recommit ourselves to preserving the awesome majesty of God’s great creation.

Joining us in the wonderful support effort of that mission is secretary of the interior, a man who’s worked so hard in this, David Bernhardt. Thank you very much, David. Thank you. And EPA administrator, very powerful, man. When he says you can do it, you do it when he says you can’t it’s over with, you don’t have a chance, Andrew Wheeler. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you. Great job. And of course your governor Ron DeSantis, who’s run, not only did he run a great campaign, he’s a great governor. Thanks Ron. What a great job. What a great job he did. Of course we’ll let you know on November 3rd, I’ll let you know if he did a good job, okay?

Also, I want to introduce Lieutenant Governor, Jeanette Nunez who’s been such a fantastic friend and supporter. Thank you very much, Jeanette. And one of the great attorney generals, anywhere in the country, Ashley Moody. Ashley, thank you. Thank you very much. Florida CFO, Jimmy Patronis. Jimmy, thank you, Jimmy, great job. A man who everybody loves, he’s highly respected in Washington, he’s a great Senator, Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. Thank you, Lindsey. Great job. Representatives Gus Bilirakus, where’s Gus? Gus, how are you, Gus? Thank you very much. Great job you’re doing. We have a lot of good ones here. We have warriors. I call them my warriors, that’s what they are, and Gus, the job you’ve done and Matt Gaetz, Where’s Matt? Where is Matt? Where is Matt? That’s not a very good location for you, Matt, I’m used to having you sitting right up here. What’s going on? That’s good. Matt Gaetz, Brian Mast. Brian, fantastic guy. Thank you, Brian.

They are our warriors. You see what they do. They have to fight Pelosi, Schumer, they have to fight all these characters and they do very well in the fights. We want them on our site, Greg Stuby, Greg, thank you very much. Great job. Great job this morning, I watched. Bill Posey. Bill? Bill Posey, thank you, Bill. Michael Waltz. Michael, fantastic, Michael. And Ted Yoho, They’ve actually become my friends, actually. Ted, thank you very much. Great, great. Where’s Ted? Great Ted, thank you very much. Great job. And from South Carolina, state representative Nancy Mace, who’s got a very important race where I think you’re doing very well. I think you’re doing very well from what I hear, right? You got to win that one. That’s an important one. We’re behind you 1000%. You know that right? As well as mayor of Miami Dade County, Carlos Gimenez, where’s Carlos? Carlos, great.

I want to thank you all for being here. My administration’s proving every day that we can improve our environment while creating millions of high paying jobs. This is a really sharp contrast to the extreme, radical left that you’ve had to deal with and what you’re doing right now is a lot better than anything you’ve ever been accustomed to, I will tell you that. Joe Biden’s plan would destroy America’s middle class while giving a free pass to the world’s worst foreign polluters like China, Russia, India, and many others. They don’t have to clean up their lands, but we have to clean up ours. The left’s agenda isn’t about protecting the environment, it’s about punishing America and that’s true. Instead of focusing on radical ideology, my administration is focused on delivering real results and that’s what we have and we right now have the cleanest air we’ve ever had in this country. Let’s say over the last 40 years, because I assume 200 years ago was probably better. What do you think? I would say that. What do you think the fellas? So I do want to preface that because the fake news is back there. When I say the cleanest air we’ve ever had over a 40 year period, Lindsay, is that okay? A couple of hundred years ago, I would imagine it was pretty good, right?

To safeguard our stunning coastal areas, I signed legislation authorizing $100 million to fight the red tide and toxic algae and to preserve the Everglades and defend Florida from catastrophic flooding. You know about the flooding. We spent a lot of money on flooding and a lot of money on hurricanes and when your governors came to me and they said, “Can we have this? Can we have that? We need some more for the Panhandle,” they said, “We have to help the panhandle.” I said, “Without question and without any wait, let’s go.” Right? That’s what we said. You’ve never had it so easy in your life. He’d walk into my office, say, “Sir, just one more.” “How much is it going to cost? How about an extra billion?”
Yeah, my staff wasn’t too thrilled. We had to override the staff a couple of times. We’ve directed over a half, a billion dollars to fix the Herbert Hoover Dike and Lake Okeechobee, Lake Okeechobee.

We fixed it up good, Mr. Mayor, we did a good job. Did a good job. We will now compete with this project and we’re way ahead, we are way ahead, about three years, I think, ahead of schedule from what the original time of completion was going to be and I’m in particular happy with what we’ve done on Lake Okeechobee. I know it well, I know it well.

Everyone said that one couldn’t be done, Ron, you know that right? They said it would never happen. You’ll never get it funded. It’s a big deal and it’s all gotten done, including the tide is gone, will be gone, finally from all of the problems that they’ve had with it.

We’ve expanded funding for the Everglades restoration by over 55% compared to four years ago and I also want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers for their vital work on the C44 Reservoir and the help, they are unbelievable. One thing, when they build it, I said, “You know you could do it a little bit less expensive than that. The walls don’t have to be seven feet thick. They could be two feet thick,” but you know when the Army Corps of Engineers do it, they do it right. That’s one thing I can tell you. We’re building the wall, the wall along Mexico, between Mexico and the United States. We’re over 300 miles now of wall and that’s a serious wall. That’s a wall that’s meant to last and meant to work, but that’ll help revitalize the wetlands in the St. Lucie River estuary and the Indian River lagoon.

Whoa, that’s pretty good. We hit home with that one, huh?

But today I have a very important announcement. I don’t know if it’s bigger than the things we just announced or the things that we’ve already done or we’re in the process of completing. In a few moments I will sign a presidential order extending the moratorium on offshore drilling on Florida’s Gulf Coast and expanding it to Florida’s Atlantic coast, as well as the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina.

thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

Thank you very much. I guess you like that one the best of all. This action follows close consultation with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he’s been unbelievable, Florida Senators Marco Rubio, and Rick Scott, they’ve worked so hard, as well as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott. Lindsey, thank you. Lindsay liked the idea right from the beginning. I said, “What do you think?” It took you, how long? About two seconds to say I like it. The Governor of South Carolina, a great man and a really great governor, Henry McMaster and I also want to thank the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, he’s doing a fantastic job and a Senator who from day one, he’s been with me, Senator David Perdue, Georgia, and Senator Kelly Loefler and Congressman Doug Collins and South Carolina State Representative Nancy Mace. Again, I want to thank you all, incredible.

Thanks to my administration’s pro-American energy policies we can take this step and the next step while remaining the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, we’re the largest producer now in the world by far. We’re number one in the world and we are energy independent, which is a nice…

With fracking, the shale revolution and the tremendous surge in American energy production, we’re showing that we can create jobs, safeguard the environment and keep energy prices low for America and low for our citizens and you see that, you also see it when you pump the gas into your car and you’re paying sometimes a lot less than $2.00 Lately, right? So we’re doing well and we have so much of it. I don’t know, we got more than everybody, anybody ever thought possible, right? That’s really incredible what’s happened. The approach of Joe Biden and the radical left is exactly the opposite. Their policies will destroy jobs, cause energy prices to double and triple and quadruple, to skyrocket beyond belief and the environment will be badly hurt. If you go by that, badly, badly hurt, it will be injured and permanently injured. And very importantly, they’ll take away our energy independence and they’ll do it quickly and they won’t even know what happened to them.

We’re dealing with some smart customers. They know exactly what to do, and they don’t like it when we’re energy independent. They don’t like it at all. So it’s been a really amazing thing for Florida from the environmental standpoint, and I have to tell you, from the energy standpoint and from a very important level of cost. You’re at a level of cost now with your electric and with so many other things caused and created by energy and fuel, the likes of which you haven’t seen in 30 years. As president I’ll defend our environment, I’ll defend our workers and our cherished way of life. Last month I signed the great American outdoors act, the most significant investment in our national parks in over a century, since Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt.

You know, they came to my office, a lot of the senators that I just introduced and Ron and everybody, they came to my office they said that, “This will make us and make you the number one environmental president since Teddy Roosevelt.” I said, “Huh, that sounds good.” Because I wasn’t going to do it. I figured, you know, let’s not do it. But when they said that, that was like a challenge. So I said, “Well, why does it only have to go back to Teddy Roosevelt, which is over a hundred years? Why can’t we say from George Washington? Right from the beginning?” They said, “Well, we’re not quite there yet,” but one other bill like this we’ll be there, Lindsay, you know that right? But it’s true, number one, since Teddy Roosevelt, who would’ve thought, Trump is the great environmentalist. You hear that, Ed? You hear that? That’s good. And I am. I am. I believe strongly in it.

Through this legislation, we’re providing nearly $10 billion for long delayed maintenance projects in our national parks and Florida has helped as much as anybody and maybe more. My administration has fully or partially cleaned up 61 EPA superfund pollution sites that were rotting all over our country. Far more than Obama and Biden. No matter how far you go back, more than any administration. Since my inauguration we’ve recovered more endangered or threatened species than any other administration has accomplished in its first term. Earlier this year, I announced that the United States would joined the one trillion trees initiative. We already have one billion trees pledged to be planted and it’s moving very rapidly. We’ve opened land-

As the last administration pursued its globalist agenda abroad, they were all over the place. They were everywhere but here, in our country. They were taking care of other lands, countries that you never heard of, they were taking care of and they didn’t do a good job there either. They neglected the fundamentals of public health right here in the United States, right here in our home. My administration is focused on ensuring crystal clean air and water. Under my administration we’ve seen a significant drop in air pollution since 2017, a very significant drop for the first time in nearly 30 years. We are strengthening standards to prevent vulnerable children from being exposed to lead and copper in drinking water, including in our schools. They were exposed to lead and copper in drinking water. We’ve done some job with that, that was an important one. And we’ve invested over $38 billion in drinking water infrastructure to care for our children. I’m committed to ensuring the United States has the cleanest air and cleanest water on earth.

The contrast between our vision and the radical left has never been more clear. They talk a big game and they do nothing. That’s really what it is, too. They talk and talk the environment, they talk and talk, nothing happens. It’s all talk. It’s all words and no action. You ever hear that?

To our political opponents, environmental policy is just an excuse to advance a socialist platform that will impose trillions and trillions of dollars in new taxes and send our jobs overseas, making it impossible to open up new companies and to live less expensively. Your energy costs would be four or five, sometimes even under scenarios, 10 times more expensive. And, really, you wouldn’t even have energy. To my administration, environmental protection is a sacred obligation and so it is our duty to fight for the dreams and livelihoods of the citizens we serve and to the citizens of Florida that I know so well and that I love, this is my home. This is my home.

We’re rapidly restoring the greatest economy in history. We created the greatest economy in the history of our country, and then we had to close it up when the China plague came in, we closed it up. We saved millions of lives. We banned highly infected China from coming in, it was highly infected. The people were highly infected. Wu Han province, we banned them. Nobody said do it, everybody said I shouldn’t do it. Biden said, “Don’t do it,” three months later he admitted I was right. But we banned people, we would have lost hundreds of thousands more, but we would have lost millions if we didn’t close it up and now we open it up and we’re setting records at every single level. So we’re maintaining that pristine resource of beautiful, clean environment at every single community in Florida and all over the country. We’ll always defend the Everglades and we will always safeguard the magnificent Florida coastline. We’ll expand access for fishermen and sportsmen, we’ll uphold your right to hunt and we will protect your right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment.

And I can tell you this, if Joe Biden gets in, he’ll have nothing to say about it. He’s not, let’s face it. Joe shot. If Joe Biden gets in, your second amendment is gone. It’s gone, either obliterated to a point of being gone or gone itself, okay? You will not have a second amendment. And the pressure put on me in the last four years to make massive changes to the second amendment, which would have really rendered it worthless, Ron knows, Ron knows. The pressure put on me, very few people would have been able to withstand that pressure. They would have made big, big cuts and big changes. Your second amendment will remain powerful, will remain strong, will remain with you.

We will reassure our critical supply chains and we will bring back jobs in factories from China and other foreign polluters and everything we do will be guided by our love of this state, its people and its priceless natural treasures. It’s a great state. From its breathtaking beaches to its shimmering bays, from its vast marshes, all those beautiful marshes, marshlands, to its wild forests, there is truly no place on earth like the great state of Florida.

I can tell you, I am so happy to have helped because when I was first elected, you had things that were in such bad shape and now they’re fixed or being fixed at a cost of a lot of money, but they’re either fixed or being fixed and soon there’ll be in better condition than they were the day they were built, which was many, many decades ago. We have things that were built a long time ago that were in a state of disrepair that you wouldn’t believe. As long as I’m president of the United States, we will conserve this wondrous national inheritance from Key West to Key Biscayne, from Tampa to Tallahassee, from the Pensacola, beautiful Pensacola, I love Pensacola. I think it was 97%, that’s one of the reasons I like it. They say, “How’d you do in Pensacola?” I said, “Was that maybe 95? 97?” Right up there, so that helps. It’s amazing how that can help, isn’t it? Right here to Jupiter, which I know very well, we’ll preserve this glorious land for our children, for our grandchildren and for every generation of American to come.

And I will now sign this order. It’s an order that does so much for the state of Florida. It’s an order that I’m so proud to sign. I’ve been talking about this with Ron and with all of the people I’ve mentioned for a long time and I said, we want to get it done and this protects your beautiful Gulf and your beautiful ocean and it will for a long time to come. So, congratulations to Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and, frankly, North Carolina. But I want to just thank everybody for being here and this is a true honor for me to sign this order. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that, right?
Long time, it’s been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years, and we’re going to bring you a lot more. That’s happening. Hello, Michigan and I’m thrilled to be in Freeland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Fifty-four days from now, we’re going to win Michigan, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House.
This is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigan’s jobs, outsourcing-
We shouldn’t be smiling about it, but we’ve changed it around. Outsourcing Michigan’s factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children’s future to China and other far away lands. Biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China, and DPP. You know that. Joe Biden surrendered your jobs to China and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you’re seeing that every night.
If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchist, arsonist and flag burners win.
But I wouldn’t worry about it because he’s not winning. I don’t think he’s winning.
This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that. The same thing happened four years ago. It was election eve but by the time I got here, it was late. Some of you are in that audience at one o’clock in the morning now election day. We had 32,000 people show up and the reason I went is that I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama were traveling to Michigan because they heard they had problems. They were supposed to win Michigan, but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes. They came and I heard about it. They said, “Sir, could you do it?” I hopped in the plane. We landed at 12 o’clock in the evening. I started speaking at one o’clock in the morning now election day. 32,000 people. She had 500 people. I said, “Why are we going to lose Michigan?” And we didn’t. And we didn’t.

First time in a long time, but now we’re up in the polls. We just saw polls. We’re up in Michigan. I don’t know if that’s good or bad. I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time, we won. So maybe we’re better off being down a little bit. Hello, John James. I see you handsome guy. John James, get out and vote for John. I’m going to introduce you in a second John James. What a job you’ve done. I have to tell you, he took, I saw this group of people that were running, all nice people, three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all. Right? I saw them all and I said, “Wait.”

With the wonderful invention of TiVo, one of the greats, you can play it back. I said, “Who was that?” He said, “I don’t know, sir.” I said, “Play it back.” I said, “That man is going to be a star.” It was John James. That was in the Republican primary. After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter, and he’s a great, and actually a great flyer I heard the other day, a great one, a really good one as opposed to those that aren’t so good, but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did. I said, “This guy” and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship. Frankly, if he had a little more support, he would have won the last time. This time, I hear you’re even, and maybe even ahead, and we’re going to win with John James. He’s a great guy, but I’m going to introduce him in a second.

I’m running for reelection to keep jobs in Michigan. We have got a lot of … Last year before the China plague came in, we have the China plague. Thank you China very much. Should have never let that happen. They should have never, ever let it happen. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop it from coming out here and coming into the US, in Europe and the rest of the world, 188 countries. But it is what it is and we’re not happy about it and we’re going to remember it. We’re going to remember it, but we had in Michigan and in the country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, there has never been an economy.

Now, we’re building it again and it’s being built fast. By the way, it’s turning out to be John, a super V. No more V. Now it’s starting out to be a super V, but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, because if we win, America wins and that’s what it’s about. If we win, America wins.

Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs, he wants to eliminate your borders. He’s promised to flood your state with refugees. You know that as well as I do. You see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden’s pledged to have a 700% increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie, a 700% increase in the flow of refugees. So, he wants to lift it up by 700%. This is in their manifesto.

He’s also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. By the way, the wall, it’s over 311 miles long right now doing very well. Doing very well. Make the mic louder, the mic louder.
Biden is waging war against the American middle class. I think most of you are not middle class. You’re upper class. You’re the elite. You know the way they talk about the elite, the elite, they’re really elite. I see them. They’re not elite. You’re the elite. The elite has decided. Boy, have we hurt the elite, haven’t we now? You’re the super elite.
The left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you. It’s very simple. Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, blocked the entry of foreign terrorist, fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good. They are good.
In fact, Biden was interviewed today on … There they are. CNN.
No, he was just interviewed today. He was interviewed by Jake Tapper who I find to be a nice guy. I don’t think he likes me too much, but that’s okay. He was interviewed on CNN and they said, “Which is better, NAFTA or the USMCA?” He said, “No, no, the USMCA.” Tapper goes, “What?” Couldn’t believe it. He said USMCA. He made a mistake. From his perspective, he made a mistake because he doesn’t know what’s going on. Even though he’s right, he doesn’t know. There were a little surprised to hear that. They gave him a few chances.

Let’s ask that question again, but we brought back our manufacturing jobs. We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now, we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before. Before the end of the year, we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the China virus. I have a feeling … By the way, I think the vaccine is going to come very soon, going to come very soon. With it or without it, we’re rounding the turn. You see what’s happening. You see the numbers are plunging. You see how good we’re doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world, but the fake news doesn’t like saying that. They don’t like telling you that.
Next year, unless you have somebody that’s going to quadruple your taxes, raise your taxes, raise up all of those regulations that we cut, next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, and two agendas for the future. There’s never been a vision like this. You have sleepy Joe and you have Trump. Sleepy Joe, he’s a beauty. He’s a beauty. He’s a beauty.

I watched the Democrat debates, right? I watched them up there and he was so bad. I said, “There’s no way he makes it.” It’s sad, isn’t it? The first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes, and she’s a nice person. She meant this really, me, I view it differently. But she looked at, she watched the debate and she watched Joe and she said, “Darling, it’s so sad.” This was early on. This is the guy I’m running against. It’s so sad. Darling, it’s so sad. But we got them.

Joe Biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it’s not him. He doesn’t know what platform. He doesn’t. It’s your radical left people. It’s AOC plus three. It’s all these people. Bernie. It’s Bernie. It’s Kamala, the most liberal person in the US Senate.

I tell it all the time. She started off her poll numbers at 15, 14, 12, 12. Then she went back up to 12 and a half. Then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out. She dropped out, but there’s never been anything like this. No major party has ever had a candidate that’s so extreme in his views. Again, he took the manifesto drawn up by Bernie and the super lips and that’s what he’s going by, including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment.

On November 3rd, Michigan, you better vote for me. I got you so many damn car plants.
I’ll tell you what, I’ll be so angry at you. I got you a lot of plants. Is that right? I mean, have you seen how we’re doing here? All the plants that have been built, are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded? They don’t want to give you credit for that. They just expanded. I went to Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I say, “Prime Minister, you have to start doing something.” He’s a great guy. He’ll be retiring soon. He’s a great guy, the prime minister of Japan, Abe. I say, “Shinzō, Shinzō, you have to do me a favor. You’ve got to send car plants over here. You’re sending all those cars. We stupidly don’t-

You’re sending all those cars. We stupidly don’t charge you tariffs on those cars that pour into our country. I said, “Shinzo, you got to give us plants.” “No, no, no, I can’t do that. That is up to the free enterprise system of Japan.” I say, “Shinzo, you’re a powerful man. You can do it.” “Oh, I can’t do it.” The next day they announced five car companies are coming to Michigan. Right? [ 00:22:28]. Now they’ve been building it for a number of years, but you hadn’t had a plan built in like 42 years. They were the old plants. And it’s been amazing what’s happened in Michigan. But honestly, it’s been amazing what’s happened in Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida and New Hampshire and so many other places. Our country is doing great. We had to take a pause to get rid of the China virus, and we got rid … We’re coming around. We’re coming around that turn. I’m telling you, you watch, next year, better than last year. It’s going to be better than last year.

Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we’ll allow Sleepy Joe to impose $4 trillion in tax hikes, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, shut down the economy, and tell your governor to open up your state. It’s all Democrat governors. And I think they do it for political reasons because there’ll be less activity. You’d be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing. You got to open it up the state.

And also, you have to have a governor because right now Michigan’s lagging. Great football, great coach, great team. We want a governor, John James, that’s going to let Michigan play Big Ten football this year. You’ve been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open Big Ten at my suggestion. How about Sleepy Joe? He said, “Donald Trump is against football.” No, no, no. I’m the one that says open it up, let’s play football. These people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it. They’re liars. I’ll tell you, they lie.

But we have a good chance. You have a very good commissioner, and the commissioner is working hard, and hopefully, very soon they’ll say you’re going to play football. And I hope they’re not leaving Michigan out because it’s never the same if they do. But you have Maryland, where they have a problem in terms of playing. And the governors have a lot of power over that. They have a lot of power, a lot of say. So let’s play Big Ten football, right?

They want to shut down auto production, delay the vaccine. They want to destroy your suburbs. Look at what I’ve done for your suburbs. You know what I’ve done. You know what I’ve done. Does anybody want to have somebody from Antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb? I don’t think so too much. Say, “Darling, who moved in next door?” “Oh, it’s a resident of Antifa.” “No, thank you. Let’s get out of here. Let’s get the hell out of here, darling. Let’s leave our suburbs. I wish Trump were president. He wouldn’t have allowed that to happen.” And that’s exactly right, I won’t allow it to happen.

The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs. I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country. And I got rid of it. They said, “Sir, we can amend it and make it less crazy.” I said, “No, I don’t want to amend it. I don’t want to do that. I want to get rid of it.” “Well, sir, why don’t we just do a simple amendment? It would be” … I said, “I want to get rid of it. End it.” And we ended it. We ended it.

I think the people living in the suburbs … which I know very well. I watched Westchester in New York where they were doing things that should never have been done, and it’s not going to happen to our suburbs. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. For the last four years, they’ve tried everything to stop us, and they are only getting more desperate by the day.
Can you imagine if on September 3rd, they say, “Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been declared the winner. Donald Trump has been declared” … At first, they’ll go crazy. And then they’ll say, “Okay, it’s time now to be reasonable.” They will have had it. They will have had it. We were coming together as a nation. Very interesting. Before the plague came in from China, we will coming together. It was success. Somebody said, “What’s going to bring you together?” And it was. We were coming together. I was starting to get calls from Democrats that … Frankly, we didn’t speak much. And I was starting to get calls, and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in, and we saw what was happening, and it really stopped things.

But success was getting very, very close to bringing us all together. And then we had to say, “Let’s take a time out. We got to fix this mess.” And we did, and now we’re coming back strong, but success brings us together, and it was happening, and then we got that terrible situation happened, and we’ll never forget it.

Biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding Americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through, in all cases, Democrat-run cities. Republican-run cities are doing very well. I hope you know that. And I hope you know, like in Minneapolis, we were asked to come in, we went in, we took care of that problem in about, what, 30 minutes? Unfortunately, they let almost two weeks go by. And if you look at what we just did in Wisconsin, which was so amazing, three days, and we went in. And by the way, the US Marshals went in to get the killer, and that was the end of that. They got the killer, they got the killer. You know what I’m talking about.
 
And we were going to go into Seattle. The next day, we’re all set, all lined up, looking forward to it. We just said, “We’re doing it.” I mean, they actually took over a part of the city, and the mayor said, “This is going to be a summer of love,” right? Where do these people come from? But we were all set to go in there, heard we were going in, we informed them we’re going in, and they sent their police to do it, and we never even had to go in. But we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes.

We love you. We love you.

Thank you.
We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.

Don’t say that, I’ll start to cry, and that wouldn’t be good for my image. You don’t want to see me cry. I’ll start to cry. One of the fake news broadcasters, because this happened the other day, we had a tremendous crowd like this. I mean, we had a tremendous crowd in North Carolina. They started chanting, “We love you. We love you. We love you.” And it’s incredible, they said with all the years that they’ve been covering presidential elections, they’ve never heard that chant that, “We love you.” No, it’s very nice. No, they’ve never heard it. True.
We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.

Now they’ll say, “He misrepresented. 18 years ago, there was a rally held by somebody, and we heard the words from two people that, ‘We love you, sir.'” Now this is what we’re dealing with. And by the way, I look out, there’s a lot of people that … Look at this. There’s people back there that can’t even get in. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you. It’s really nice to be with you. As president, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement. I was very honored to receive the endorsement of the Police Officers Association of Michigan. Where are they? Where are they? They’re here someplace. Where are they? Thank you, fellows. That’s really nice. I’ll tell you. That’s an honor. I have to be honest. I got it from Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South … But Michigan is Michigan. Thank you.

I don’t think there’s any law enforcement officer that is against us. What is our poll number? 99. I know they had 365,000 at one group, and they got a unanimous vote. I said, “That’s pretty good”. How can you go the other way? You people are fantastic, and we love you. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Biden says he wants to protect Black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young African American citizens. Thousands. The murder rate in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, Baltimore, New York, so many others is higher than in Afghanistan, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. You will have crime like you’ve never seen before. You’ll have crime like you’ve never seen.

Last week, Joe Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, criminals, and violent extremists without charge. Biden’s plan … And every time I say Biden’s plan, it’s not his plan, it’s the people that tell them what they’re going to do, so please understand. I just don’t want to say that every time I mention his name. So it should say, “The people that control Biden’s plan” is to appease domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them, to lock them up. If Joe Biden is elected, far left lunatics won’t just be running failed Democrat city, they’ll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Supreme Court, and we can’t let that happen. No city, town, or suburb will be safe. On November 3rd, your vote will save America. Remember, it’s the most important election we’ve ever had.

I’m joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in Washington with the fake impeachment, the impeachment hoax, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. Somebody said Russia’s coming up again. Adam Schiff said, “We’d like to find out about” … I said, “What about China? What about other countries?” It’s always Russia. Russia, Russia. They’re at it again. I want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us. They love your state, and they love our country. Congressman Jack Bergman. Great job, Jack. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. Great. Great going, John. He’s a tough cookie. And Tim Walberg. Tim, thank you. Great job. What great people.
 
And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night. He’s a star. He’s going to be a future star. We have a very much different party than we had four years ago. We’re now the party of the workers. We’re the party of a lot of different things now, but we weren’t really considered the party of the workers. Certainly not anymore. Remember this, we’re the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Honestly. Remember when they used to say, “he doesn’t act presidential”? And I used to say, “It’s so easy to be presidential.” I’d only have about 10 or 15 people here. You’d be bored. But remember I used to do that? But I’d always say, “I can be more presidential than any president in our history, except for the possibility of Abraham Lincoln when he wears his hat.” Tough to beat. That’s tough to beat, John James.

But seriously, if you want to be well-represented … Your current Senator, I don’t even know this guy. I don’t even know this guy. Nobody does. They don’t know who he is. They don’t even know. He comes into the office, I say, “Who is that guy?” I know every Senator. Democrat, Republican. I don’t know this guy. I know your other Senator. I can tell by her hair. She’s got interesting hair. But that was John’s first crack. He learned a lot. And frankly, and I mean this, if he had more support from the Republican Party, he would’ve won that race. He would’ve.

But this guy Peters, right? Peters. I say, “Who’s Peters?” Nobody knows him. He doesn’t do anything. I mean, look, we’re going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great. He loves our country. He’s been educated at the highest level. He was always the top at everything he’s ever done. And this is what he has.

And I’ll be honest with you, John. I think I can tell this story. John and I were thinking about John. I was thinking about John more than myself because I know talent. And I said, “John, you can run for a certain House seat, right? And you’re guaranteed to win. You can run for another House seat. It’ll be a tough race, but you’re going to win. Or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of. It’s like a habit that they press that particular trigger, but that’s a tough race. So you can be an absolute Congressman, or you can take a shot at this one.” He said, “Sir, I can do more in the Senate than I can do in the House.” And that was his decision. Right? Took a lot of guts.

So John, I’m with you. You have my total and complete endorsement. You have everything I can do. Everything I can do, we will do for you. And I really believe you’re going to make it. You’re running against somebody that is just ridiculous, folks. It’s ridiculous. Don’t do it.

Also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job, helping our Congressman. Paul Junge. Where’s Paul Junge? Paul, thank you. Good luck. I heard you’re doing well, Paul. Paul Junge. Lisa McClain. Lisa? Great job. It’s going well. And Eric Essahki. Thank you, Eric. Good luck. Good luck. We’re going to be out here helping you, too. We’re going to be out here. I hope John doesn’t even need help, but we’re going to help John, too. We’re going to help all of you. All right? We’re going to be doing it. Thank you.

Also with you is RNC Chairwoman. She was the head of the whole state, and she kept calling me back, back. “Sir, one more speech, you’re going to win Michigan.” Hadn’t been won in decades. “One more speech, sir, you’re going to win Michigan.” I said, “All right. Ron, I’m coming in one more time, but that’s it.” I said, “That woman is the most aggressive person I’ve ever met.” She said, “I’m telling you, sir, one more speech.” I said, “All right, I’ll do it one more time, but that’s it.” About a day after I got back, I said, “I just got back from Michigan. It was wonderful.” I get a call from Ronna McDaniel, and she goes, “Sir, could you come in tomorrow for another speech?”

Well, whatever happens, she is the one that got me here at midnight on … She is. So when it came time to picking the head of the RNC, as president, you have a couple of things to say about it, right? I said, “Who’s that woman that kept getting me back to Michigan? Boy oh boy, she’ll be great.” Ronna McDaniel.

And somebody’s doing a fantastic job and tells us we’re really pretty far ahead. Maybe way ahead. They had a poll. I think it was a Gallup poll. They said 62% of the people are lying about their poll. Now, they’re only lying having to do with my … And I don’t know if I’m supposed to be insulted by that or not, but we’ll take it. But we could have a very big win. And look, no president has done for Michigan what President Trump has done for Michigan. And you’re going to remember that. And I’m going to remember Michigan.

Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox. Great. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Laura.

We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. 47 years of bad votes. After the last administration nearly killed the US auto industry, I saved the US auto industry. Joe Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for American auto jobs. I withdrew from the TPP my first week in office. That was so easy. That was so easy. You wouldn’t have been making cars. You would’ve been buying cars from foreign lands. We have enough of that.

Biden supported the horrendous South Korea deal that would’ve wiped out US production of the pickup truck, which is the most … The pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes. You know why? We have something called the Chicken Tax. Does anyone know what I’m talking about? The Chicken Tax. It’s a tariff of 25%, and it keeps other countries out of here, and it expired, and South Korea didn’t want to do it, but they did it. We got it right back, and we put it on for a long time, and now you’re making … But remember this, go check it out. The Chicken Tax. I’ll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that. Maybe you don’t want to know about it.

But we’re keeping those small trucks, and we’re keeping our whole industry good. And we’re expanding our autos now, our cars, and we’re doing a great job of it, and I want to thank everybody. Doing a great job.

And by the way, many other things in Michigan. Biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry, and I reversed that rule. I actually reversed it, and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car. The United States lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the Obama-Biden disaster. Before the virus, my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants. How about 200? I didn’t know that. 200. 200. I thought it was a little less than that. Wait, I want to see that again. 200. It’s …

… than that. Wait, I want to see that again, 200. It says 200. Do you believable it? That’s a lot.

You know, I have a choice between teleprompter and freelance. I hate to say, the freelance is always a hell of a lot better, but …

If you remember, and you remember well, I actually got elected because of freelance. We didn’t have teleprompters. There were no teleprompters. But think of that, 200, we’re talking about 200 plants. I thought it was a much lower number. I thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number. At 200, you have no choice.

Yesterday, Biden was in Michigan. He said, “I better get out of the basement.” This guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals. Biden championed NAFTA, perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country. He continued to embrace and promote NAFTA for decades. I told you, he just said it was not as good as the deal I made. I can’t believe, oh they’re giving him hell tonight. They’re giving him hell. What did you say that for? Boy oh boy. Yeah, hiding. ‘Joe Hiden.’ Look, this doesn’t sound nice. I’ll say it, and they’ll criticize for it, you watch. But I have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics. I really believe that. I do. Can you imagine if I lost to him? I’d have to say I lost to the worst candidate ever put up. Don’t do that to me, Michigan. Don’t do that.

Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which, by the way, was a disaster. China was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this World Trade Organization with all sorts of advantages. Just a terrible, terrible situation took place. That’s when China became a big, powerful economic power.

But, if you look at the numbers just before the plague, now, the numbers are different, we were going up, up, up, we were beating them like a drum. They weren’t even close. We were gaining, gaining, gaining. We were number one by far. You know, for years I’ve heard that in 2019, China was going to surpass us. Well, in 2019, we gained a lot on them. We were doing great. We were doing great and we’ll be doing even better next year, you watch.

Yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden’s son, where’s Hunter? See his first name, I now name … His first name is where. Where’s Hunter? He must be a brilliant guy because with no experience he’s taken more money from more countries. He had no job and then he became rich. But where’s Hunter who facilitated the sale of a Michigan automotive company to a leading Chinese military defense contractor? Does anyone know that China’s military got yet another piece of American manufacturing, Mike and the Biden family made a lot of money on it. It was a lot of money.
 
What about Ukraine? He got $183,000 a month, $3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy, working for an energy company, by the way. What’s your experience, Hunter? What’s your experience with energy? “I don’t have any.” “Okay. We’ll pay you 183,000 a month and I will give you an upfront payment, Hunter, of $3 million. Will that be satisfactory?” He goes, “Yes. I’ll take it.”

Would anybody here not take that deal? Anybody? Please raise your head. This is one guy, right, you must be a pretty rich guy. If Biden’s elected, China will own America. Washington vultures like Biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state. Michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that Biden supported.
 
By the way, I don’t know if anybody … But does anybody remember like 12 years ago? Long before I thought about running for president, when I enjoyed my life, I had the greatest life. “Where would we like to go? Let’s go to Monte-Carlo this weekend. Let’s go.” No, I had a great life, but I was honored. I was doing very well. I was honored in Michigan. Does anybody know that? I was given man of the year award by somebody?

I came in and I spent like 45 minutes talking about how you’ve been ripped off, how all your auto companies are leaving and going to Mexico and, by the way, to Canada too. But how they’re all leaving and going to Mexico and Canada. I spent the whole time talking about it. At the end I felt embarrassed, I said, “I hope I haven’t insulted the state too much, but why do you let this happen?” I stopped it. I stopped.

It won’t be happening. It won’t be happening. It’s not going to happen anymore. Biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year, I kept my promise to Michigan workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end, and when we signed that brand new US- Mexico-Canada agreement into law.

The USMCA includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan. Now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave Michigan, fire all of our workers, go to Mexico or Canada, make the car or the product, send it in here without tariffs. We end up with closed factories, no job and no taxes. That’s not happening anymore. That’s not happening anymore.

But do you remember how bad it was just before I took office? It was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Michigan jobs. Biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. Just so you know, China’s paying us tens of billions of dollars a month. Before me, China never paid anything. They didn’t pay us 25 cents. You know what I did with some of that money? I gave it to our farmers. I don’t know if we have a lot, do we have farmers here? We have farmers. Raise your hands farmers. That’s not bad

No, I gave $28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were targeted. They said, “You know …” and that’s what they did in the past to other presidents. They said, “If you do this, we’re going to stop doing business with your farmers and you’re not going to be able to get any votes and you’re going to lose the Midwest and all of that.” I said, “You know what? I do, whatever you want.”

Then I went to Sonny Perdue, Secretary Of Agriculture, a great guy, I said, Sonny, “How much are they being targeted for?” “Sir, $12 billion the first year, two years, three years ago, and then 16 billion, a total of 28 billion.” I said, “That’s okay. We’re putting tariffs on everything they send into our country, 25%.” Was going to raise it to 50%. Also, 10% at 12%, all different tariffs. We took in billions and billions, and I said, “You know what we’re going to do? We’re going to take, of that, the 12 and the 16, $28 billion and we’re going to give it to our farmers who were targeted,” and our farmers are doing great. That’s what we did. Do you think Joe Biden would do that? He wouldn’t have a clue. Hillary wouldn’t have had a clue. Crazy Bernie wouldn’t have, nobody would add a clue on that one. By the way, we had tens of billions of dollars left over. You know what I did with that? We gave it to the US Treasury, right smack into the heart of the US Treasury.

And we’re still getting those big tariffs. Even though we made a trade deal with China. I said, “No, you got to leave the tariffs on.” A lot of people didn’t know it. Schumer went, “Well, I don’t like to do …” First of all, he didn’t like tariffs, and then all of a sudden he loves it. But when I made the deal with China, I left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts. When I left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it.

I said to Schumer, “What do you think of the deal?” “I don’t like it because you got rid of the tariffs.” I said, “No, we left the tariffs on.” This is what it is. No matter how you do it, no matter how good the deal, they’ll say, “It’s no good,” because they don’t love the country. They don’t love the country. Remember that. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. That’s a nice plane. Somebody said to me, “Your plane’s just as nice as that.” I said, “No, it’s not. That’s Air Force One. That’s the nicest.” Always, that’s the nicest.

I also authorize millions of dollars to save Michigan Soo Locks, and forget all the problems they had. For years and years, they fought over the money to do it. We got $300 million to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and we have done a job on the Soo Locks. They were rotting you. Weren’t going to have anything come through the Soo Locks. It’s all done. That deal is all done. It’s all done. Right? Thank you. Thank you. Where are my guys there? Good job. Right. Even though you’re law enforcement, that’s a good job, right?

Two months ago, I also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the Edenville dam. Where are the people from Edenville? Yeah, good. No, that was a terrible thing and they’re working very hard right now. We’re providing more than $43 million in federal funds to help homeowners, businesses and communities in central Michigan to recover from that catastrophe.

And you know, it’s a privately owned dam. I think we’re going to have to sue the ass off of the company that has it, I don’t know. No, I don’t know why we’re doing it. I’ll tell you why we’re doing it, our great Congressman. Thank you, Congressman. Great job. Thank you. He called up. He said, “Sir, we have to do it. It’s a private dam.” I said, “Well, if it’s a private dam, don’t they have to do it?” Say, “It will never happen.” Right? But we’ll end up getting some of that back, I think. Great, great representative you have. I want to tell you, [ 00:56:47]. Thank you.

Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. We’ve ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported over 20,000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. As I said, we’ve already built over 310 miles of border wall. It’s all going to be finished very quickly. We’re averaging about 10 new, brand new, beautiful miles every single week. It’ll be finished very short.

We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. All made in the USA, by the way. All made in the USA. You know, with the fake news today, I said, “And we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech. We have systems that you’ve never even seen before. President Xi has nothing like it. Putin has nothing like it. Nobody has anything like what we have.” They said, “Is he giving away military information?” No, I’m saying, “We have the greatest weapons in the world.” That’s what I’m saying. They said, “He may be giving away classified information.” You don’t have to worry about it. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology because you’re giving away classified information. Now, I just want to let people know, we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. There’s nobody like the US military. We have the most powerful military in the world. When I took it over, it was depleted. It was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous, endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years, and you know, those soldiers are starting to come home very big. You know that right?

They’re all coming home and we launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years since the Air Force, we launched the Space Force, very, very, [ 00:59:32]. We passed the MISSION Act, we call it VA Choice and VA Accountability. We hold people accountable if they don’t treat our vets good, you’re fired. Get out. You’re fine.

We did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That’s true. We did more. That sort of has a nice ring to it. Right? Think of it. We did more and it’s true. Just take a look, Space Force, by itself, that would be a major achievement, and with us, we did so many things, so many things. But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true.

A lot of what I did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did, including regulations all over the place. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We paid $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. We ought to speak to law enforcement about that. How do we send 1.8 billion in cash? In cash? You guys ought to take a look at that please.

I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it, for decades and decades, they all said. I tell this story, it was a hard thing to get done. It was easy to talk about in the campaign, “We’re going to open up the embassy in Jerusalem. We’re going to make it. It becomes automatically the capital of Israel.” Everybody said it for very, very many decades, for decades, many presidents.

But I realize now why it was an effort because as soon as I got in, I was lobbied by everybody, “Please don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t make the capital of Israel Jerusalem. Don’t move your embassy.” So went on and on. Then I said, “Let’s do it anyway.” It’s true. And the word got out. The word got out that I was going to do it, and I was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every … Everybody was calling me, “Please sir, don’t do it. Please.”

So I did what we sometimes will do in business, I told them … When a king calls, when somebody calls, an Emir, when somebody calls, tell them, “I’ll call them back in a few days. I’m sorry, sir. He won’t be able to speak right now, he’ll call you back on Wednesday. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.” On Tuesday, I announced that I’m doing it. Then I got on the phone with 18 different companies. I go, “Hey, how you doing? You called, I’m just returning your call.” “Oh, it’s too late, sir. We called about Israel. It’s too late.” I said, “Gee, I’m sorry. I wish you got to me a little bit sooner.” I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades. And by the way, on Wednesday, I believe of next week, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you know, the country, a very powerful, very respected country with a great leader, the UAE, is coming to the White House and we’re going to sign an agreement that hasn’t been signed in many decades. It’s peace and its recognition of Israel and all of the things, nobody thought it could be done.

It’s an amazing thing. I don’t say this out of ego, but I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now, I have to tell you, that’s sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn’t cover it. Could you imagine? When Obama came to office, they said, “We’re going to give him the Nobel Peace Prize.” He actually said, “What did I do? I didn’t do anything.” He didn’t do anything for eight years, frankly. But he said, “What did I do?” They gave it to them in a matter of weeks, right? Weeks.

With us, we’ve done so much. We have done so much on so many different fronts. Remember North Korea? Remember? They were going to be at war with North Korea. Where’s the war? Where’s the war? Where’s the war? And we have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. Who knows what happens? All I know is, we’re not in war and that’s okay. They said, “But he gave away so much.”

I said, “I gave away nothing.” “No, he gave away so much.” When I said, “What did they give away?” You know what they said? “Uh, we don’t know.” I said, “Here’s what I gave away, I gave away nothing.” They said, “Oh, but you agreed to meet.” Oh, I see. I agreed to meet. So now they’re saying, “I agreed to meet, it was such a big deal.”

Instead of being in a war, I think agreeing to meet is okay, right? And we did. He’s a different kind of a guy and he’s a smart guy, a very smart guy. We get along. Getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing. We’re trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years. These fools. These fools. You know, you got nuclear weapons, you got big armies, big navies, “He gets along with Putin. That’s a terrible thing.” No, it’s a good thing. If I get along, that’s good. He likes me. I like him. Not so bad. “He gets along with Kim Jong-un.”

… Not so bad. He gets along with Kim Jong-Un. That’s a terrible thing. No, it’s a good thing. I’m trying to convince him. It’s okay. It’s okay not to go to war. It’s really okay. He gets along with President Xi, he gets along with Prime Minister Abe. He gets along with a lot of people, and it’s okay. That’s a good thing. It’s really hard. These stupid people that have been running this operation for 30, 40 years, and they come out against me, and all they did was stick us in these endless wars. We’re fighting for sand and blood. Sand and blood. Syria, what do you get out of it? You get sand, you get blood, you get injuries, you get death. These people don’t know what the hell they’re doing and it’s one of the reasons I got elected, I can tell you that. We don’t like his foreign policy. And this is said by one of the guy’s that got us into the war in Iraq, got us into the Middle East. So, it’s … We’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job for you. We’re doing a great job for Michigan. Just to finish in the Middle East, we killed the founder and leader of Isis, Al-Baghdadi. And by the way, we’re pulling back and we’re doing everything so beautifully. If we do get into war, we win the war. We don’t fight for nothing. We fought for nothing. We don’t ever want to have war but if there is a war, nobody’s going to even come close to being able to beat us. And we won’t be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe. You people know that a lot better than the idiots in Washington that has represented us for 35 years.

We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani is dead. We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home, and they’re coming home very rapidly. You see that. Sleepy Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War. He supported the Defense Sequester that gutted our military, destroyed our military, set us back so many years. I got rid of it immediately. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He was against it. Everything he did, he was wrong on as said by Gates, you know? Secretary of Defense, Secretary of everything. He was sort of like … He had more jobs than any human being I’ve ever seen. But he said, “Everything, everything that Biden was for was wrong.” He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of Isis. He was unable to do anything with Isis.

I had the leader of a very important country in my office recently, and he said, and I’ll probably refer the press, they’ll say, “Who is it?” He said, “Thank you, sir. You were the one that got rid of Isis.” I said, “I was the one? You’re actually giving me credit?” He said, “Absolutely. When you took over, Isis in Iraq and Isis in Syria was all over. It was growing at a level like we’ve never seen. You came in, and you absolutely wiped it out.” Happens to be … The man that said that happens to be the leader of Iraq, and he was very nice. He was very generous [ 01:09:54] as he came to the White House two weeks ago. And we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we’ve had but he really oversaw the rise of China as a positive development. Remember, he said, “No, it’s a positive development for America and for the world.”

He’s been in Washington for 47 years now. He’s all of a sudden going to change? He’s going to change? He’s not going to change. Don’t forget, he was in Washington in his primetime, which was never considered great, and now it’s no longer primetime. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died from the China plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on the altar of open borders. And now Joe Biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, putting millions of lives around the world at risk. And the only reason he’s doing that is he knows we’re right next to having a vaccine. So, he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn’t want us to get credit.

But again, it’s not him, it’s the people surrounding him. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Recently, I visited the workers at Ford’s historic [ 01:11:27] plant, who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators, after we invoked the Defense Production Act, and they’ve done a fantastic job. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country. They needed a ventilator, we had nothing. We were left, bare cupboards. I always say the cupboards were bare. We’re delivering lifesaving therapies, and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world.

Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the United States. You don’t hear that from the fake news. Hey, America will prevail over the China virus, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” That’s it. We’re doing very well. As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, “Keep calm and carry on.” That’s what I did. This whack job that wrote the book, he said, “Well, Trump knew a little bit.” They wanted me to come out and scream, “People are dying, we’re dying.” No, no, we did it just the right way. We have to be calm. We don’t want to be crazed lunatics. We have to lead.

When Hitler was bombing, I don’t know if you know this, when Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak, and he always spoke with calmness. He said, “We have to show calmness.” No, we did it the right way and we’ve done a job like nobody. All of those great generals, all of those great admirals, our great vice president, Mike Pence, they did a fantastic job. Our doctors, and they don’t get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to November 3rd, but we’ve done a fantastic job. I think we’ve probably done the best job of any country, certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic.

Through our historic relief programs, we’ve saved more than 1.6 million Michigan jobs, and over 128,000 Michigan businesses. Michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost, and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn’t have a clue. She’s like Joe. You would have regained far more than that. Open up your state, Madam Governor, open up your state. Let’s go. Just like crazy Nancy Pelosi, your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules. Her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on Memorial Day weekend while she was ordering the people of Michigan to stay in their homes, and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right.

The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we’re having right now. He would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry. You know, on regulations, it took, in many cases, 18, 19, 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved. We have it down now to two years. We’re trying to get it down to one year, and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons, but we’re going to know about it very fast. No more 20 year approvals or disapprovals.

He wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens. He will destroy your social security. He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save social security. Remember they said last time? “Oh, Trump is going to destroy social security.” Well, it’s now four years, we haven’t touched it. We’ve protected it, and that’s going to remain that way. Biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he’s elected, charter schools, so important, are gone. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans, instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we have been through, we are changing Washington.

And in conclusion, although I hate, I really do, I hate to conclude, I hate to conclude because I love being with you, I do. I do. So, in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ve been doing it [ 01:17:41]. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in Michigan. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity, and that’s already happening.

We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities, and we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. And you’re lucky I’m here because you’re Second Amendment would be gone if I wasn’t. And they didn’t touch it.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out people, keep them out of these horrible, horrible situations where they hurt our country, they hurt the people of our country, and we’re also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense. We’ve already got it, pretty much. And we will maintain peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and it’s all signed and it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure I win. Can you imagine? This is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is. You’ll figure it out. Price transparency. Did they fight me on that one. January 1st. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you’ve never seen before. I’ve already signed it. Favored Nations. The drug companies are not happy, I will tell you.

Just, all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they’re running against me. Favored Nations, where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world, we pay that number. We will protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect our patients. We will always our people. We will your pre-existing conditions, as I said. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will restore patriotic education, you know what I mean by that, and we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust.

And I don’t know if you saw it, but during the Democrat National Convention and Caucus, they took twice, I thought I was sort of, maybe they made a mistake, you saw that, they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. And then they said, “Oh, well maybe it was a mistake.” It wasn’t a mistake. That’s where they’re coming from. Don’t be foolish. That’s where they’re coming from and there’s nothing that Sleepy Joe Biden can do about it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Michigan.

So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote. So important. From Grand Rapids to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to Mackinac, and from Flint to right here in Freeland, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. It’s the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg revolutionized entire industries. Michigan, well, you know this one, right? Michigan gave us Motown, right? That’s right. That’s right, Motown. We love Motown. Michigan gave us Motown, gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and the unrivaled might of the American Midwest. This is the state where tough, strong and determined workers made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater and greater every single day.

Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we will be taking back our country, we’ll be taking it back from people that don’t love our country and that take back is almost complete. We have to win on November 3rd. We’re returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we are going to keep on winning. Vote for John James. John James. We need John James.

We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. We love you, Michigan. Thank you. Thank you.",10/9/20
"
Well, I thank you very much. So I want to start by saying, “Hello, Nevada. How are you doing? How are you?” And I’m thrilled to be in Douglas County, but people are coming from all over the place. There’s a lot of people for Douglas County, isn’t it? We have thousands and thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, that’s what we have. And 52 days from now, we’re going to win Nevada, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that we’ll negotiate, right? ‘Cause we’re probably, based on the way we were treated, we’re probably entitled to another four after that.

And it should never happen to another President. That’s just a dishonest group of people. But here we are, and we’re going to be here for another four years. The governor of your state-
… tried very hard to stop us from having this event tonight. He didn’t like us having… They can have riots and they can have all sorts of things and that’s okay, you can burn up the house, that’s okay. We call this a protest because if you call it a protest, you’re allowed to have it. It’s okay. So if anybody asks you outside, this is called a friendly protest, okay? It’s true. You can’t have political rallies. That’s because of me, because if Biden were here, he’d have about three people. Do you ever see him with his little circles? The circle? You know why he puts the circles? Because he wants to be like correct with COVID, but it’s not really because they can’t get anybody to fill up a room. So they put these big circles. So he can’t get anybody to fill. Nobody wants to go. Oh, boy, the fake news, look at all those people back there, the fakers.
That’s true. Boy, they covered. Did you see the other day, now they’re finding out that to do an interview, an interview, they ask him a question. That means they’re giving him the questions, they never gave me questions before. So to do an interview, he demands on getting the questions, and his people write out the answer. So they ask him a question. He goes, “Bring it up closer, I can’t see it, dammit.” Great. This is something. You know, we have a debate coming up in three weeks. And here’s the problem. Winston Churchill. Did you ever hear of Winston Churchill? Winston Churchill was a great debater. Great. And if Joe gets off the stage, walks off the stage, if he makes it, which I think he probably will, in all fairness, he’s been doing this for 47 years, right? I think he probably will. If he gets off the stage, they’re going to say it was the single greatest debate they’ve ever seen. Winston Churchill was nothing compared to Sleepy Joe.

You know that, you know that, they’re going to say, “What a great performance. He was great today. He was great. This guy was great.” Nah, he’s not great. But your governor tried to stop us. He tried to stop us. The governor of Nevada, he tried to stop us, and we went to different venues. Kelly O’Donnell, she’s a fading reporter for NBC. Do you know that? She was on, she said, “Well, they have a crowd tonight.” Behind her, it looked like 25,000 people. That’s what we have, by the way, a lot more coming in. But she said, “He’s got maybe a thousand people, a thousand.” You know what I got? I have a thousand people here. No, this is the fake news. You know what? It’s not a question of how many… They are just a bunch of dishonest people, I’ve never seen anything like it.
Being in real estate and being in New York and being in all over, I’ve seen a lot of dishonest people. I think the media, the fake news is the most dishonest group of people I’ve ever seen anywhere in my entire life. And that includes, by the way, leaders of foreign countries that aren’t our friends, okay? That’s a big statement. They really are bad news. But here we are, and this is really amazing. The governor tried to stop us, he couldn’t, but think of this, he’s in control of millions of votes. Here’s a guy calling venues, telling them not to have the rally, calling different venues, “Don’t have the rally. We’re not going to let you have the rally.”

And he’s calling, this governor who was a political hack, he was a political hack, and then he became governor. And this is the guy that we’re entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions. And then we’re supposed to win these states, and we have a guy that would do that where he won’t let us have, and we call it a protest and therefore we can do it. But you want to know something? It’s a disgrace. So who the hell is going to trust? They say, “Trust government.” Well, how would you trust a guy that fought that we aren’t here, that we can’t have all these thousands of people? Boy, you are really back far. That’s… Look at that.

No, but seriously. And now he’s in charge of the election and the millions of ballots. So if I’m up like millions of votes, he can rig the election, he can rig the election. And I’ll tell you what, whether it’s in North Carolina, whether it’s in Michigan, whether it’s in other states where they’re sending out, they’re going to be sending out 80 million ballots. And it’s Democrats. They’re trying to rig this election, at every single place in the last year, year and a half, go modern day, forget about… Tiny amounts, a congressional race in New York, a small number of votes. If you go to New Jersey, if you go to Virginia, if you go to Pennsylvania, if you go to California, look at some of these races, every one of these races was a fraud, missing ballots. And I don’t mean like 1%. I mean like 20%, 25%, they’re trying to rig the election.

They should make people, if you register, if you want a solicited ballot, that’s where you ask for it. You have to sign papers. You get it because you can’t be there. That’s one thing. When they send 80 million ballots to people, they have no idea where they’re going. Actually, they probably do have a good idea where they’re going, and that’s our problem. They send 80 million ballots out. Where are they going? Who are they sending them to? Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas? Are they sending them to Democrat areas? These are all controlled by Democrat governors, like your politically motivated governor. So, just to finish on that, look, just to finish on that, he’s a guy that tried to silence us by not having this. And it ended up, our crowd turned out to be a lot bigger than NBC, which is owned by Concast. C-O-N, Concast. C-O-N-C-A-S-T, Concast. It’s really Comcast, but I call it con because it’s a whole con.

I’ll tell you what, in the old days, I think it should still be, news when they broadcast had to be reasonably accurate, right? And they had licensing. Today, they can do whatever the hell they want. It’s fake news, and it’s a disgrace. And you know what, back there, and I’ll tell you, it’s hurting our country. It’s hurting our country. They’re the biggest problem that this country has is the fake news media, worse than the Democrats, because the Democrats are their partners. They play together. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years selling out America, offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military and sacrificing your children’s future in China. I’ve spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military and standing up to China like never before. Nobody has ever stood up to China like we have stood up to China, and you haven’t seen the last of it.
Sleepy Joe Biden, who surrendered, you know where he is now, he’s in his damn basement again. No, he’s in his basement. He’s in his basement. But I can be bad to him because he put the most vicious ad on television that I’ve ever seen. Do you know what I’m talking about? Where I’m standing over the graves of our fallen warriors, our fallen heroes. These are great people, the greatest people there are, and I’m standing over there and they have some sleazebag reporter from a third rate magazine having some source quoting me saying, I won’t even use the term, but saying bad things. And there’s nobody that loves our military, respects it and the people more than me. And they took… And I didn’t even ask. We had 25 people that were witnesses that are on the record already that have said that never took place. It never took place, what they said. And yet pathetic Joe, and he’s a pathetic human being to allow that to happen. Here’s the problem, he doesn’t even know what happened, I don’t think. I think he has no idea, but he’s a pathetic human being to let that happen, where they put an ad like that, where I’m standing over graves. And then they said, “He said this,” with no sources, no nothing. They got nothing. And I have 25 real witnesses with the names, with everything, saying it never happened. And they put an ad like that up, they’re a disgrace. But you know the good part? Now I can be really vicious. I can be really vicious.

And we’ll start by saying, we’re going to start by saying that the Democrats are trying to rig this election because it’s the only way they’re going to win. The only way they’re going to win is to rig it. Biden’s surrendered your jobs to China. Look, his son walked away with a billion and a half dollars, give me a break, give me a… His son’s going to say, “Dad, you can’t take this money away. Don’t do it, Dad, please, I don’t…” You know how much experience he had? There’s a young man here, he’s a very young, young man, handsome young guy. He’s about like 12. You know what? He’s got more experience than Hunter. Hunter.

Where’s Hunter? Where is he? With no experience, no knowledge of energy, no job, got thrown out of the military… You know he got thrown out, by the way. I used to be nice about that. Now I don’t. Once I saw that ad, I don’t have to be nice anymore. Okay, I really mean it. And by the way, on that ad, I know some horrible people, horrible human beings, some of the worst people in the world, I really do, they’re horrible, none of those people, and they’re the worst, the worst, real estate developers in New York, you don’t get much worse. I know some of the worst people in the world, not one person do I know that would say that, standing on top of graves, of heroes, really, not one person. So I will tell you this, so now we can play it like it is. Let’s face it, Joe is shot. Let’s face it, okay? He’s shot. So not that he has anything to do because he won’t know what’s happening. He’ll just be locked up in a room someplace, and the radical left is going to be running our country.

Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years!

Thank you. But now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob. You know that. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. You see what’s going on with all these democratic or I always say Democrat-run cities and states. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster. And we keep saying, “Let us bring in the troops.” Well, we did it in Minneapolis, we ended it. In 45 minutes, it was ended. They went through two weeks. By the way, we could do it in Portland in half an hour. It would all be over. But we have these stupid people that think… How about that poor mayor? Is that pathetic, Wheeler, is that pathetic? They forced him out of his home. He’s now finding a new home, it’s so nice. It’s pathetic. Honestly, it’s pathetic.

We could solve that problem in a half an hour, just like we did. And by the way, the US Marshals did a great job in Portland. They did a great job. You know what I mean. If Biden wins, the rioters win, the anarchists win, arsonists, flag burners, they all win. I’m running for reelection to bring prosperity to Nevada, to the whole country. I’ve been here a long time. I have some things in Nevada that are very good to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China. I do get a kick out of watching a guy, “Oh, I’m going to do this.” He copied my whole plan. You see, he says, “Buy America,” I said, “Where the hell have you been for the last half century?”
Thank you.

Could I ask the fake news to take your cameras and show all the way back there for hundreds of yards, all the way back there. Take your cameras. Go as far as the eye can see. No, no, tell NBC News it’s not a thousand people. You can’t see it. You can’t see it down here. You won’t believe how many people. That thing goes back…
So the bottom line is when we win, America wins, that’s what’s happening. And nobody’s done to China what I did. Look, billions, tens of billions of dollars of tariffs we took in. I gave $28 billion to farmers. The farmers are doing very well. They’re doing very well. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. 28 billion. 16 billion one year 12 billion. They were targeted. I said, “How much is it?” Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, said, “How much were they hurt by?” “Sir, 12 billion two years ago and 16 billion last year.” I said, “All right, good. We’ll take it out of China.” We gave them 28 billion, to the farmers. That never happened before. You think Joe Biden would even think about it? He wouldn’t even think about it. He wouldn’t even think about it. No, he’s more worried about, does he have a teleprompter to answer a reporter’s question.

The worst part about that isn’t the fact that he’s doing that, because let’s face it, he’s unable, okay? It’s not that, it’s that the fake news would give him the questions. They never gave me the questions. Did you ever give me questions, back there? Did you ever give me… They don’t give me questions. The fake news would give him questions, but of course now Donna Brazile works for Fox, so that’s gone a long way. Remember? Remember when Donna Brazile gave crooked Hillary the questions, right? To a debate? And then she said, “Well, I don’t think I did it. I don’t remember.” I knew she was in trouble when she said, “I don’t remember doing that. I don’t remember.” She didn’t remember. Oh, okay. Well, as long as you don’t remember.
It’s true. It’s true too. It’s true.

Lock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.

You know what, I used to stand back and I’d say, “Be quiet, please. Don’t say that. It’s really not nice.” You know it’s true. She deleted 33… Think of it. They’ll never find the emails because they were acid washed, deleted. But you know what? She got a subpoena from the United States Congress, right? And she and her lawyer deleted 33,000 emails after she got a United States subpoena. And you say, “Why isn’t she guilty of a major crime?” Right? And then she took her telephones and she smashed them with a hammer. Right? And then she took the other ones, and she deleted them. And now the Mueller scam, these people, the worst people. I have a friend, a very smart guy, very streetwise guy. He said, “You have to be the most honest guy in the world to go through three years of investigations, where they have the worst human beings in the world.” They worked for the Democrats. They worked…

I mean, Mueller didn’t have a clue. This guy was totally… But look at this Weissmann, how bad was Weissmann? He deleted his phone. That’s illegal. He deleted everything. They all deleted. And they all said, “Oh gee, we made a mistake. We’re sorry.” They all used the same mistake. They all made… It was, “Oh gee, we didn’t mean to do that.” Every one of them, all of them. I think it was 31 different phones, they deleted. These are criminals we’re dealing with. And they’ve got to… There has to be a repercussion. There has to be a repercussion. We’re dealing with criminals. So I don’t care if you say it anymore because you know what? She illegally deleted, and her lawyers should go to jail with her, okay?

And the fact is the Republican party doesn’t play it rough and tough like those people, they don’t play it the same way. They’re too nice. And we have better policy. Thank goodness we have better… We believe in borders. We believe in no sanctuary cities. We believe in lowering taxes. We have better, but our people don’t… We have some that are very good. Jim Jordan, good, right?

Jim Jordan. Mark Meadows, good, right? No, we have some very good, but I’ll tell you what, we play it so nice, and in the end it’s not right because what they get away with… And Obama and Biden got caught spying on our campaign using the intelligence, I put that in quotes, using intelligence to spy on our campaign, and they got caught. They got caught. And if it was me that got caught, forget about it. But they got caught and somebody said, ” Well I know, but he was President.” Oh great, I’m President too. And a hell of a lot better President than he is, I can tell you that. Obama came into office, they gave him the Nobel Prize, like almost immediately, right? In fact, he didn’t even know why he got it. He didn’t even know, he had no idea why he got it. And he was right about that because nobody else does either. They still don’t know, but we’ve done a lot of things. So we were nominated a few days ago for a Nobel Prize, which is a big thing. Nobel Peace Prize.

And then yesterday we were nominated a second time for another Nobel Prize. Now, that’s a big thing. To me, it’s a big thing, even though obviously it’s a very political thing, but it’s a very big thing. The Nobel Peace Prize, right? I got, it was just reported. I’m just reporting this, I got zero time on the nightly news, on the network news. Zero, zero. We got zero time. Think of it, the President of your country is honored by being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and your nightly news, ABC, which is terrible, CBS, which is terrible, and probably the worst of all owned by Concast, they spend a fortune on PR, and then every time I get up, I call them Concast and sort of wipe out their fortune. But they are bad people. But NBC is the worst of them all, not one mentioned. These people are corrupt. Not one mentioned, not one mentioned.

So your President gets a Nobel and, at least a nomination, and they don’t mention it. Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he doesn’t really believe in our country. Right now, I don’t think he believes in anything, he just wants to go to sleep. That’s all. “Please, darling, I want to go to bed. I’m exhausted. I made one speech yesterday.” “But darling, they gave you the answers and the questions.” “I know, but that was a big strain because my eyes, I couldn’t see the teleprompter.” This guy is the worst. I am… And you know, it’s going to maybe come back to haunt me because we have a rigged election. It’s a rigged election. It’s the only way we’re going to lose, but I’ll tell you what, he is the worst candidate in the history of Presidential…

He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. He doesn’t know he’s alive. He doesn’t know he’s alive. And I got to know President Xi of China very well, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. By the way, what happened to the war? I thought we was going to war with Kim Jong-un. Where’s the war? Where’s the war? Oh, I see. Oh, I see. It never happened, did it? Never happened, did it?

Well, maybe some day, could happen. No, remember? “Trump is going to be … ” You know my personality, right? “Trump is going to be a war at within the first week after he wins.” Where’s the war.?In fact, the peace prize was because I stayed out of wars, and by the way, ended certain Wars that could have happened that you don’t even know about. And look what we did just yesterday in Europe, and look what we did with Israel, and you just saw that, with United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.

For 72 years, nothing happened, and we did it. We do it very fast. And plenty of other countries are going to be coming in. At Biden’s convention, they decried it. You’re a hell of a crowd. I’ll tell you. You’re [ 00:26:15].
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Now, after this is over, you’ll have like at NBC, this third-rate reporter stand up. They had a small crowd, a insignificant crowd, in a great location. You know how great it was? We landed, we had to drive for 50 minutes. That’s how great. But I like it anyway. I’ll take it. I’ll take it anyway. I like it. You’re my kind of people. We love each other. I like it.

We landed the big, beautiful Air Force One. I just asked as we’re coming in, “Why couldn’t we have landed here?” I would have rather, then I could have had the plane right behind me. Instead, we have the beast. See the beast. What you don’t know is the beast costs almost as much as the plane. It’s a hell of a car. It’s a walking army tank, the beast. But we could have. I said, “Why don’t we just land here?” And we couldn’t. So I get off the plane. Oh, good. “How long will it be?” “About 50 minutes.” That’s a long drive. And driving here, there were tens of thousands of people on the streets with flags.

And then you read these fake reporters and they say, “President Trump is tied in Nevada, tied.” I don’t think so. The only way we’re tied is if they screw around with the ballots, which they will do in my opinion. Okay? We’re not tied anywhere. I asked some people that traveled with Obama. I said, “Was it the same thing?” They say, “Not even a tiny fraction of what you have.” There’s not even a fraction. We have more enthusiasm. We have more spirit than any campaign that anybody’s ever seen. It’s true.

And that includes 2016, where the enthusiasm obviously was great. How about all those states that we weren’t supposed to win? “No, he won’t win there. He won’t win there.” Then all night long, “Donald Trump won the great state of Texas. Donald Trump won the great state of … ” this and that, and one after another. Was that one of the coolest things, watching their people go crazy? They went crazy. No, they went crazy.

How is he going to do in Georgia? Well, I think George is going to be very close. It’s going to be very close. They go, “The polls in Georgia have closed. Donald Trump wins the state of Georgia.” You know why? Because we won by so much, that they can do it simultaneously by saying, “The polls closed, and he won.” We had many of them. Right? And by the way, we’re doing great. I just had … Florida is a biggie, a good one. And we are winning in Florida by a lot, so that’s good. A lot.

I’ll tell you here, because you don’t read about that stuff. They don’t like to write that. They don’t like to write it. They have all fake polls. I’ll tell you what, the polls are worse than the writing. Actually, in my opinion, the polls, they’re suppression polls, they’re meant to make people discouraged, Even me, I’m supposed to be discouraged. And fortunately, four years ago, we weren’t discouraged, because if we would have believed the polls, nobody would have voted.

The concept is really make people feel so that on election, they go, “Darling, let’s go out to dinner. It’s so sad about the president. I wish he was going to win, but let’s go out to dinner. Then we’ll come home. Let’s not bother voting, right? Let’s not bother voting.” See, it’s a suppression, but my people might don’t get suppressed. My people go out and vote.

My people go out and vote. There’s no suppression. Phony polls. How about the guy? The New York times hired this pollster, this great genius. He never called one wrong. I don’t know. Three, 46.. I don’t know what the hell … It’s called three 40 … What’s his deal?
Yeah. It’s Silver, Silver, Nate Silver. They pay him a fortune. He said, I think he gave us a 2% chance, A 3% chance, “Donald Trump has a 3% chance today of winning.” The damn thing was over by 10:00.

We were given a very tiny chance. What chance did he give us? Like 9%, something like that. You know, they gave him millions of dollars shortly before, because he never called one wrong. He called that one wrong. He called that one wrong. And this is the one … I mean, I must tell you they’re a little more accurate. At least here they have us even in a lot of places. ” He’s even.” Well, we’re not even, we’re not even.

This is going to be the greatest victory. This is a more important election than four years ago, I’ll tell you, more important. Because at no time before, has there been a clearer choice between two parties or two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. There’s never been anything like this. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, like we had.

We had the greatest economy in the history … not of our country, in the world. We were beating everybody. We were beating China. Remember, if you go back, some of you go back, if you go back 10 years, 15 years, five years, everything was … In 2019, China will overtake the United States as the largest economy. And that didn’t work out too well for them. That didn’t work out. We were just doing leaps and bounds. We were doing so great, and then we got hit with the plague, the China plague. And we’re not thrilled. It’s a disgrace. Nobody should have died. Nobody should have died. We got hit. The whole world got hit, but they stopped it from going into the rest of China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop it from coming into the US and Europe and 188 countries.

So whether or not we allow Biden to impose the biggest tax increase in the history of our country, $4 trillion, or ban … He wants to ban energy, ban American … He wants to stop fracking. Hey, by the way, when he was running as a Democrat, in the worst debate performances I’ve ever seen. Okay? What do you think … He was unable to answer anything. Are you awake, sir? Sir, please wake up. And who was the worst? Who treated him the worst? Kamala. Kamala.

She’s another beauty. She started off as a favorite. She was at 15. Then she went down to 14, to 12, to 10. She was like a dropping rock in water. She was going down so fast. Then she went down to five and four and three, two, and then she said, “I got to get the hell out of here. This is getting embarrassing.”

And nobody treated him worse than Kamala. Right? She called him a racist. She called him everything. She was horrible to him. And he says, “She was Kamala. She’s just great.” Oh, yeah. These people, these people. You’re supposed to choose the people that did well. She got out before Iowa, as I remember. Right? She didn’t want to run in Iowa, and then Bernie got … Again, this guy is the greatest loser ever because-
No, no. No, he’s a good sport, Bernie, crazy Bernie. He’s so crazy, but he’s a good sport, because with Hillary, they really did.

Do we have any young children here? I know it’s on a lot of television. Could you turn the television off just for a minute, just for about three seconds? He got screwed. Right? Okay. Now you can turn it back on. But then they really did with this last one, because if Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, if she would have left the race one day before the big Super Tuesday, I mean, Bernie would have her philosophy, right? Liberals.

By the way, you know who’s more liberal than Bernie? Kamala. She’s rated the number one most liberal … This is not for Nevada. This is not for [ 00:35:04]. And I would say, she’ll be president. If he ever wants, she’ll be president within the first month or so, I would say. I think it’s just an excuse. Using him as just an excuse to get the super libs in there, so they can destroy our suburbs, demolish our Second Amendment, erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous, anti-American lies in school. So under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we’re doing it again. We’re doing it again. You’ve seen the numbers. And we’re developing a vaccine in record time. It will be ready before the end of the year and maybe much sooner than that. They’re very unhappy about that. It’s amazing.

We have a couple of really great experts, one who’s … We call him Dr. Scott. You know who I’m talking about? He’s great. He said, this is the only time … They were grilling him on television, saying, “Well, the vaccine’s going too fast.” You know why that’s too fast? Because they don’t want it to happen before the election. He said, “This is the only thing in the world. I’ve never seen anything like it. Everybody wants a vaccine. And when we start getting it fast, because President Trump happens to be president … ” and we’ve done this in record time, years ahead of schedule. If this was Sleepy Joe and Obama, you wouldn’t have a vaccine for three years. But listen, he said, “This is the craziest thing.”

So you’re going to have a vaccine quickly. Right? And everybody’s upset about it. So now they’re trying to hurt the vaccine. And they’re trying to say as many bad … They know nothing about it, but they’re trying to hurt it, and it’s a shame. But he said it better than anybody I’ve heard. He said, “You’re trying to hurt this country by saying bad things about the vaccine, because we’re going to produce it early.” It’s the craziest thing. Think about it. Now, having a vaccine is good, but we’re rounding the turn regardless. We’re rounding the turn, and it’s happening. I mean, it’s happening. You see. Florida is way down. Texas is now way down. Arizona, governor’s done a great job. All three governors have done a great job. And Louisiana now, they had a spike, but they had the spike, but the spike was able to be handled, because now we understand. And what we did, we saved millions of lives, because I hated to do it, but we had to close it up, understand this disease, and then open up again.

And we opened, but we would have had 2 million, two and a half, or three million people. Think of it. We’re at like around 180,000. One is too many. One, too many. But we would’ve had two and a half, three, three and a half million people. It would not have been acceptable, would not have been sustainable. We’ve done an incredible job. And these people that have done it with me, the ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics, these people … I mean the hospitals, the beds that we built, the ships that we sent to New York, the ships that we sent. To have an ungrateful governor in New York, Cuomo, to have an ungrateful governor. We sent him ships. We sent them ships. We sent them.

We built a convention center with 2,800 beds, and he didn’t use the beds for senior citizens. He hardly used the beds at all. He hardly used the ships at all. He said we did a phenomenal job, and now he gets political. He wants to get political with me. A real wise guy, but that’s okay. You got to see what they are doing between him and de Blasio. That’s a beauty. What they’ve done to my beautiful city. I love that city so much. What they’ve done is so horrible. The highest taxes in the land, crime all over the place. They’re like 300% up in crime. We need Rudy to come out of retirement. But we’re defeating the China virus. When Biden was vice president, he was a complete disaster on the swine flu, which was a much easier thing to handle. Joe Biden’s own chief of staff said that when Biden managed swine flu in 2009, they quote, “Did every possible thing wrong.” This is the guy that worked for him in charge of the swine flu. And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in a period of time. And it’s just purely a … He said it was just … we were lucky. He said, “It’s just lucky that there weren’t great mass casualties.” Different kinds of a disease, a little bit.

And what he said is amazing. He said we did nothing right. This is the man that’s going to tell us all about building ventilators. You think Joe is going to be able to build thousands of ventilators a month? Which now we’re doing, and sending them to all these countries, all over the world, who have no hope of building ventilators, and they need them badly.
So it’s an amazing thing. The outbreak was so rampant that Obama-Biden, the administration, told States to stop testing immediately, and they ordered the CDC to stop counting cases because they looked like hell, okay? We didn’t do that. By the way, the reason we show so many cases, because we have the best testing program in the world, by far, by far.

We’ve tested more people than India, than many, many big countries put together. India’s second. We’re 44 million tests ahead of India. They have 1.5 billion people, and Prime Minister Modi calls me. He says, “What a job you’ve done with testing.” I said, “Explain that to these dishonest people back
Biden’s record demonstrates that if he had been in charge when the China virus arrived, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. As vice president, he presided over the worst and the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. You’ve heard that before. It was the most pathetic recovery since the Depression. No state was hit harder by Biden’s failure than Nevada. And I was out here and that right about that. You got hit hard. This is not the guy you want.

But under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in the history of Nevada. And we’ll soon have it back there again. We’ll soon have it back there again, but I hope everybody here, 25,000 people, whatever the hell it is, including those people back there, they’re angry at me. I don’t know why we gave the press this good location, because … No, it blocks the people … thousands of people back there, and the press is blocking them. And I consider them much more important than I do the press.

But Biden wants to raise your taxes so high. He would eradicate your economy. He’d put on new regulations, and it wouldn’t be him again. I’m going to keep saying it. It will be the people that control him. He’s a puppet. And then he wants to do a complete shutdown. We’re setting records. We just set a job record for four months, 10.4 million people.

Listen to this. So when we had this pandemic worldwide, look, it’s a terrible thing that a thing like this happened. People were saying we could go to 41, 42% unemployment. You know what we are now? 8.4%. I don’t say that’s …

If you would have said that … And we have the strongest, highest stock market in history, so your 401ks are doing great. If he got in, we would have the greatest depression in the history of our country. I mean it. I think 1929 would look like good times. All right? Because he’d do everything wrong. He’d raise your taxes. He’d raised the hell out of interest rates. He’d do everything wrong. The Biden shutdown will permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of Americans, inflict totally lasting harm on our children and lead countless deaths from suicide. Don’t forget when you do these shutdowns, your state is shut down.

You got a governor. You shut down, except if you have a riot. You’re not shut down for riots. Riots, you can have, they can burn the hell out of the Strip. They can burn the hell out of Reno. They can do whatever the hell they want if it’s a riot. But if you want to go to church, you can’t do it. If you want to be in a group of people, you can’t do it. But there’s a lot of harm done on the other side. There’s a lot of tremendous harm done. Remember, the cure can’t be worse. Remember that.

And on the other side, drugs, suicide, depression, substance abuse of different kinds, heart disease. You have tremendous problems on the other side. Open your schools, open up. We got to open up this state. And I guarantee you …

And by the way, the states that are open are doing really well. They’re doing much better than the ones that are closed. I don’t know if you’ve been seeing the numbers. And this is just arithmetic. The states that are open are doing great. The states that are closed, North Carolina, what he’s doing to that great state, he’s got it locked down, shut down. Michigan, what she’s doing. And we’re trying to get Big 10 football by the way, but we won’t even. Michigan, what she’s doing to Michigan is unbelievable.

Take a look at what they’re doing to Pennsylvania. And here’s another governor in charge of millions of ballots. So I’m going to win Pennsylvania, but what’s he going to do with these ballots? Where are they going? Who are they sending? Who’s sending it back? Who’s signing? They don’t even have to have an authorized signature in Nevada. Do you know that? They don’t have to have …

You don’t have to have an authorized signature on a ballot? No. They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. I hope you’re all going to be poll-watchers, I hope you are, because with you people watching the polls, it’s going to be pretty hard to cheat. I’ll tell you, I wouldn’t want to be a cheater. They’ll figure a way. No, they are. It’s a very dangerous thing.

It’s a very dangerous thing, and I totally mean it. And I’ve been at it. And you see people. And by the way, it’s not even politics. It’s common sense. They said millions of ballots. People are getting ballots. People died and they’re getting ballots. They’re sending them to dogs. You see that? Dogs got ballot. Everybody’s getting ballots. Probably everybody, but Republican are going to get the ballots. Right? And they’re unsolicited. So when you say, solicited, because I like solicited better as a word than absentee. Absentee, nobody knows what the hell it’s supposed to represent. It’s not really a good definition. One is solicited, where you ask … You solicit the ballot.

You want it, you sign papers. They send it to you. You send it back. It’s okay. It’s good. But unsolicited, where they take millions of ballots. So what happens? I happen to think the postal people are great, but what happens if one of the post guys, before he gives the ballots, he takes a whole handful and hands them to some Democrat political operative, right?

And so, he hands him a thousand ballots, and the guy doesn’t even have to … you don’t have to have verification to do that. Now, here’s the good news. We’re in front of a court. And hopefully, the court’s going to rule, because this is the greatest scam in the history of presidential politics. These people are … they’ve gone crazy.

Biden and his party of liberal hypocrites want to lock law-abiding Americans in their homes, which is what they’re doing. And they want to keep them out of church. They really do. They’re fighting God, they’re fighting guns, and they’re fighting oil. Think of it. I don’t think they’ll do too well in Texas. Did you see where they said? “We think the race will be quite close in Texas, but the president has an edge.” Listen, I’m in favor of oil and energy. I’m in favor of religion and God. Okay? And I’m in favor of our great Second Amendment, guns.

So he’s against our Second Amendment. Okay, you know who he’d put in charge. Beto, Beto. Or as he says is, “Beto, Beto.” So when Beto was legit and then Ted Cruz beat him, and Ted did a very good job. I tell you, he did a great job. But Beto went totally south. He’s gone crazy. So he now is a big gun guy. He wants to take guns away from everybody. So who did Biden put in charge? Beto.

Remember Beto was interviewed in some magazine or third-rate magazine, most of them are, but remember? And Beto said, this was at the beginning before he got beat to hell. I said, “He thought this was easy, didn’t he?”

But remember when Beto said, “I was born for this.” As soon as I hear somebody’s born for running for president, I said, “He’s out. That’s the end of him.” Nobody’s born for this. This is tough stuff. I had a great life, I’ll tell you. My life was so beautiful. What the hell did I do this for? But you know what? You know what? We are doing things that nobody’s ever done before.

And I say it all the time, and that’s what makes me happy. We’re dealing with very sick and very bad and evil people. But I’ll tell you no administration in three-and-a-half years, no administration has done what we’ve done in the first three-and-a-half years. But they want to punish you for praying in church while they let agitators and arsonists burn your churches down.

Look at Washington. They want to burn the churches down, and that’s fine. But you want to go pray in church, they won’t let you do that. Just last week, Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of pro-criminal, anti-police, Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals, and violent extremists without any charges. No charges. Never saw anything.

By the way, all of these places were talking about are Democrat- run, Chicago, New York, Portland, Seattle. The only reason Seattle got settled, because they knew we were going in. We told them, “we’re going in tomorrow morning. We’re going to open it up. We’re going to take it.” It would have taken us 20 minutes. So they sent people that night, because they didn’t want to be embarrassed. But look at what we’ve done. And so, every place we’ve touched, we solved the crime, but they have to ask us. If they don’t ask us, we’re not supposed to do it, but maybe we do it anyway. And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to …

And it usually takes anywhere from 25 minutes to about one hour. Wasn’t that a beautiful sight though in Minneapolis, right? They’re burning the poor city down. I love that state. I think we have a chance of winning in that state, first time in many years for a Republican. They’re burning Minneapolis. You don’t think of Minneapolis that way, right? You don’t think of it. The city is burning down. You have this fake CNN reporter, what’s his name? Velshi, the nice shaved head. Maybe I should try that, should I try that? No, I don’t think … ” Donald Trump went down substantially in the polls, like about 40%. He showed up with a new haircut, it’s called the shave head.” Ali Velshi. And remember he said, “No, this is a friendly protest. It’s a friendly protest. And it’s really quite nice.” And people are throwing bottles at him, he’s being hit with tear gas. This is a friendly protest. And you look over his shoulder and the entire city was burning.

Do you remember the scene? The thing looked like it was 30 blocks, it was just burning. And he’s talking about, this is all fake news and nobody would have known. I knew it before I did it, but I never knew it to this extent. I never knew it to this extent. It is corrupt. It’s fake and they shouldn’t be allowed to do it. They shouldn’t be allowed. These are far left lunatics that Biden selects to staff his government. There are policies Biden’s pledged to apply nationwide. You’re going to have the suburbs, they have a plan. It doesn’t matter, it’s a regulation, very horrible regulation for the … Does anybody live in the suburbs? Because if you don’t vote for Trump in the suburbs, okay.
Women that live in the suburbs. They say, “Oh, they don’t like Donald Trump.” I said, “I think they do.” Remember last time, remember it’s the same thing. No, it’s the same thing. Remember, last time, four years ago, “Donald Trump will not do well with women.” I said, “Why am I so bad? Donald Trump will not …” And then the votes started coming in. “He’s doing very well, Jim, with women, I don’t know what’s going on.” We did very well with women. We did well with everybody, we did well with everybody. But they have a regulation. And Ben Carson was fantastic, the head of HUD. I said, “Ben, they’re going to destroy the suburbs.” And they wanted Corey Booker to head that program. But the program was already doing damage. They were playing with the zoning so they could build projects in the suburb, projects in the suburbs. And I said, “We’re going to end it.” Somebody said, “Sir, let’s just amend it.” I said, “Nope, we got to end it. End it, I want to end it. I don’t want to have a lesser version.”

But if he gets in, they will open up that whole program. They’re going to open it up on steroids. They’re going to open it up to a level that you wouldn’t have believed possible. And he will drive you out of the suburbs. He will drive you out of the … he’ll drive you out of everything. They’re open up their … I call it the suburban destruction program because that’s what they’ve done. And it’s been a horrible program. It’s been very unfair to people with the American dream. And let me just tell you something. 30% of the people that live in the suburbs are minorities. They’re Hispanic, they’re Black, they’re Asian, it’s the American dream. And they want the American dream and they don’t want that to happen. That’s why I’m doing so well with African American, with Asian American, with Hispanic American and with women. But don’t let them ruin the suburbs because they will put that regulation back immediately, immediately. And don’t let them ruin the suburbs because the suburbs are a special place. The suburbs are the American dream.

That’s where everyone aspires to and that includes minorities and everybody. Don’t let them ruin the suburbs. And with that comes tremendous crime. And I was talking the other day, “Darling, somebody just moved next door. Who is it? It’s a representative of Antifa.” She will look at her husband, say, “Darling, we’re out of here. We’re out of here.” Antifa. Remember they were trying to blame other people. They don’t like to mention the name Antifa. I said, it’s Antifa and I was right. I was right. They’re bad people. And you know what, they have to pay a price for the damage and for the horror that they’ve caused, they have to pay a price. And it’s so easy. It’s so easy. A lot of them now are wealthy. They’re like these wealthy, spoiled kids that have no clue about life.

They’ve got arms that are about this big but they were heavy jackets with lots … and you look and you say, “Oh, that guy looks tough.” And then the jacket comes off and you see these two little … And they go home and they live in a basement too, their mom and dad’s basement. But Biden’s plan is to appease domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He does whatever his left wing, puppet masters demand, you know that. Look, Joe doesn’t know what’s going on, you know that. I mean, let’s be nice about it, okay. And I’m being nice when I say it. He’ll never be able to protect your family, your loved ones or your community. If Biden’s elected his radical supporters won’t just cause mayhem on the streets like you’re seeing, all Democrats. We could solve it so fast. Chicago, a few weekends, think of it, 72 people shot, this is shot. Somebody said, “You mean with bullets?” I said, “Yeah, with bullets.” 18 people died. Now we’re pulling our troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq, you see what’s happening.

But let me tell you but we don’t … there’s nothing like that over there. They don’t have 18 people killed or 12 people in a short period of time. Well, you have 70 people shot, where you have another weekend where they had, I think a few weekends ago, 38 people have been shot in Chicago. I said, 38? It’s not even believable. And now when these people say it, they make it … they try and play it down. And you’re sitting there, I said, “Did I just see 38 people were shot?” It’s just a terrible thing. And it could all be stopped. It could all be stopped so quickly. But they have to respect law and they have to have order. Law and order.

But these radical lefts will be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Supreme Court. And you see what’s going on there. If we don’t … The next president, hopefully it’s going to be us, not me, us, but the next president is going to have one, two, three or four Supreme Court justice. It’s just, you know, just that time, right? Just that time, going to be a minimum of one, I would say, but it will be a one, two, three or four. And that’s going to change the whole makeup of the Supreme Court. That’s going to take away your guns. That’s going to destroy your second amendment. That’s going to change the whole rationale thinking on so many different subjects like you wouldn’t believe, including by the way, life, okay. Life, pro-life, anybody pro-life here? No, this is going to change the makeup of this country for 50 years. I don’t know that the country will survive 50 years, if that happens, it might not survive five years if that happens. But the next president and you saw, I put out a list of an additional number of very conservative, highly thought of, highly respected judges. And they are the only people that I will pick. Meaning the first list, the second list, it’s about 44, 45 people. They are the only people that I will consider for the Supreme Court of the United States. And I’m asking Joe Biden to do the same thing, but he can’t because he’s got a bunch of radical left maniacs that they want to put on the court. And nobody can get elected, not even with Democrats, rational Democrats, will they vote for some of these people to be on.

So far he’s refused to do it. I’m probably forcing him tonight to do something, but he should put out a list of his judges so that you know where you stand. Biden supports cutting police funding, you know that, abolishing … and by the way, did you see, we just got Chicago police today endorsed Trump. That’s not easy to do. Chicago. New York’s finest, New York’s finest endorse, Florida, Ohio, Texas. We have everybody. Is there a police officer in the country, if there is, they’ll do a commercial. This officer loves sleepy Joe Biden, he’s so tough on crime. So Biden’s been going down very rapidly in the polls. And now what he’s doing is he’s playing tough guy, that he’s tough on crime. And all of a sudden, he goes from demolished, demolish and defund, okay? But he goes from, let’s not give the police any money. Let’s not even say defund for him. His people want to defund the police. They actually have places, Seattle, they actually don’t want to have police. Minneapolis, they don’t want to have police. They don’t want to have police. What’s going to happen?

You saw the commercial we put up. A woman’s being murdered. “I’m sorry. We cannot take your call right now. We will call you back within the next 24 hours.” A woman’s being raped, right? “I’m sorry. We could not respond right now because we have been defunded, but we will try getting there within the next week.” This is what you’re going to have. I mean, that was a strong commercial. It had a big impact, but this is what you’re buying with a guy like this. This guy you’re going to have Portland’s all over this country. And we can’t allow that to happen. “Not here,” he says, “Not here in Nevada.” Well with your governor, it could happen here too, I can tell. They want to abolish bail. So they want to abolish cash bail like they did in New York. They release people, the horrible criminals in New York, they release them, no cash bail. And he calls law enforcement, Biden called law enforcement the enemy. They’re not the enemy. They’re our friends. They’re our great friends.

And without them, we wouldn’t be here. Here in Nevada rioters burned the city hall in Reno. Does anybody know that? Do you know that? That’s not a pleasant sight. How did you allow that to happen? I would’ve thought you people would’ve gotten out there, like, “You’re not going to burn our city hall.” And during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas a 29- year-old police officer, you know about this, was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job, a vicious criminal left, he was a left person, a left. He was a real left, all right. And the, the young officer as you know, he’s a young, brilliant, young guy and he’s totally paralyzed. Unlike Biden, while I’m President of the United States, I will always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement. And on November 3rd, you will save America. You’re talking about saving America. We cannot let this happen to our country. Because I don’t know if you can ever come back from what will happen, including our Supreme Court.
 
We’re joined tonight by our terrific Republican congressional nominee, who has my complete and total endorsement. Jim, where you Jim? Jim Marchant, Jim Marchant, where are you? A lot of people out there, Jim, it’s not easy. Are you doing well? I just looked at a very solid poll. Jim Marchant is a great guy and hopefully he’s going to win and you’re going to carry them over and you need it, you need it. Thank you, Jim. And also to a man that should have been governor. He should have been governor, what happened? I don’t know what happened. Nevada Attorney General, he’s a great guy, Adam Laxalt. And he’s watching very closely. And I’ll tell you, Adam, please, he’s a great lawyer, a great talent. And he’s going places but you have to watch. He just said, our next governor. I believe that’s true. You have my endorsement, but I will tell you this, Adam, if you could, because you’re doing a fantastic job watching, watch all these votes coming in on the ballots, the unsolicited ballots. Will you watch it, please? Okay, all right.

All right, James Settelmeyer. Where’s James? James, look at James, whoa. Look at the size of James, I want you protecting me, James. James is good. You’re doing well, I saw a good poll for you too. I think we’re all doing well. I think we’re all doing well, it’s like a family. Thank you James very much. All of you guys, thank you very much. A woman who did a fantastic job, she headed up Michigan. We won Michigan, the first time in decades, Republicans won. She was horrendous, she kept calling me, “Sir, one more speech, please come over. Okay, I’ll do one more, Ronna, Ronna McDaniel. I’ll do one more, Ronna, one more.” I do the speech, two days later, I get a call. “One more, sir. We need one more.” But we ended up winning Michigan, first time in decades. Ronna McDaniel, Ronna. She was great.

And I said when I won, I said, “Well, who are we going to put at the RNC?” That’s Republican National Committee, who we’re going to put? And I said, ” How about that woman that ran …” She was so tough. I said, “How about the woman that ran Michigan that we won, first time in so many years?” So thank you, Ronna, great job you’re doing, we appreciate it. And another man is doing a fantastic job, who’s been a friend of mine for a long time, your GOP chair, Michael McDonald. Michael, great job, Michael. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Mike. How are we doing, Michael? Are we leading, I hope? Okay. I hear we’re doing well. Be careful of the ballots, that’s the only way we’re going to lose. Can’t have this happen to our country.

And also here are several really great members of a terrific association and they like Trump a lot, the Nevada Trucking Association. Where are they, Nevada Trucking? Nevada Trucking, thank you, thank you. Thank you, fellas, thank you very much. Great job, we appreciate it very much. Those roads are going to get very nice. They’re already starting. Tonight our hearts are with all of the communities in the West battling devastating wildfires. I’m going there the day after tomorrow. I’m staying in your state tonight, but I’m going to be going to California. Spoke to the folks in Oregon, Washington, they never had anything like this, but it is about forest management. Please remember the words, very simple, forest management, please remember. It’s about forest management and other things but forest management.

My administration is closely coordinating with state and local leaders and we want to thank the more than 200,000 people that are working on it and 28,000 firefighters and first responders who courageously and bravely are fighting out there. They are fighting and it’s dangerous, it’s dangerous. It’s rapidly spreading, hundreds of thousands of acres, it’s not been anything quite like this one. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the past 47 years. Think of it, he’s been there 47 years. And he always says, “Well, why didn’t you do this? Why did …” The guy just really in all fairness, I’ve been here three and a half years. So it’s not like they haven’t been here. He was a vice president for eight years and he only did one thing good. He treated Obama good. I was going to say something else, but they would have scolded me.
That’s exactly what I was going to say, but I didn’t. It’s better than you say it. Do you want to shout it out? Go ahead, shout.
That’s what I said, that’s what I was … thank you very … This can only happen in Nevada. And we pass record tax cuts and regulation cuts to keep the family farms and ranches in the family. Nobody even knows this. We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. Does anyone have a small farm, medium-sized farm or business? Anybody? If you want to leave it to your children, you don’t have to pay tax now because of Trump. I always say it and I mean it, if you like your children, it’s great. If you don’t like your children, it doesn’t mean a damn thing, don’t leave it to them. I ended the administrations … and if you look at that last administration, what they were doing on American energy, what they were doing, and now we are the world’s number one energy producer by far and we are energy independent.

How about your gas prices? That’s not too bad, right? You didn’t think you’d ever see those prices, those under two dollar prices, did you? Thank you President Trump, I appreciate it, sir. Biden has pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, and he wants to ban fracking, right? So he’s in these debates with the other people and they’re just eating him alive. He did his best debate against crazy Bernie and I got to ask, why did he get better, all of a sudden? What happened? Why, do you have any idea why? I think I know. Why did he get better all of a sudden? But he did his last event, but he was so bad. And he raised his hand, no fracking. “There will be no fracking under my administration,” he said. And you know why I add the word, he said, because they will take what I said and they will put it as a commercial. There will be no fracking under my administration, they’ll have me saying that. That’s how dishonest these people are.

So I always have to add something because … but even then sometimes they’ll cut it off at the end. But he said, there’ll be no fracking under my administration. Now, all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania and his polls aren’t looking very good because they do big fracking. And he goes to Texas and he goes to Oklahoma and he goes to North Dakota and he goes to all these places. It’s not looking so good. All of a sudden he says, “I have nothing against fracking. What are you talking about?” But always follow their first instinct because the first instinct is what is going to happen. And he has to, because he signed … he has a manifesto. I call it the manifesto with Bernie and AOC plus three, all these crazy people. And it’s a manifesto and it reads far worse than anything Bernie Sanders ever said. I thought he’d take what Bernie did and move them somewhat to the right. No, he took what Bernie said and they moved way further left. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. But follow the original statements because that’s what’s going to happen.

Whether it’s on religion or on guns or on fracking or on energy or anything, that’s what’s going to happen. California has already implemented this extreme agenda and they are experiencing massive blackouts, you know that, California. They like wind, they like wind. “Oh, darling, let’s watch television. I’m sorry, darling. The wind, the wind isn’t blowing tonight we can’t watch television. But I want to watch President Trump, he’s on television. I want to watch him. Darling, how many times do I have to tell you? The wind is not blowing tonight.” And the government came and turned off all the windmills because they’re killing all our bald eagles and all our birds. It’s unbelievable. You want to see a bird cemetery walk under a windmill sometime. They pile up. Honestly, it’s terrible. Then the environmentalists will say, oh, that’s so wonderful. You know what, when they talk about fumes, when they talk about going up, the carbon, going up, take a look where they’re made. They’re made in China and they’re made in Germany. They spew more crap into the air than anything. You can run those things for 15 years and they’ll never make up the difference. But here’s what happens, after a certain number of years, they wear out. And did you ever see a windmill when it’s shot, like Joe, what happens? No, you know what happens to it. It starts to rust, they don’t paint it. The maintenance gets bad and then they just turn it off. Take a look at California where they have windmills that have been … that are old. And nobody wants to take them down because it’s not a lot of profit in taking them down. So they’re sitting there all rotten and rusty, it’s terrible. And then I hear the environmentalists love them. We got to talk to the environmentalists [ 01:11:26].

And they cannot … you know solar, I like solar, but solar is very expensive and it doesn’t have the power to fire up our massive plants. We have big plants, including in this great state and you can’t fire them up with this stuff. You can’t fire it. We need the strength because we’re competing against a lot of nations and they don’t go through what we do. They don’t care about the air and they should, and they should, which is another problem. I took you out of that crazy Paris Climate Accord, because it was totally disaster. No, it was a way of hurting the United States. I tell you, we would have had a close 20, 25% of our factories in order to even … it was so crazy, so expensive but I took you out. I was surprised people, most people, they appreciate what I did. Because you think it was easy doing that? It was actually, I thought it would be devastating. I got one day of bad press, after that, everybody forgot about it. It wasn’t that bad. But I did the right thing for our country and we want to have our great plants working. We want to have our great plants fired up.

They said manufacturing jobs are dead, right? Sleepy Joe said, “I’m going to bring back manufacturing.” Really? Well, Obama said, you’d need a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 650,000 jobs. He said you’d need a miracle. And now sleepy Joe is saying that, no, no, no. I’ve got to bring back … He’s not going to bring back anything. I made history by signing an executive order making the official policy of the United States government to buy American and to hire American. Now I did this long time ago. And then I see a sign in front of Joe right here, right here, it said, buy American. Oh great, Joe, thanks, Joe. Where have you been for 47 years? Because for 47 years, Joe Biden did the opposite. He crushed the dreams of American workers and enriched foreign countries. That’s how China happened. Hey, look what I’ve done. I’ve taken billions, tens of billions of dollars out of China. Nobody else did it before me, I mean, no other president. In all fairness, in all fairness to Obama and Biden, I call him, Obiden because it’s easier, Obiden.

In all fairness to Obiden, I mean, they didn’t do any of that. But now I see buy American. Hey, he also copied on the pandemic. Did you see he copied everything I was doing? Except one thing, he wouldn’t have closed the country to China so hundreds of thousands of people would have died from that. But two months, two and a half months later, he admitted that I was right. Thank you very much, Joe, I appreciate it. And yesterday he made, I think he made a mistake. Well, what do you think, the USMCA, what’s better that or NAFTA? Well, no, the USMCA is better. Was that Jake Tapper? I like Jake Tapper, was that … I don’t think he was doing … I don’t think he likes me too much, but that’s okay. They said what’s better, they said, what’s better. He goes, “USMCA. Well, that’s the deal that Trump made. Oh, it is? Oh.”

That’s a great deal we made. We took the horrible NAFTA deal. We got rid of the NAFTA. We got rid of TPP. We got rid of that terrible, terrible South Korea deal, which Hillary Clinton said, will produce 250,000 jobs. She said, this will produce 200 … she made it. Hillary, crooked Hillary. She made it, no wait, she said it’s going to produce 250,000 jobs. And she was 100% right, it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea, not for us.

It produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Not for us. South Korea did very well with that deal, but I changed that deal a lot. That’s now a good deal. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers. When we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.

You’re not going to see companies leaving for Mexico very much anymore. They’re not going to be leaving your community, going to Mexico, making a product, selling the product back in, not being taxed at the border. Doesn’t work that way anymore.

It’s probably the biggest reason I ran for president if you want to know that… and these stupid, endless wars. I saved the Uni-… but that’s one of the reasons Washington doesn’t like me. They love those endless wars. You got to ask them, “Why?” Do you ever watch where they’re very critical of me.

I mean, “We don’t like him on foreign policy.” Really? Look what I’ve done. Look what I’ve done. Israel… We’re signing deals all over the place. These guys that are lecturing all the time, they don’t have a clue. They’re clueless. They were clueless. That’s why for 40 years you got nothing except blood in the sand. That’s all you got. Blood in the sand.

I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of American jobs. They don’t like me too much. Joe Biden’s agenda is, “Made in China”. My agenda is, “Made in the USA”. That’s the way.

For the last four years, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic… I love a Hispanic community. Oh, there was a poll today. Did you see it? Did you see the poll? Oh, this was a biggie. They had a poll today that with the Hispanic voter, they call them Latino, Hispanic. They use different terms. To me, I just loved the people. I don’t care, but let me just… Did you see it?

Trump is leading Biden with the Hispanic community. Trump is leading Biden. Well, Hispanics like tough people. They like people that are going to produce jobs. They like… And by the way, the Hispanics understand the border better than anybody else. They’re better than anybody else. No, but we’re being… you know, it’s unusual that a Republican would be leading a Democrat, not… it’s habit. You know what the problem is, it’s habit. But the Hispanics get it.

And we’re leading with the Hispanic community. And that’s because you had the lowest job numbers in the history of our country. You had the best home ownership. Every statistic was the best. And now we’re doing it again, except we’re doing it very rapidly. Remember 8.4%. We could have been at 44%, if stupid people ran it, 8.4%.

I’m fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes and regulations on Hispanic-owned, small businesses. We’re fighting. You know, the Hispanic-owned, small businesses, they’re great business people. I know it from being in business. They were very tough. They were great business people and they get it. They get it like very few people get it. I’m also standing up for religious liberty.

Joe Biden would be… So Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the Hispanic communities, pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations, like the Little Sisters of the Poor that we’re helping. And we’re winning with them. We’re helping them. They got hit so hard by Oh Biden. They got hit so hard. I remember them in the Supreme Court, the Little Sisters of the Poor. They get hit by Biden. And then he says, “How wonderful.” He’s such a wonderful person. He supports taxpayer-funded, extreme, late-term abortion. And I mean, ninth month, ninth month, ninth month.

And he’d allow violent mobs to burn down your business. And he would hand your country over to the socialists. But I believe it’s worse than socialists. I do. I think it’s a step worse than socialist. And it starts with a C. That is why we’re going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote in November. So important. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

It’s so important. We’re bringing it back very fast. I think next year is… Next year, I believe will be as good or better than the year we had last year. Unless somebody comes in and decides to quadruple your taxes, then I can’t. Then all bets are off, but we’re going to have… We’re lowering taxes. He’s raising taxes. We’re going to have tremendous growth.

Joe Biden’s party continues to attack our incredible border agents. They’re incredible people, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic-Americans. Did you know that? I know all of them. “Jose, how you doing?” “Juan, how you doing?” Every sixth time, I’d say, “Hello, Jim, how are you?” These extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration, gratitude and respect, not Joe Biden’s contempt. He’s got contempt for these people that are so great and brave.

That’s a tough job. My administration’s achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release disaster. Remember you’d catch somebody, “What’s your name?” “I don’t know.” “What’s your address?” “I don’t know.” “Okay. Go into our country. That’s okay.” You couldn’t arrest anybody. We ended it, stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported over 20,000 gang members, including MS13 and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens.

Now think about it. Think of that number. Think if you at a half a million people spread throughout the country that were criminal, illegal aliens. Some of these are very violent people and we get them the hell out. We’re stopping human trafficking, protecting the victims, most of whom are women, most of whom are women. Human trafficking because of the internet that’s a tremendously big and horrible business. These are the worst human beings of all.

But most of the victims are women, children to a much lesser extent, but women and human traffickers. And you know what made it that way is the internet. Who would think? It almost sounds like an ancient crime. It’s not. It’s very modern because of the internet because of the computer. And it’s a horrible thing and we’ve stopped so much of it. We have an incredible group of people that go after these animals.

And we built now over 320 miles of border wall and are adding 10 new miles a week. And the wall will very soon be finished. It’ll be finished. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We’ve rebuilt our depleted… It was a depleted military. Now we have the newest, we have the best we’ve ever had and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the US Space Force.

And we did things that people said couldn’t be done. After 52 years, we passed VA Choice in VA Accountability and 91% of our veterans now approve of their VA care. They think it’s doing great. The fact is I did more in 47 months as president than Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi.

We eliminated the world’s number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani. He’s dead. He’s gone. Biden voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development. Oh, really? Tell me about it. Tell me about it. Not too positive.

Joe Biden has been on the wrong side of history for 47 years. In fact, the secretary of state, secretary of defense said about him, “He’s never called it right. He never called it right.” If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would right now have died. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. You know that, especially with ventilators and equipment and masks and shields.

We’re delivering life-saving therapies that have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And you don’t hear that from the fake news. Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher. And these are statistics that come from people that do this stuff, right? This is not done by my secretary. 24% higher than the United States and despite their punitive lockdowns, they’re once again seeing a spike.

They’re seeing a big spike in cases over there. They did the heavy lockdowns, just like you’re doing right here. And they’re seeing a spike. And there’s no reason for that. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. Think of that. And by far, the fastest recovery.

And if they wrote about it properly, it would be a proper thing, a proper thing to do. Through our historic relief programs, we’ve saved more than half a trillion Nevada cops and jobs and all of this yet. So many people going out. We’ve saved 42,000 Nevada businesses. Think of that.
 
Biden would terminate this comeback. He wants to end it. He would terminate this comeback. He would put your families in danger. He will totally destroy Social Security. And in my opinion, if you look at what he’s going to do to Medicare, they will destroy Social Security. They will. You called it. You know what you’re talking about? Exactly, right.

He’s going to massively raise your taxes. Reimpose crippling federal regulations, destroy your Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. He’s going to destroy that and decimate your 401ks and retirement savings and stocks. Your stocks are going to go down like you never saw anything go down before. He’ll obliterate your Second Amendment. He’ll give you… And he would, he would give free… He wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens that will bankrupt Medicare.

He wants to give… You saw him raise his hand. Remember the debate where they’re all standing there and he looked around, “Who’s going to give free healthcare to illegal aliens?” And everyone’s raising hands. He’s going, “Oh…” Now take a look. I’m not kidding. It’s sad. It’s pathetic.

He would end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates to terror-afflicted nations. You understand that. He’ll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal, illegal aliens. He loves sanctuary cities, meaning the people that control him love sanctuary cities.

Biden, pledges to oppose school choice. And he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are “gone”. They’re gone. In the second term, and we’ve already started it very heavily, I will provide school choice to every parent in America.

A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we’ve been through and we’ve been through more than any president has ever been through with these characters and they’re falling one after another. But you do notice that I hope. One after another. Oh, I see the phones have been wiped out. I wonder what that’s all about, but that’s a criminal thing you did. We are changing Washington. We are changing Washington.

Never forget that they’re coming after me because I am fighting for you. And it’s true. Over the next four years to conclude, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all.

We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies and a record prosperity, even greater than last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban sanctuary cities.

We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices, and believe… We will believe in enforcing the law. We want law and order. We have to have it. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. And we are bringing our troops home as we speak tonight. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.

We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed, starts on January 1st. I don’t want anyone to… I know ours is a big deal. I don’t want Sleepy Joe to take care of… Can you imagine? I’ll be watching. “Prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price…” And I’m the one that got it done.

And he’ll say, “What did I do? What did I do? How did this happen?” And we’ll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We just did favored nations. We’re going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause. You know what that is? We will… The drug companies don’t exactly like me too much. They’re spending millions of dollars on negative commercials.

Please understand when you see those commercials, it means your drug prices are coming down. We will strongly protect Medicaid and Social Security, which they will give up. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God We Trust.”

For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Nevada. So very importantly, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote on November 3rd.

From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno and from Clark County to right here in Douglas County, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty. They want to secure our liberty. Think of it and defend our freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers, tough people, great people who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, lit up the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip and transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis. So true.

Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And we are making it greater than it ever has been. We are making it greater than ever before. We are making it greater than it’s ever been. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country.

We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.

And together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much.

Thank you, thank you. Wow. Wow.
Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great to be with you. And a very special, hello, Nevada. Hello, Nevada. We love [ 00:00:53], and I’m thrilled to be here with you in Henderson. Thousands of loyal, hard-working, great American patriots. And 51 days from now, we’re going to win Nevada, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. And after we win four more years, we’ll ask for maybe another four or so.

Well, thank you very much. Whenever I say that … Look at all that news back there, look at all that fake news. When I say that, their heads explode. Our movement is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-police, and 100% pro-American.

As we begin tonight, our thoughts are with the two sheriff’s deputies in Los Angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range. Tonight, we send our love and our support to their families, and we pray to God for their recovery.

The radical left in America is waging open war on law enforcement. Hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs. You see it, you see it all the time. Please, sit down. Please, let’s have a little fun. We got plenty of time. I mean, here it is. I mean, what do we have? Football is boring as hell. It’s just not the same. Right? I don’t know.

Used to be people would say, “Hey, could you keep it away from a football game?” Now they’re saying, “Could you possibly do it during the football game?” We have some free time. But during violent demonstrations in Las Vegas, a 29-year-old police officer, you know this very well, was deliberately shot in the head, leaving the young, brave officer paralyzed, yet, Sleepy Joe Biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police. They’re putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm’s way. At his convention, he never even mentioned the words, “law and order”, never mentioned them once. Now, he’s all of a sudden, his polls are dropping like a rock, and he’s starting to say, “But we need law and order.”
And then he goes back into the basement for four days. What happens to this guy? I know what happens to him. He’s shot. That’s what happened to him. Every once in a while, the great Dana White … Does anybody know Dana White?
He’s got some champions with him tonight. He’s here. I got to introduce him. But every once in a while, I’ll ask him, “What happened to that guy?” He said, “Sir, he’s been shot for the last … long time.” Should have left a long time ago. That’s Joe Biden. Joe Biden, he’s shot, and everybody knows it. And you know what? They ought to be ashamed, because they do interviews with him, they give him the questions, and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter, and that’s the fake news.

It is. How about the other day? Could you move that a little bit closer. See these things? Move it a little bit. I must tell you at great peril, I used them seldom, but those are the times we have the best fun too, I will say. And that’s actually when we learn the most.

For the entire summer, Biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers. When Biden’s far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations, court houses, Joe Biden called them peaceful protestors. Right? They call them peaceful protestors. And when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems, because everyone … look at the top-10. You go back … go top-20, top-30. Take a look. Democrat-run, radical left-wing, Democrat, usually run. Not Republican-run, Democrat-run. And we go back, and we take a look. We want to give them help. They don’t want help.

But when they do ask for help, and when they do, we go in. Like Minneapolis, the National Guard went in, took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks. They knew we were going in to Seattle. We told them, “We’re going in tomorrow morning.” And so, they sent them in. They didn’t want that to happen, and we let the protestors know, or whatever you call them. They’re really anarchists, they’re not protestors.

So we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10,000 very tough people, and they immediately raised their hands, and the Seattle police, who by the way, could do a great job if they were let to do their job, but they’re not, they’re not.

And as you know, in Portland, the other day, we had to send in the US Marshalls. A man, who’s a bad guy, bad guy, shot somebody right in the middle of the street, who they say was a very fine young man. Shot him, killed him. Just shot him like … It was on television. Two-and-a-half days, nothing happened. I said, “What’s going on?” We sent in the US Marshalls. It was taken care of in 15 minutes. Okay? 15 minutes.
When asked if he would cut police funding, Sleepy Joe said, “Absolutely, yes, I would.” Now he’s trying to change his mind. You ever see a guy … He changed his mind on fracking. Okay? “There will be no fracking.” You know that? He went all throughout the debates. He doesn’t even know what fracking is, I guarantee you. He was told to say that by Bernie and the radical left and his vice president. By the way, how bad is she? She is the worst.

We’re going to have a woman president some day. Not going to be her, not going to be her. And that’s no way to attain the office. We got in there because Sleepy Joe couldn’t handle it anymore. Joe is bad primetime. See, the reason I can talk so badly about him, because he did an ad, where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago, and they said … And nobody loves the military more. Look what I’ve done for them, $2.5 trillion.

And in the ad, they have me saying horrible things in front of other people. Nobody would have put up with that. It’s called disinformation. They make up a total lie, they put it out, then they do ads. So once he did that, I said, “Now, really, look, it’s okay. It’s okay, because now the gloves are off.” I can say that this man is totally unfit to be president. Up here, he’s totally unfit. He can’t be your president.

I’ve gotten to know President Xi of China. I’ve gotten to know President Putin of Russia. And by the way, getting along with them is good. Although China, I must tell you, got a real problem with China. What they did with us, we can never forget that. We made a great trade deal. The ink wasn’t dry when the plague came in from China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop it from going into our country, Europe and the rest of the world. Okay? They could have done that.

But you see, I deal with all of these people, and they don’t have the kind of mental problem that Sleepy Joe has. They’re very sharp. Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un doesn’t know about the problems that Joe has. We need very sharp people. I’m sorry. Joe is not qualified for this position.

Joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons. He wants to close prisons, and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently. You saw that? The enemy, until his polls started dropping. Then all of a sudden, he said, “No, we love law enforcement.”
I think I’ve gotten every major law enforcement group in the country, right?

You saw recently, I got New York’s finest. And they are New York’s finest, but they’re not allowed to do their job. They’re not allowed. We have a radical left mayor who has no clue. He has no clue what’s happening to that poor city. I love that city. What’s happening to that city. 300% up. Look, 300% in certain very bad crimes, New York. There’s no reason for this, and we have the greatest police. They’re great. New York’s finest, they endorsed me.

Chicago, Fraternal Order of Police. Chicago endorsed me, Oklahoma endorsed me, Texas endorsed me, Florida endorsed me. Every place endorsed me. And if you think it’s easy for New York and Chicago and these different places … Ohio endorsed me. If you think it’s easy for these guys. They never endorse. New York, they said they cannot remember ever having endorsed a presidential candidate. They endorsed me, and they’re against their radical left culture that’s destroying the city. So I was very honored.

But how about Chicago? Do you think it’s easy for these great police in Chicago to endorse me? It’s not easy, but they felt that they had an obligation to do it. So it just happened. I’m just very honored by it. And Biden’s anti-police crusade must stop. It’s got to stop, it’s got to stop now.

Furthermore, the corporations, these poor, stupid people that run the … They got paid a lot of money. They’re weak, ineffective people, let’s face it. They’re funding anti-police organizations and other organizations that are … It’s so embarrassing. And I don’t mean for a little. They gave $100 million and 250 … You’re talking about serious money. You’re talking about serious money, and that money is not used for good reasons. And these stupid corporations … and they’ll be the first to go if the radical left ever took … They’d throw those guys out like they were nothing. If they were lucky, they’d just be thrown out. It would probably be a lot rougher than that.

These people don’t know what they’re getting into. But instead of giving money, they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers. That’s what they should do.

So in the Republican Party, we know that police officers are not villains, but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe. And they guard … The thing that’s incredible … I know so many police, they’re so good, one bad apple, and they’re on for months. One bad apple, they go on for months. The thousands and tens of thousands of good things, nobody talks about it. These are great people that have done a great job, and we have to support our law enforcement.

So Biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists, and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Okay? And we also believe that if you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty, and that’s something that’s very important.
And you saw a video of that animal that went up to the car. Did everybody see that? This animal goes up to the car. Two unsuspecting, fine people. There was [ 00:13:42] fine people. I mean, they’re in very grave condition, as you know. Fine people. He’s an animal, and I called him an animal, and I was criticized by people, calling him an animal. They said he’s a human being. He’s not a human being. He’s an animal. He’s not a human being. Joe Biden opposes the death penalty even for cops who … I mean, look, you have to see, even for these cop killers who go around, the predators, they murder children. People like the Boston bomber. He opposes the death penalty for the Boston bomber. He wants to give prisoners a vote. He wants to have the Boston bomber be able to vote. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I don’t think so.

You know who’s thought of that? Bernie Sanders, Crazy Bernie. He wants to have … Crazy Bernie, he says, “No, no, they have to vote.” So they asked him, “Well, does that mean every … ” That means everybody that’s in prisons should be entitled to a vote, right?

So they actually said, “Well, what about the Boston bomber? Should he entitled?” And Bernie goes, “Yeah, he should be entitled.” Bernie is crazy. But the fact is, that we got a lot of Bernie votes four years ago, because Bernie’s right about one thing, trade. Because all of these countries, friend and foe, they ripoff the United States.

We have made so many great trade deals, and you see it, USMCA. We got rid of NAFTA. So many. But Biden is too weak to be president, and he’s not a smart person. And by the way, he wasn’t smart 25 years ago. Everybody knew it. Now we don’t even have to discuss the matter. But I was going to say, when he put that ad up, we told him to take it down. When he put that ad up, that dishonored our fallen heroes. They are great, great heroes of mine, of yours, of everybody’s.

I know really bad people. No bad person, the worst person I know, I know some beauties from New York. I know some developers in New York actually. Nobody would say what they said. They made it up. It was a made up statement, and they put it up in the form an ad, from a third-rate magazine, who’s best friend is Obama, who, by the way, got caught spying on my campaign. He got caught. We caught him cold. We have him cold. Now let’s see what happens.
Now the Republicans, it’s interesting, we have much better policy, but the Republicans, they don’t fight like Colby. You know who Colby is. You’re going to say hello to Colby. They don’t fight like Colby. They don’t fight to win. Better policy, but they don’t have that vicious streak. If this were reversed, they would be in jail for two years already, and it would be for a 50-year term for treason. That’s what it would be. Okay? But Biden’s too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will. He’ll never have the strength, and he’s going downhill fast. It’s going to be very interesting.

And I called for a drug test, because you know what? I want a drug test, because we don’t want to have a situation like we could have with this guy. I watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics, and he was so bad. No, he was so bad. Maybe he’ll win because they don’t like me, they don’t like my personality. But I hate to say it, I’m what you need. I’m what you need.

But if Biden ever did win, he would surrender your country to the mob. You know that. And he will have nothing to do with it. It’s not him. I mean, he’s being … He’s going to be pushed around. And she’s, by the way, just so you know what you’re going to get. She’s considered far more liberal than Bernie Sanders. How about that? That’s what you’re going to have. I don’t think your state is into that. Unlike Biden, I’ll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And I’m deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements. That to me is a really big deal. That to me is really a big deal. And I just want to thank all of them, including the National Troopers Association and Coalition just came in. We also received the endorsement, total and complete endorsement from the Public Safety Alliance of Nevada, and the Las Vegas Police Protective Association from Nevada.
And I want to thank for that, Steve Grammar, who’s with us tonight. Where’s Steve? Was Steve here? Steve, thank you. Thank you. That’s a big deal. Make sure they get out and vote, Steve, because they’re playing around with the ballots. Okay? You know your governor.

So we had many sites, by the way, all exterior sites, all outside. Today, you’ll hear these phoneys back there. Well, look at that. Now today you’re going to hear them. They’ll say, “Oh, it was in …” Well, the reason it was, we had five sites, all outside sites, like last night. Tremendous room. And a great gentleman who owns this building said, “You know what? What they’re doing is really unfair. You can use my building, Don. I want to thank you, Don.”

I want to thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. Joe Biden has spent the last 47 years selling out America. Look at what he’s done. Everything he’s done was wrong. He always voted the wrong way. Even his secretary of defense, his secretary of state, they said he always voted the wrong way. He was off shoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military, and sacrificing your children’s future to China and other faraway lands.
I’ve spent the last four … He says … Only in Nevada can you have … I would never say it. What did you say?
Okay. This way I can’t get in trouble. I’ve spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military, and standing up to China like no other president has ever done. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins the rioters and anarchists, and …
Look, you see what’s going on. The arsonists and flag burners. How about the flag burning? I would love-
I would love to have a law … This is so sad what’s going on. When I see the American flag burn, I get so angry. I get so angry. I would love to have a law. It has to go through a big process. You burn the flag, you go to jail for one year. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it.
If I were a Congressman or Senator, I’d be in there with that one. You know, they’ll say, “Oh, freedom of speech.” That’s not freedom of speech. You burn the flag, you should go to jail for one year. I really mean that. They’ll say, “Oh, it’s horrible. He’s against free speech.” No, no, we’re not. We’re not against free speech.

But I’m running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in, and it’s happening very fast. And I’m running for your state. I love this state. You know, I put a lot of money in this state and it’s been a great investment. And we want to keep this state strong. Not for that reason, by the way, for other reasons, because this is a great place. You have a governor right now who’s a political hack.
We want to put violent criminals behind bars. And tell you governor to open up your state, by the way. Open up your state. You know, just so you know, these shutdowns, we did the right thing. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. They came in, they … We were all seeing what was happening. We closed up. I mean, you know, you’re presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say, “Sir, we have to close it.” And we did the right thing. We closed it.

Well, actually he didn’t think we should close it yet. But later on, he said, “We did the right thing.” We closed it. We closed it. We saved millions of lives. If we wouldn’t have closed it, we would’ve been talking two and a half or three million. We’re at 180. It’s far too much. But we would have been talking about … It would’ve been unacceptable, unsustainable. It would’ve been so bad. Think of it. We’re at 180,000. Other countries are doing terribly. Did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries? Us compared to Europe?

We have done an incredible job. We get absolutely no credit for the job we’ve done. And I don’t want it myself, but I want it for the admirals and the generals and Mike Pence. And Joe Biden was against it. Remember? He was totally against closing. He said, “Oh, he’s xenophobic.” I’m xenophobic? I wanted it closed and nobody else did. At that time, nobody else did. I was way early. You know, they say, “He didn’t act fast.” I was months early. Nancy Pelosi was a month and a half later saying, “Come to Chinatown. Let’s come to Chinatown.”

And Sleepy Joe was totally … He thought what I was doing was terrible. Then all of a sudden, now I see him saying, “He should have closed it earlier.” This guy … You know, the great thing about the age in which we live? It’s all down in tape. It’s all down. I got a reel on him. We call it Biden’s Best. You got to hear this.
But we want to ensure the future of America, not the future of China and other countries, because if we win, America wins, and it’s all about America first. You’ve had presidents, they never put America first. They didn’t put America first. They didn’t take care of our country, but we’re taking care of our country. Now, Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he really doesn’t believe, truly, in our country. But I think that’s a very strong statement. I don’t think he has a clue. I’ll be honest.

The people that push him around don’t believe in our country, because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy Bernie, right? It’s called the manifesto. You know why it’s called the manifesto? Because this is beyond socialism. This is a word that starts with a C, not and S. That’s where they’re coming from. That’s where they’re coming from.

At Biden’s convention they decried America wicked. And they were saying it’s wicked sinful. It’s destined for a fate of doom and despair. That was, by the way, that was the most depressing convention. We had a great convention. We had a great convention. They actually said that America wasn’t great. They actually said that America was never great.

You know who said that? Cuomo, the governor of New York, said America wasn’t great. I don’t know if he’s going to get away with that one. That’s going to haunt him. That’s going to haunt him. America wasn’t great. Him and his brother, Fredo. You ever watch Fredo? His ratings aren’t very good, so you probably don’t.

But we know the truth. America’s the most exceptional nation on Earth. And our destiny is blessed by God.
We love this nation with all of our heart and soul, and we will always take care of our nation. You know, we have a little expression, “Make America Great Again.” That’s what’s happened. And you know, we had it done. Now I say, “Make America Great Again, Again.” Comma. I go comma again. And that’s what we’re doing at a record clip. They’ve never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else. You see the numbers.

On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, and we’re doing it. We’re going to have a tremendous year next year. Or whether we’ll allow Joe Biden and the group of handlers to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, destroy our suburbs, demolish our second amendment, and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-American lie.
Yeah. Get him out of here, would you please?
Under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the world. He’s going home to mom. And now we’re doing it again. We’re developing a vaccine in record time. The other administration would have been years, and we’re almost there. It’s going to be announced very soon. We’ll be ready before the end of the year. And we will very easily defeat the China virus. That’s what’s happening. And we’re already making that turn. We’re making that round beautiful last turn, but it should have never happened.

China should have never let that happen. They should have stopped it in China. Under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in Nevada’s history. And we’ll soon be there again. You see what’s happening. A guy like Biden would totally eradicate Nevada’s economy. He would make it impossible for you to compete. And he’s already said if the doctor suggested, he would shut down the country again. We’re not shutting down our country.

A shutdown we’ll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of American. Look the Americans, you know, on the other side if you look at these shutdowns, and you’re living through it right now. You know, there aren’t many states that are shut down. They’re all Democrats. North Carolina, your state. But North Carolina, we’re not … You take a look at North Carolina. Pennsylvania shut down. Every one of them that are shut down are doing not well. They’re not doing well. And they all have Democrat governors. And you know, when you look at the suicide rates, when you look at all of the suicide, all of the domestic violence, the drugs, all of the problems, we can’t have it. We can’t have it. Open up your state. You got to open up your state. It’s all political. It’s all political. It’s all political.

On November 4th, they’ll announce, “We’re going to open up the states.” They’re only doing it to affect your November 3rd great election. Most important election. Biden will always do whatever the radical left demands. And if elected, his radical supporters won’t just be causing mayhem on the streets. They’ll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security. And by the way, the United States Supreme Court. And we will have a very different country. You know, the next president probably will have anywhere one, two, three, or four Supreme Court justices.

If you want your second amendment, if you want life, if you want so many other things, even having to do with your military, even having to do with your vets, if you want things, if you want, you’ve got to have the court. Because they’ll last for 25, 30, 40 years. They’re put on as young people and they stay a long time. Our country will never be the same. We’ll never be able to recover from it. So you got to get out on November 3rd or early voting. You got to get out and vote. And you could send your ballot, and then you have to check that your ballot’s counted because they might not count your ballot in this state. They may not count your ballot. But we’re looking to save and we’re going to save America. We’re not going to let that happen.

So we’re joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job they’ve done. You see it. I mean, you’ve seen it all the way. The job they’ve done in their campaign. They beat people that were very good, very talented, great politicians, and they won. Dan, where is he? Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. And we’re with you all the way, Dan. And Jim Marchant. Jim, thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. So we’re backing you all the way. You got to get them in.

We will take back the House. You know why? Because people cannot stand Nancy Pelosi. They don’t like Nancy Pelosi. Even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in. Can you believe that? Nancy Pelosi’s a customer. She turned her in. She thought it was disgraceful, but that’s what we’re dealing with, a bunch of phonies. But you guys, we have your back 100%. Michael, you’ll make sure, all right?

I also want to introduce and thank … He’s done a fantastic job. Nevada Republican Party Chairman, Michael McDonald. And a friend of mine, and thank you, Michael. Your former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. And a person with tremendous spirit and personality to put it mildly. She’s tough, but she’s very kind. She’s a great person, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you. Thank you, Kimberly.

The owner of the Chicago Cubs and he’s in first place, so he’s very happy, the RNC Finance Chairman, Todd Ricketts. Where is Todd? Todd, thank you. Great. Go win that pennant Todd. Win the pennant. One of the best people ever to work for me …

One of the best people ever to work for me in government. He’s tough, he’s smart, he can be vicious, but he’s just fair more than anything else. But he is a talented guy with tremendous energy and tremendous brain power, Rick Grenell. Thank you, Rick.
And here he is again, because they’re going to try and find out, “Man, what’s this guy manufacturing?” This is a manufacturing building. And outside, 25,000 to 30,000 people, everyone’s saying, “What the hell is he manufacturing?” Maybe he’s manufacturing Trump, I don’t know. He’s manufacturing something pretty good. Boy, they’re going to be giving you a lot, but again, Don, thank you very much, Don [ 00:00:54]. Thank you Don. Thank you Don. Also, a Las Vegas legend, Rick Harrison. Rick, thank you Rick. You are a legend, aren’t you, huh? Great job you’ve done. Great job you’ve done. A friend of mine for a long time. Years ago, he was looking for a place. Can I tell this story just quickly, do you mind?
He was looking for a place and they said, “Well, that sport’s never going to make it. It’s too violent.” They just don’t know how violent the American people are, do they? They never quite figured that out. “No.” They said, “No, it’ll never make it.” There’s nobody like this guy, I’m telling you. I always say it’s a great sport. Without him, I don’t know what they’d do. I don’t know if anything would make it… He could do anything. He is so smart, so tough, so cunning.

He’s been a friend of mine for a long time, I’ve been a friend of his, but I gave him a place a long time ago. And all I know is, just like we have outside, we had lines. I said, “What the hell is going on here, Dana? This place is packed. We were packed. We had thousands of people that couldn’t get in, and I was so nice. I said, “Let’s do it again, Dana, please.” And we did it again and again and again, and it became the UFC and he sold it and has a big chunk of it, but he got $4 billion when he sold it. $4 billion. That’s not too bad. That’s not too bad, Dana. But he really is, he’s an incredible guy. And he also loves his fighters. He wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along, the best. But I want to introduce Dana White. Dana, please stand up.

And Dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with. Because under those beautiful suits, there are a lot of muscles, a lot of power, a lot of genius for fighting and for other things, but a lot of genius under those suits. A few members of the UFC community. Here’s a man, he used to walk into that ring and he still does, and he’s as good as there is in the world. Number one in the world. You don’t want to pick a fight with him at a bar. Let’s say you’d had a fight and you happen to meet Colby Covington. You say, “What’s your name?” And he said, “My name’s Colby Covington.” And the first time I saw Colby Covington, he walks into the ring. Now he wasn’t fighting, but he walked in with that same hat that you’re wearing. It said, “Keep America great.” It says, Make…”
He doesn’t care. As long as it has Trump on in someplace, he doesn’t care. He doesn’t discriminate. But this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy, who’s now in big trouble for doing what he did. And then he walks in wearing the hat, “Keep America great.” And he wears the hat and he’s going like this because this was a big story. You remember what they did to that guy? Conservative reporter, not a fighter. He wasn’t a fighter. And it was 10 people against one. Now, if we had 10 people against that one, those 10 people would be in serious trouble. They said, “What the hell?” But I’d like to introduce Colby Covington. Great fighter. Great, great fighter. Incredible. He is a great fighter.

Three months ago, I saw him fight a guy. He looked like it would be impossible to beat. I never saw muscles. He had muscles on muscles on muscles. And Colby is a very fit guy and fantastic. But he didn’t look quite the same. It wasn’t even a contest. It went a few rounds. I couldn’t believe what you did. He took him apart so easily. It was like an easy day at the office. So you have to explain that to me someday, Colby, but we love you, man. You’re with us and where we are with you.

Another great, great champion. Another great champion, Henry Cejudo, one of the best in the world. And Henry, please stand, please. Now, you won the championship twice, right Henry? Twice. He won it twice. Don’t mess with him. Don’t mess with him. And his brother, Alonzo, is here. Alonzo Cruz. Thank you very much, Alonzo. Thank you. Thank you. And Alonzo doesn’t mess with Henry, he learned that a long time ago. So one of the best fighters in the world, and he’s got a tremendous fight coming up against, I guess the number one rated pound for pound fighter, Justin Gaethje. Please stand up, Justin. Justin Gaethje, thank you. And you feel good about that fight?
He said he’s going to knock him out. Well, we’re going to be watching. It’s right before the election, but I think I’m going to be watching, okay? I’ll be watching, you better believe it. That’s going to be an incredible fight. Good luck. Good luck, Justin. Great fighter. And also Ali Abdelaziz, right? Abdelaziz. Great guy. One of the best. Thank you very much. But these are great people that they have so many people at the UFC and they’ve been big fans of us. They love our country. They love our country. And we loved them and nobody like our Dana. Thank you Dana, very much. Great honor. Thank you, man.

Tonight, we’re also praying for everyone throughout the West affected by the devastating wildfires. We want really forest management, we want forest management… My administration is closely coordinating with the state and local leaders, with the governor and we thank the more than 28,000 firefighters and first responders courageously braving the danger and their life, and I’m going there tomorrow. I’ll be going to California tomorrow. We have meetings with FEMA and all of the different people. It’ll be amazing to see. It’s like the biggest we’ve ever had.

It’s crazy. It’s crazy what’s going on. Thousands and thousands and thousands of acres. It’s crazy. So we’re going to be there tomorrow. We’ll be with the governor. We’re also going to various other places. Washington also is in big trouble and Oregon. I spoke with the governor of Oregon and they’ve never had anything like it. And of course they also have a place called Portland and we will put that fire out. Just tell us to put it out, governor. That fire we’ll put out. That’s a much easier fire to put out. It would take us less than a half an hour.

We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by Joe Biden and all of the damage that him and his thought process has inflicted over a 47-year period. We passed record-setting tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts. We achieved American energy independence. Nobody thought it was possible. When Biden pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, which is very clean, and he wanted to ban fracking, we said, “No, we’re not doing that. For 47 years, Biden crushed the dreams of American workers to enrich foreign countries. That’s what happened.

Look, he says he’s going to change. He’s been there for 47 years and you know that he’s been there until three and a half years ago. So it’s not like, “Gee, he hasn’t done it for 20.” He was there recently. They didn’t do it. And you don’t change. And you always go back to the first statement. His first statement was anti- religion. His first statement was anti-fracking, anti-energy. His first statement was anti all of the things, but it was really anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment. He even put this whack job, he even put Beto O’Rourke, Beto.

They said, “Beto is Spanish.” I said, “How does the Beto go with the O’Rourke?” They said, “Well, he wanted the Spanish vote, so his father calls him Beto.” What’s that? Does that sound a little bit phony? Because we had a poll today and Hispanics are at 52% for Trump and forty-something for Biden. Never happened before. Never happened before. They’ve never seen that before. I love the Hispanics. But the Democrats champion, NAFTA, TPP, the horrible South Korea deal, South Korea deal… Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary, she said, “We will create 250,000 jobs.” I said all the time, “We will do this deal with South Korea, we will create 250,000,” and she was right, but they were created for South Korea not for us. We didn’t get anything. And we renegotiated it and he was there for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement in [Dolores 00:11:12]. Great deal for us. That’s a great deal.

By the way, our stock market is setting records, I hate to say, in the middle a pandemic. But hopefully, as we round that final turn on the pandemic, we’re setting records with the stock market. Your 401k’s are doing very well. Your stocks are doing very well. And you know what? If something would happen where he’d get in, and there’s a headwind, believe it or not, that stock market would be much higher, but there’s a headwind on the possibility, okay? Everything is a possibility. There’s a headwind. But I’ll tell you what, if he ever got in, you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before. Just remember it, just to remember it, because what they want to do is crazy, the Green New Deal, $100 trillion, the Green New Deal.

That’s more money than we could make in a thousand years, a hundred trillion dollars. “We don’t like that building. The windows are too big.” What do you do? “Rip it down and build a new one.” “All good. That sounds good.” I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And we’re building many auto plants, you know that, some here, but we’re building many auto plants in Michigan, many auto plants in Michigan. If we don’t win Michigan after all those auto plants, and I don’t know, but it’s been tough but we won it last time. And we’re showing a poll that just came out that we’re two points up in Michigan. That’s very good, that’s very good.

I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rapid theft of American jobs. Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. That’s what it is.
For the last four years, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic community, I’m fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes, low regulations on all Hispanic-owned small business, and they are great business people. And they understood that. They understood that, they understood it… And by the way, there’s nobody that knows our Southern border better than, I call them the Hispanics, I call them the Latino. I said, “What do you prefer?” It’s very interesting. Some say, “Call us Latino.” Others say, “Call us Hispanic.” Others say, “Call us whatever the hell you want. We love you, we love you.” But our Hispanic population knows our Southern border better than anybody else. And they don’t want criminals coming across. They want people to come across, but they want them to come across legally. And we have the strongest Southern border now that we’ve ever had.

The Democrats and Biden would be a disaster for Hispanic Americans. He’s pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor. They’re fighting him. He supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion. Extreme late-term. He would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses. He would hand over your jobs to China, and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists. The Democrat Party also continues to attack our incredible border agents, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic Americans. And they’re great. And I want to thank not only law enforcement, but a big part of law enforcement, the Border Patrol and the ICE agents, they’re incredible.

The ICE agents, Dana could sign some of them up, the ICE agents, they go into like a pack. They go at a pack. They go into a pack of MS-13 fighters. These are criminals and they do it like it’s routine. You don’t want that job. I don’t see any of the people, male or female sitting in this audience, that wants that job, ICE. They take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country. All around our country, our communities are protected by Hispanic American heroes in law enforcement, and they deserve unwavering gratitude. I want to just thank you all, I want to thank you all.

With us tonight are members of the National Border Patrol Council and they are great friends of us. I want to just thank them. The official union of our nation’s incredible border patrol agents. And you know what? They’re not supposed to do it, but they did it anyway, they endorsed me. I want to thank Brandon Judd, who’s here, and Art Del Cueto. Art. Where’s Brandon, where is my Brandon? Where is Brandon? Look at these guys. Look, they’re ready. They’re ready to fight.

Hey Brandon, Art, pick out your toughest guy, I want to see whether or not he can take Colby in a fight. Don’t do it. Thank you very much. Thanks fellas. We appreciate it very much. Thanks. Great job too. Great job. My administration has achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release. We stopped asylum fraud. We’ve deported 20,000 gang members and over half a million criminal aliens. We built over 320 miles, as of today, border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles every single week. We’re doing about 10 miles a week and we’ll be finished with the wall very shortly. And you think, “That was an easy one.” That was not an easy one. We were fought.

Two things, and I say it, two things that never get old. Remember the Democrats are saying, “A wall won’t work.” “Really? Tell me about it.” Wall works. That’s one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old-

… one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old, never, you know what they are? A wall and a wheel. A wall and a wheel. It’ll never get old. A wall. I see so many things and I see all these businesses, computers, you come up with a new chip, you come up with a new computer, you come up with a new laptop. Three weeks later, you buy it, three weeks later, it’s obsolete. But a wall will never be obsolete, and a wheel will never be obsolete. You come back in a thousand years, a wall and a wheel.

Thanks to our powerful new security measures, we’ve doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year, we’ve doubled. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. And I’ve accomplished more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. That’s true. That’s true. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. So good for Israel. So good that we did that. They paid $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. I think Dana White could have made a slightly better deal than that. You know what we got for it? Nothing. We got nothing. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. al-Baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world. And we’re talking over a 50 year period. Number one in the world, the mass murder of American troops and many other people throughout the world, Qasem Soleimani is dead. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we’ve achieved the two historic peace deals in the Middle East in just the last month, two, two. Over 75 years, they did two. We did two in a month. And many other countries are coming in, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with Israel. Nobody thought this was possible. In fact, you didn’t hear it because they don’t report this. They just don’t want to report it, but they nominated your President twice last week on two different subjects for a Nobel Prize. But the fake news media didn’t cover it, so that’s it. Biden got it. Remember… Well, okay. Remember when our great President, right? Barack Hussein Obama, he got it. Right?

Like immediately. And they said, “Why did you get it?” And he was unable to explain, do you remember? “Why did you get it?” Because it was like, he just became President, and they said, “We’re going to nominate Barack Hussein Obama for the Nobel Peace award, right? And what happened? And then Biden said, “What about me?” They said, “Who the hell is he? This guy, what the hell has he done?” But it’s true. Obama got it for no reason whatsoever. Rick, you know that? No reason whatsoever. Joe Biden brought you only endless wars, I’m bringing you peace and I’m bringing our troops back home. They’re all coming back.

Endless wars. Biden voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. When I banned China from coming in, highly infected, he said it was hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died just by that one move alone. When the-
Thank you. I agree, actually, but I don’t think I’m allowed to say it. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, we’re delivering life-saving therapies, we’ve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You don’t hear this. Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the US, and despite their very punitive lockdowns, they’re once again, seeing very large spikes in cases, unfortunately. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation and the fastest recovery by far. Who’s going to do well? And there’s a reason for it. Through our historic relief programs, we’ve saved more than half a million Nevada jobs and over 42,000 Nevada businesses, we’ve saved 42,000 of your businesses.

Biden would terminate this comeback and put your families in great danger. He would reimpose the federal regulations, destroy your Social Security, destroy [ 00:59:59]. And he’s looking at doing all of this stuff. He will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401k)s, your retirement system, your stocks, he’ll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens. He wants to cut your vet facilities in half, go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million Americans’ private healthcare plans, which they love. Biden pledges to oppose school choice, and he stated that if elected, charter schools are gone. And charter schools have been great.

In a second term, I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a limitless future for all Americans. It’s really a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is. It’s the American dream versus the American nightmare. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we’ve been through, we are changing Washington. So in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and again, Don, thank you very much, but in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and if the governor comes after you, which he shouldn’t be doing, I’ll be with you all the way. I’ll be with you all the way. Don’t worry about a thing.

Over the next four years, we’ll be making America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies, and record prosperity. We will expand Opportunity Zones, and we will continue cutting taxes and regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And we’ll be watching the ballots very closely also, by the way. And we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not in enforcing their own agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these endless ridiculous foreign wars, all coming back. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength, two and a half trillion dollars, have the strongest military we’ve ever had, beautiful brand new equipment. When I took it over, it was totally depleted, our military. We have the greatest equipment that any military has ever even conceived of, things that people have no idea what we have, and let’s keep it that way. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency already signed, further reduce health insurance premiums, and the cost of prescription drugs will be dropping like a rock very soon. The drug companies do not like me too much. It’s a favored nations clause I signed. We will strongly protect Medicare, and your Social Security will be totally secure. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was a shell of itself. It was closed, they had grass growing in the runways, grass growing in the runways. Now it’s the number one space center in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust, and we’re going to keep it that way. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for your state, Nevada. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and on November 3rd or sooner, get out and vote. From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno, from Minden to right here in Henderson, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our great freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis and inspired the world with the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip.

Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are going to make it greater than ever before. That’s what we’re doing. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are, you know the story, going to keep on working, going to keep on fighting, and going to, like these guys, keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, Colby? You hear that, Justin? Okay?

He’s fighting a tough customer, but I don’t know. I think maybe, I’m in Vegas, I’ll have to place… Is the President allowed to place a bet? I don’t know. They’ll say, “The President of the United States just placed two bets, Justin and Colby.” I don’t know. I don’t know, but they are great. That’d be easy money. Well, maybe not that easy. I don’t know if it’s that easy. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.",13/9/20

The fake news, they said that this is supposed to be a roundtable, but it looks like a rally, but it is a rally because we love each other. No, it is a roundtable and we’re here to really listen. We’re here to discuss the Latinos and the Hispanic Americans. I want to say you have a great Governor. He has been fantastic. Thank you. I love you, too. And we’re really doing well. The country is doing numbers that… You will see. Next year is going to be, you know, you had your greatest year ever, Doug, last year, the best year you ever had. Then we had to close it up. We had to stop and we saved millions of lives by doing it. We saved millions of lives. And then we restarted and now we’ve set all kinds of records and we’re setting records. And I think next year you’re going to have a fantastic year. It’s going to be great. We’re cutting taxes even further. And we’re going to have big growth. A lot of good things happening. But I’m thrilled to be back in Arizona with the… Thank you.

Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!

By the way, I just looked. I see Artie over here. You’ve done a great job. How’s Albert? Is he good? He’s a good guy. Good job, Artie. So it’s really great to be back.
We love you!

This is good. You know, this is what the polls are all saying too. As a Republican, Republicans don’t do as well as perhaps they should. And probably some shouldn’t do very well, but the polls came out and were leading sleepy Joe by a lot. And so it’s a great honor to be here.

But we’re here to discuss my administration’s unwavering devotion to Hispanic American communities, Hispanic Americans embody the American dream and they are great business people like this guy right here. They’re great business people. Great, great business people. I know that because I’ve had to compete with them. They’re not easy to compete with. I want to say that. Hispanic Americans strengthen our nation beyond description. You protect our nation as brave members of the military and as members of law enforcement, great, great members of law enforcement. You uplift the communities and promote our shared values of faith and family, community, hard work and patriotism. You’re an amazing group of people. And I love you and we’re taking care of you and I’m never letting you down. You’ll never let you down.

We’re glad to be joined by your fantastic Governor, Doug Ducey. He’s done a fantastic job. You’ve done a great job.
He really has. It’s been incredible. So, and thank you, Doug.
Also, thanks to Arizona Republican Chairwoman, Kelli Ward. How are we doing, Kelli, by the way?
Thanks, Kelli. Arizona State Representative T.J. Shope. Thank you very much. Thanks, T.J. Arizona Corporation Commissioner Leah Marquez Peterson. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sergeant Jimmy Chavez of the National Troopers Coalition. Sergeant, thank you. We have the law enforcement from all over the country. Just got Florida, all the sheriffs, all the law enforcement, Ohio, Texas, everywhere, New York. We got New York’s finest. They said they’ve never endorsed before, but they’re endorsing this year. That took a little courage, too, because they’re in very unfriendly territory politically. But New York did and we just got Chicago. Can you believe that? With that wonderful, wonderful mayor.

We also have a man that I have a lot of respect. I like baseball. I’ve always liked baseball and he’s done a fantastic job. Arte Moreno, the owner of the Los Angeles Angels. Doing a fantastic job. How is Albert Pujols doing? Good. I think he’s great. Huh? Good. And you have a Mike Trout. So is he as good as they say? They say he’s the best player. He said he’s better. He’s better. Right? But they say is the best player in baseball.
That’s great. That’s very good. Thanks, Arte. Congratulations on your success, too. Great job. Also with us are two wonderful Arizona Republican nominees for Congress, Tiffany Shedd and Brandon Martin. Thanks, Tiffany. Good luck. Good luck Thank you, Brendon. And you have my complete endorsement, you know that. Complete and total, as they say, complete and total, okay? And we’ll be out working with you. We’ll be helping you a lot. I hear both of you are doing really well. Very important. Doug is working hard on that. Thank you very much.

Joe Biden has spent 47 years selling out the Hispanic American community, sending your jobs to China, raising your taxes, surging regulations. I don’t know. He doesn’t sound too good to me. He’s coming up once every three, four days. I’ve been in every state. I’ve been in so many states the last few days. Yeah. Well you need a lot of energy to do this job properly. You can’t be sitting in your basement for four days and come out. No, and then he comes out and I like Delaware. I think Delaware is a good place, but you got to leave it on occasion, you know. I mean, he comes up.

And remember, they say that his home state is Pennsylvania. No, no, no. He left Pennsylvania when he was young. It’s not his fault. Hiss father left, okay, and his mother. They left, but they left Pennsylvania when he was very young. And we just had a great ruling. Doug and I were talking. Just literally minutes ago, a federal judge, a very prominent, a very respected federal judge came out and ruled that they can’t shut the state down any longer. It’s too much. They can’t do it. He said it was unconstitutional and it was a great ruling.

And we hope that’s going to happen in North Carolina. We hope that it’s going to happen in North Carolina. We hope it’s going to happen in Michigan too, because it’s just totally shut down. Well, you know what’s going to happen. On November 4th, they’ll open up everything. They’re just doing it. on November 4th, they’ll announce everything’s open now. You know, we were only kidding. The fact is that November 4th, you’re going to see it’s going to all open up. It’s going to all open up. It’s politics.

So if you know, and as Hispanic Americans, you know better than anybody, we implemented historic tax cuts and regulation cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And we built opportunity zones that have really benefited your state and a lot of other states. And it’s been great for everybody, really, African Americans. And if you look at the African American, what they’ve done and how that’s benefited them, was I was helped by Tim Scott of South Carolina. And he’s a fantastic Senator. And he came in the idea of the opportunity zone, but for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and really everybody, it’s been a tremendous success.

Before the China virus came in, we achieved the lowest Hispanic American unemployment rate ever recorded ever. Not even close. Over 600,000 Hispanic Americans were lifted out of poverty in that short period of time. That’s a record. All records, Hispanic American ownership, home ownership reached an all time high. And that includes Arte’s home. Okay? That includes the home. Okay. That must be a nice home. I want to see that home. But it’s the highest home ownership ever in the history of our country for Hispanic Americans. We built the greatest economy in history and now we’re doing it again. So it’s called make America great again. And I say, make America great again and again. Again and again.

And we added, as you’ve probably heard, we added 3.3 million jobs for Hispanic Americans in the last four months. That’s a record. So we’re coming back very, very strong. I call it the super V. In July, I launched the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative to improve access to education and economic development and opportunity for all Hispanic Americans. It’s been a very big success. We have great people on the board. And we have that Biden would, as you know, terminate this recovery because if a doctor said, “Let’s shut it down,” we have all these records. We have retail sales records, everything. He said he’d shut it down. Can’t shut it down. Peaceful protesters. Have you seen his peaceful protesters? These are not. They’ll rip down your community. Many of these are Hispanic, American, small businesses, stores, shops, and they rip them down and they call it peaceful protesting.

You see some of these reporters on television, they’re saying, “Yes, this has been a peaceful protest.” And over his shoulder, it’s a pretty famous clip. The entire city is burning down. And these are all Democrat mayors, super liberal usually, but Democrat mayors and governors. Republicans are doing very well. Republican cities and states are doing incredibly well. We’re at records. We have been at records. We will be at records and we don’t have anything like this. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. And we’ve sent the National Guard into Minneapolis and we ended it after a week and a half. They should have called it sooner. We would solve the problem in Portland in I say less than a half an hour. It would be solved. But they don’t want to call us. They don’t want to call us in.

Every place we’ve gone, we solve it immediately. Seattle is an example. They took over a piece of the city and we said, “What are you doing?” And we complained, complained. We said, “That’s okay. We have to go in because we’re supposed to wait. We’re going in. And we’re going in tomorrow.” And we informed them we’re going in. As soon as we did that, they had people go in and these wise guys gave up, those so-called protesters. They gave up. They’re anarchists. They’re not protesters. They’re agitators and they’re anarchists.

So, you see what happens with the anti-police rhetoric from that whole group of Democrats and their supporters. They’re endangering our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. Many, many of the law enforcement are Hispanic Americans, as you know. Biden is not a strong person, never was a strong person. In prime time he wasn’t any good. Let’s face it. And this is not prime time for him. This is not prime time. But he’ll surrender your entire country to the radical left. And that’s all they’re doing is using him. He has no clue.

So we will take this to a whole different level. What we’re doing is taking it to a whole different level. We don’t want to have a socialist country. Some of you came from parts of the world where it’s socialist or worse. You know, it’s called the C word, right? The C word. Because I think in many cases, these people are talking even beyond socialism and we’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to let the rule of law really just be ruled by the mob. We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it properly. We’re going to do it the way we’re doing it.

And again, remember the top 10 are all Democrat. And then you go into the top 25 and you take a look at that. It’s the same thing. It’s all a Democrat problem. Whether it’s New York, where crime is through the roof, it’s gone up in some cases, 150 to 300%, not even recognizable. Or Chicago. You take a look at Chicago, what’s happening. They had numbers that were just absolutely horrible. And I don’t even want to mention it, but so many people shot, so many people killed. Nobody’s ever heard of this. This is a Democrat runs the city. These are Democrats and they have no clue.

They have no cash bail. They get rid of bail. They get rid of all of the things that you need. The police are afraid to do anything. They don’t want to lose their pensions. They don’t want to lose their life. They don’t want to lose their family and their job and everything else that comes with it. And we have to give our great law enforcement people, we have to give them the respect that they deserve. And if we don’t do that, they can never do their job properly.
 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And just in closing up, I just say a few words more because it’s so important to me, and your community is so important to me. But many Hispanic Americans came here to pursue the American dream, right? We all want the America. I want the American dream. We all want the American dream. If you look at what they’re asking for, it’s like the American nightmare or whatever you want to call it. But we want the American dream, having left countries that did not have safe streets. Many of you or your family, your mothers, your fathers, they left countries that were very, very bad, very bad, a lot of problems. And if we let this go on, you’d have that.

And I often say, we’re not going to be another Venezuela. We love the people of Venezuela. We have tremendous support in Miami, from Venezuelans and Cubans. We’re not going to let that happen to our country. Nobody wants it. And you know who wants it least is Hispanic Americans. They want to see it less than anybody because they know about it more than anybody. And so we’re not going to let that happen.

Biden wants to take away your police. He wants to, I wouldn’t say defund in his case, but I will tell you some of his compatriots want to defund your police. Let’s face it. They want to defund your police. They want to take it away. I don’t know who’s going to do the job when they call up at night. You saw the commercial where you call up and they say, “Murder, I’m sorry. We won’t be here for 24 hours.” And then they say, “I’m sorry, rape. We won’t be here for about a week. We’ll call you back in a week.” And this is what you’ll end up with. We can’t do it. We have to treasure our law enforcement. We have to let them do what they’re good at.

Another thing I think that’s so important is that we’re defending religious liberty and Joe Biden will totally eliminate religious liberty. He’s going to take away your second amendment because he’s not going to be what I had to put up with in the last four years to defend your second amendment. But you have to have your second amendment. And they’re going to at least obliterate it. They’re going to at least obliterate it.

They’re going to abolish school choice. They’re going to abolish charter schools. And we’re going to put charter schools all over wherever we can. We have so many people doing so well, and school choice. And we’ve been very hard on school choice and we’ll get it very much achieved like we have. Nobody’s done as much as we’ve done in three and a half years. Nobody. No administration in their first three and a half years. I say it. I say this that I’ve achieved more for Hispanic Americans in 47 months than Joe Biden is achieved in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true. They don’t call him sleepy Joe for nothing, okay?

But a vote for Republicans this November’s a vote for the American dream. And that’s all I have to say. I just want to thank you very much, and I want to thank you very much. And I look forward to hearing from some of the folks at the table and some of these people that I know. I have great respect for all of you I’ve heard of in one way or another. I want to thank you all for being here. Really, it’s a great honor. And Arte, it’s an honor meeting you. And maybe we’ll start with our Governor, our great Governor. And Doug, please say a few words.
I want to say thank you for your support of Arizona families throughout the crisis that we’ve been through, whether it was personal protective equipment, surge ventilators for our Navajo Nation testing that we needed in places like South Phoenix and Maryvale. Whenever we needed it, your administration and you personally delivered. So we’re grateful for that.

You know, Doug is very aggressive. He called me up. He called me up once he said, “We really need ventilators badly.” That’s hard. You know, because it’s like they’re big, expensive, very complex, I mean, from a tech standpoint, a high tech standpoint, they have to be perfect. They’re very hard and people don’t have them. Countries don’t have them. And now we’ve become the king. We’re making them like you wouldn’t believe. What did I say? I said, “How many do you need?” “Could you send us a thousand?” I sent a thousand. That’s a lot. But we got them to you. Did we get them to you?
A lot of ventilators.

Before this pandemic and after this pandemic, our economy has been booming in the state of Arizona. This has been the fastest growing state in the nation.

Thank you guys very much.
And the relationship with Mexico has been really great. I’ll tell you they have a very good president and we’ve gotten along very well and they’ve actually been very good. We’ve had a real relationship. NAFTA was a disaster for our country and now we have the USMCA, which is Mexico-Canada, and it’s been a great… And we’re not going to lose our businesses now to Mexico and Canada, they’re going to stay right here. So they have a very big economic penalty if they want to play the games of leaving. I mean we lost 55,000 firms went down to different, I mean, different places, but a lot of them went to Mexico, a lot of them went to Canada. There’s a very, very big disincentive to doing that. Well, I’d like to hear, as a baseball fan I’d like to hear from Arte, because he really has done, that team has been glamorized and it’s a great team and great players, great individual players. And let me know about the team a little bit and how you’re doing and let’s hear it. Come on. That’s a beautiful thing to own.
Well, now I really like that team. I liked it before. I didn’t know he was going to do that, but I tell you what, I appreciate it. And your story is an amazing story, it’s a great story. Think of that. And he’s one of the most respected people in sports and in business. And just a great story. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you
That’s great.
Oh, that’s very good.
And it is getting a lot easier to be Republican for as you say, minority. It’s getting a lot easier, whether you’re Hispanic or anything else. It’s a beautiful thing to see what’s happening with the Republican Party. And remember it’s the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. The other side likes to try and claim him, big disinformation, but they can’t get away with that one so, hey, thank you very much. It’s great. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.


That’s really nice. Thank you. Beautiful. Say hello to your wife, please. That’s really nice. I appreciate it. We have made a lot of strides with the opioid and the drugs, but you get set back with this China virus was a big setback, but now we’re back to business, but we did get set back with this horrible thing that was sent. It could have been stopped. It should have been stopped. It should have been stopped. They stopped it going into their country, but not coming into our country, not coming into Europe and the rest of the world. But I appreciate, those are beautiful words. Thank you very much. Please, go ahead.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Great job. Great job, thank you. School choice, absolutely right. Thank you. Please.
That’s great, thank you. It’s really nice, thank you very much. That’s a nice looking good too. Nice looking. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Great. Well, I just want to finish by saying my people told me this was going to take about one-third of the time, but after these stories started going, I wasn’t leaving. I want to tell you, they are incredible stories, success stories, all success stories. You’ve done so well. The Hispanic community is amazing. I knew that from many years ago, long before I thought about doing this whole deal in politics. I didn’t have to be told about the Hispanic community. I dealt with them. Natural business people, great business people. Great, great business people. You have to be very sharp when you deal with Hispanic Americans, or my Latinos. I love the Latinos, but I’ve always known how great you were. And a great example of it, one of your great examples of it. But it’s a fantastic community. I will never let you down. I will tell you, I’ll never let you down. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Artie, thank you very much. ",14/9/20

Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. That is a beautiful site right behind me, isn’t it? That’s a beautiful site. Thank you very much. And a very big hello, Wisconsin, we’ve been very good together. And I’m thrilled to be with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. 47 days from now, we’re going to win Wisconsin and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I feel that way so strongly, so do you. Joe Biden devoted his entire career to offshoring Wisconsin jobs, outsourcing your factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your children’s future to China. You know what he’s been doing? I just see he’s up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper. They don’t ask me questions like that. And the audience isn’t quite like this. Do you see what his audience … they’ve got cars. They have car in a parking, it’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen.

And CNN is going, “Oh, this is so beautiful.” It’s not beautiful. They have cars in a parking lot. What a deal, I’ll tell you, what a deal. Biden’s supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century, including a NAFTA, China. You take a look at China’s entry into the World Trade Organization and TPP. He supported them all, Biden, surrendered your jobs to China and you know that. I probably wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for that, it was one of the big things, one of the big reasons I decided to say to my great wife, our first lady, let’s go have some fun. Let’s go have some fun. She’s done a great job and very popular. And the family is all over the place, all over the country. But unlike Joe, who lets you down when he’d never even came back to Milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects, I came to Wisconsin and I’ve been here a lot since, since we started this, a lot.

And you’ve been a tremendous beneficiary of what I’ve done and I have to, because you’ve been with me, you’ve supported me and we’ve had great victories together, all victories, so I want to thank you. Now Biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob. You see what’s happening. If Biden wins very simple, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchists, arsonists, and flag burners, they win and we’re not into flag burners. We don’t like flag burners. I’d like to say, pass a law, one year in jail, you started burning flags, we put you in jail for a year. We should do that. They would have done that, it’s a different world, I guess, but it’s sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because we’re for law and order.

They say, don’t use that term, it’s too tough. No, everybody wants law and order. Minorities want law and order. Everybody wants law and order. They have to have it. I’m running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and that’s a continuation. Because I don’t know if you know it, the single greatest year Wisconsin has ever had was last year. The second best year that Wisconsin has ever had was the year before. And guess what the third was the year before that? And you’re going to have your best year economically next year, it’s all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by China. We want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, not to other very terrible forces out there, because if we win, very simply America wins. And that’s what we want, we want this great country to win.

Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders. Fixed the disastrous trade deals, they have been the worst ever. Not even … it was not even … when I looked at these, I studied them and I used to talk about them, they had to be bad. When I started studying, I said, “Who are the people that made these deals?”2 Grossly incompetent people. Brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S. military and obliterated the ISIS caliphate. We open obliterated it. Obama was not able to do it, he wasn’t able to come close. It was just announced that in 2019, before the virus came in from China, we grew median income by a record of $4,400 in just one year, achieving the highest median income in U.S. history. That’s in the history of our country.

In the first three years, we lifted six point six million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country. That’s not bad. And I didn’t even make these numbers up. These are numbers that … they sound good to me. We built the greatest economy in the history of a world. This is the greatest economy in the history of the world. And then the virus came in, we closed it down, we saved millions and millions of lives. We’d be at two and a half million, two million, three million. A number that would not be sustainable, would not be acceptable. A horrible number, there shouldn’t have been one person that died. It should have been stopped at China. They stopped it for their country, but it came out to us, to Europe, to the rest of the world, 188 countries. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year. And it could be very, very soon. You’ve been seeing what’s going … could be very, very soon. Could be, it’s amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine.

When they thought it couldn’t be done, they said, “Well, he’s got to get a vaccine.” And then all of a sudden, they’re looking like it’s going to be very close. We’re doing great. We’re doing great with vaccines and therapeutics, Remdesivir, all sorts of other things that are bringing the rates down, like at numbers that nobody can believe. But we have three vaccines right now, they’re in the final stage, clinical trials. We worked it for the FDA where they approved it fast. They went very fast, very quick, at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved. No other administration, certainly the last one, because the last one was grossly incompetent. In fact, that’s why I’m here, because if it was good, I wouldn’t have run.

If they did their job, I wouldn’t have run. I was very happy in my other life. I was very happy, but I’m very happy in this life. More happy, because nobody has produced in three and a half years, the first three and a half years, nobody has done what we have been able to do, nobody. So we’ll defeat the virus and next year will be truly, I think, from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints, maybe the best year of all. Hard to believe we’re going so fast, the numbers have been incredible. We’ve had employment numbers, the best ever. We’ve had retail sales numbers the best ever. You see them all, they come out every day. And our stock market is for the most part, at a new high.

And if people have 401ks, if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels, I think you should vote for sleepy Joe, because he’s going to raise your interest. He’ll be raising your interest rates. I watch him though, he’s denying all this up. Everything that he said, he’s now denying. He said, no fracking, right? There will be no fracking during the … he didn’t know what fracking was, but he said there’s no fracking. The reason is because everybody else, all of the radical left candidates up there, they couldn’t get too far left, so Joe agreed. Then he gets the nomination, now they’re all angry. You know that crazy Bernie, all of the left democrats, they don’t want to vote for him anymore because he made promises and now all of a sudden he forgot that he said no fracking. He said, “Well, now we can do some fracking.”

But remember this in politics, it’s always the thing that they say first, that’s what they’re going to do. No guns, no religion, no energy, no oil, remember that. Remember, he put Beto in charge of his gun policy, right? Beto, crazy Beto. Remember when Beto went out, he said, “I was born for this.” And that’s when it all came down. As soon as I heard that, anybody said they were born for this, that doesn’t play well. But he’s in charge of the Second Amendment. And you won’t have a Second Amendment. Frankly, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment if I didn’t get elected, it would have been obliterated. It would have been torn up. Maybe it would have been totally knocked out. But there’s tremendous pressure on your Second Amendment. As long as I’m here, you’ll always have a Second Amendment. But I want to just say, they do disinformation, they make up a phony story and then they go with it. They make up a totally phony story. It’s called disinformation. And one of the things, oh, what they did, the worst of all was the soldiers. Because, nobody loves our soldiers like I do and they made up a phony deal. And that’s why I say the gloves are off because when they do that, that’s worse than what I’m going to talk to you about, that’s big 10. You know we got it back, right? We got big 10. But the soldier story, about standing over their graves, you know the one I’m talking about, then they do a commercial. And I said, the good news about that is the gloves are off. I can now call him grossly incompetent, the man is incompetent. He’s been there for 47 years, he didn’t do a thing.

Now all of a sudden, in years where he was never considered smart, but now he’s really not considered smart. And now all of a sudden he’s going to do what he never did in 47 years. He’s got to do this and that and everything that I’m doing, everything that we’re doing. But I want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday’s announcement that the fall season will start very soon. Oh, I hope your team does well after all that. I hope that team does well. But I especially want to thank a football legend, he was great. Wisconsin’s own Barry Alvarez, he was great. Good, got to be careful when you do that, a lot of times you don’t like people too much. They say, “Oh,” but he’s a good man. We worked with him. We worked with a whole group, including the commissioner of the league, did a very, very good job, did a very good job.

But we called them, and the reason is that they took an ad. In other words, another one, disinformation. They took an ad saying I was against football. I’m the one that said they shouldn’t close. But I said that, if they close, they close. But then they took an ad saying I’m the one, I didn’t want it. I wanted it closed. So then I said, “Well, no, I don’t. I want it open. Let me call up the commissioner.” We called up the commissioner and he was great. He said, “You really think so?” And bottom line, we worked very hard, lots of calls to lots of different states, lots of people. We dealt with the players, the parents of the players, who are really the boss, that’s okay, I won’t say that. But these are players that have a shot at the NFL. They have a shot at pro-football. We want the NFL to proudly stand when they sing our National Anthem. Or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend, down 27%. Because people don’t want that.

You know what, we have enough politics, right? We have politics here. We have politics all over. In fact, sometimes I have to turn it off. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t watch me. It’s always … I can’t watch me. I can’t watch. But no, we have enough politics. We don’t want to watch now on Sunday, all, here we go again with the politics, let them play football, let them stand and salute or put your hand on your heart and be proud of our country and be proud of our great American flag. And then go home to the mansion and have a good time. Take a nice sauna and then if you want, after you recover, you come out and you go and you do your thing, whatever the thing may be. But people don’t want to see it and the ratings are down. Here we go again.

I thought we taught them that lesson two years ago. Didn’t we think? I thought we taught that lesson. But Biden would absolutely eradicate your state’s economy. I know this state very well. It’s one of the reasons I made the great deal with Canada and Mexico, but Canada, because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products. You had a 287% tariff on your dairy products with Canada. People don’t realize Canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until I came along, very, very unfairly. Did you know that? 287. But I saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. They had something called specialty milk. Does anybody know what that is? Right, you know. A lot of people … it’s a small little grouping of milks, specialty milk. But this was the final straw.

And I met some people and Canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else. And they raised a tariffs massively, they made it impossible. They tried to take over that business too, along with all of them, it was just massive and horrible what they did. And that really got me going, the little specialty milk, specialty products, a small portion, but you know what, that was it. And we have a great deal. The USMCA is a great deal and I’m very honored to have done it. But it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by Canada. You know, they have the wonderful, Oh, Canada, we love to hear the song, right? But let me tell you, they are very tough. And they’ve taken advantage of our country for many, many years. And I will tell you this, they’re not so happy now, but at least they got a deal, but you’re happy. And it’s about time you were happy. You now have a great deal and you’re not going to have your companies leaving for Mexico anymore or Canada.

And you’re not going to have them make your product in Mexico or Canada, send it over here with no tariff, with no tax. Where we lose tax, we lose jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. And they make a lot of money selling the product to us, same product. So we’re not doing that stuff anymore. There’s a tremendous disincentive, it’s called, like, let’s not do it. And you haven’t seen that lately. You haven’t seen too many companies leaving have you? It’s sort of an amazing thing. It’s a little bit like what we did with the statues. So on the statutes, they were knocking them down three or four months ago. I said, “Do we have any laws? No, but there was a very old law.” I said, “What was it?” You get 10 years in jail, 10 years in prison, they actually use the word prison, which is a tough word. You get 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or a monument. I said, “Let me see that law, I want to see that law.” Right, Glen, right? I want to see that law.

Where’s Duffy, is he there too? Look at the guy, he’s climbing trees tomorrow. And Rachel, oh Rachel, he was a good climber, you think he could climb up a tree faster than me? I think so. So I just want to tell you, so what we’ve done in a very, very short period of time is what nobody thought. And we came in and we did it and we did it for you. And we did it for everybody. We did it for our country, but we wouldn’t have a country left. What was happening to our country, how we were taken advantage. Now we have to get four more years to cement it and to do additional things, including tax cuts. They’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your taxes very substantially. We’re cutting your taxes. We got you the biggest tax cut in history, and we’re going down lower and it’s called. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. So big tax cuts, big regulation cuts. The Democrats, they want to … the Democrats, they want to just really break us down in terms of our competitive ability to compete with other nations. Do you notice what’s happening with Japan? You notice what’s … We have taken billions and billions of dollars in from China. We charge them a fortune. In fact, many farmers in this group, because you got to love Trump. I gave you $28 billion, right? Thank you very much, China, right? You were targeted. 12 billion, Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. I said, “Sonny, how much have they been hit for, targeted for?” Remember when China said we’re not going to do anything, we’re not buying. They thought they were going to put pressure on us. Sonny said, “Sir, 12 billion, the year before last and last year was 16, total of 28 billion.” We took 28 billion out of the tariffs. China never paid us 25 cents, not 25 cents with Obama and Biden.

And in all fairness with no president, they paid us nothing. They pay us now tens of billions of dollars. I took a small portion of it, I added it up, 16 and 12, 28, and I said, $28 billion is going to the farmers. Did everybody get that money, right? You had a very good year, the farmers have had a very good year. Last week, China ordered and you have to understand, I view China differently now than I did six months ago, we made a great trade deal but I view it differently because I don’t know if I can ever view it the same. But last week they know how I feel and they’re very smart. So instead of saying, we’re not going to do business, which would have been okay with me. We would have worked it out somehow, you would have been very successful, the farmers.

But last week, they had the largest order of corn. Did you know this? In the history of our country. Did anyone know this, the farmers? From China, thank you very much. The largest order of soybeans in the history of our country. And one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country, because they’re very smart. Somebody else would have said, well, let’s not do business. And then it would have been easy for me, but they gave us so much. I have every farmer calling up saying, please do me a favor. We love this. We love this. This is a great deal. It’s a great deal, but we feel differently about it, don’t we? We just feel differently about it. I don’t talk about it like I used to, I talked about it, it was great. And it turned out to be a great deal, but I don’t talk about it the same way.

At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties, you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other. On November 3rd, Wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow Biden and the Democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, which is what they want to do. Shut down the economy, destroy the suburbs. You know they were destroying our suburbs, you know that, right? I don’t know, if somebody said, you just doing okay in the suburbs? I said, “How can I do okay, I saved the suburbs. What I’ve done is saved the suburbs.” And you know this, I don’t have to go into it, but I saved the suburbs. I think the suburbs … Last time, four years ago, “Oh, he’s not going to do well with women.” I did great with women. They said, “Well a big thing.” Remember that?

Election eve, “He won’t do well … this will be a very short, not doing well with women.” I did great. They said at the end of the night, after they announced I won, they said, “What happened? Well, he did very well with women. I don’t know how it happened there.” They said he did very well with African American community. He did very well with Hispanics. They said he did very well with everything. We kicked their ass. That was [ 00:24:40]. No, but was that one of the greatest evenings ever, remember? And remember all the fake news, look at all the … Oh la, that’s a lot. That’s a lot of people back there. Look at that, the red lights are on. Don’t worry, I won’t say anything bad about you CNN. Because as soon as I see, as soon as I-

Because as soon as I see … As soon as I’m getting ready to say something about fake news, et cetera, et cetera, the lights start going off so I’m not going to … One just went off I think. You can tell by the lights, they got that little beautiful red light. You see it? But I won’t say anything bad about them but they are fakers and do you remember when they … Remember when they were saying that the polls are terrible. Actually these polls are very good compared … That was so bad it was like why did anybody vote. They’re called suppression polls. They make them so bad that you lose all your appetite, you lose all your spirit, they take your guts out, and you don’t go and vote, and your wife looks at you and says, “Darling I love that guy, but he’s not going to win. He doesn’t have a chance because the polls, he’s down 10, he’s down 20, he’s down 50 points, darling. He can’t possibly win. Let’s go have dinner and then we’ll come home and watch his concession speech.” But my people didn’t buy that because my people went out to vote. Instead, we watched her concession speech. Crooked Hillary, that was a real piece of work. Remember when she was saying, “Will you accept the decision of the voters? Will you accept that decision?” I wasn’t perfect, I said I’ll see how it works out. I should have said, “Yes, I will,” but I couldn’t do that because I know how crooked she is. Would you accept the decision? The anchor said to me like, “Will you accept?” They’re coming after me, I said, “You’re supposed to be going after her a little bit too.” Did you ever see debates where you had all of the anchors plus the candidates against me? Here we sit, is that Air Force One, yes, that’s Air Force One. How did that happen? A lot of the times I’d say to the anchor, I’d say, “Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This isn’t fair.” I mean I’m watching what they’re doing with Biden where he’s using teleprompters, “Move it up, move it up, I can’t see, I can’t see.” He’s shot. He’s shot.

President Xi of China is not shot. Putin is not shot. Kim Jong-un, remember we’re supposed to be in a war with him, what happened to the war? No, it seems to be good. Did you see the Middle East two days ago? Remember our incompetent negotiator John Kerry? He never got up to walk. The guy’s getting beaten on every point, I say, “Walk. Walk. Get up and leave the table. You’re giving up.” They’d say, “We want this.” He’d say, “Well, I’d rather not.” “We want this.” “Okay, you got it.” “We want that.” “You got it.” “We want that.” Say no and walk. They’ll probably possibly call you back and if they don’t that’s okay too. But right now I will tell you Iran, if we win, Iran will be calling us within the first week, they’re dying to make a deal. GDP down 27%. They don’t have too much money for terror anymore, it’s actually amazing, do you notice what’s going on?

Now I don’t want to speak too loud, but I did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way, any form, written instructions already done, we’re going to hit them 1000 times harder than we’ve ever hit them before. So hopefully they will just come and we’ll make a deal and they’ll go back to being a rich country, let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. They cannot. That deal was so bad that Obama made. $150 billion, they got $150 billion for nothing. You know the deal is practically … If I didn’t terminate it which I’m proud to have done, but if I didn’t terminate it, they got $1.8 billion in cash, how about that? If I didn’t terminate that stupid deal, first of all you wouldn’t have the deal in the Middle East and all these countries are joining, it’s happening fast. They want to all join. We did it, you know, the reverse. We did it the … Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
You know it’s interesting, thank you very much. I knew I like you. So the Nobel Peace Prize. So the funny thing, a lot of people don’t know because the fake news doesn’t write about it. So if you’re a president, right? And you are nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, you’re the United States, no, but think of this. That’s a big deal. I mean Obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him, remember? He couldn’t tell you why. He had no idea. To this day, he has no idea why he got it. But if you’re a president and you get nominated, then two days later, you get nominated, did you know this, a second time, for a different deal. Kosovo. Serbia. They’ve been killing each other for hundreds of years. I stopped a lot of death and I did it like easy, it wasn’t hard for me. It’s sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing. But you know what? They did a check. So I got nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, that’s a big deal, I don’t know. I should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things, but these are for two different deals, and not one mention was made on the evening news. Think of it.

Now when Obama got it, it was headlines, headlines. Our president just got the Nobel Peace Prize, he was just nominated, headlines. Like his first little while he got it and to this day, and frankly, he did a lousy job. He was a lousy president, he really was. His vice president, I’ll tell you what. His vice president was very good for you know who? For Hunter, where’s Hunter, where’s? Remember the quid pro quo, remember, I’m not giving them that billion dollars unless you get rid of that prosecutor [ 00:31:42] I got rid of the prosecutor, here’s the billion, right? But they don’t want to play that too often. You have to look around for it. It’s a very unfair deal but as the expression goes, we won, I don’t know how the hell we did it. When you look at the opposition, when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well, you look at how unfair it is, it’s pretty damn good, but we have a lot of support. We have tremendous support of the people. These rallies, look at this rally. These rallies … These rallies are incredible.

I will tell you, Sean [ 00:32:19] gap ever polled. I’m not a believer in the polls but I believe that one. It’s the biggest enthusiasm gap, he’s got no enthusiasm. The only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us, they want to beat me. That’s the only thing he’s got, the people that want to … They couldn’t care less about him. He could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground. Biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids’ classroom. Earlier today I took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to America’s youth, the parents know all about it.

I checked, they’re doing it in Wisconsin too. I was a little surprised, I’m a little surprised. I’m a little surprised you let it happen actually but we’re going to get rid of it. I announced that we’re launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We’re going to teach our children the truth about America, that we’re the most exceptional nation ever to exist and we’re getting better every single day. Sleepy Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left. He even opposed sending the National Guard into a place called Kenosha, did you ever hear of Kenosha? How about that, did we do a good job? I wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governor’s okay. We have to do that if … We got to get the governors to say please do it. How they don’t do it, how they don’t do it in some other places when you look at what’s going on with Chicago, right? When you look at what’s going on with Portland, those are just anarchists. You know how long it would take us to fix up Portland in terms of ending it all? I’d say far less than an hour, I’d say a half hour.

Look what we did at Minneapolis. We’re doing well in Minnesota because they saw what happened. Now they shouldn’t have allowed it to go on for 11 days, they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night? Nice evening, a little problem, there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said, “No, this is a peaceful protest.”

By the way, officially, this is called a protest, you know that. We no longer call it rallies. We don’t use the term rally, okay? Rachel knows. We don’t call them rallies anymore because you’re not allowed to have a political rally for more than 10 people. You’re not allowed to go to church, you’re not allowed to meet, you’re not allowed to talk to anybody, you have to stay in a prison. Your home has become your prison and then I’m saying, “Well what are you allowed to do?” “Sir, you’re not allowed to do anything. I mean there is one thing but it doesn’t pertain to you.” “What is it?” “Well you are allowed to protest.” “Oh really? Oh.” Hence the name. We call them friendly protests. So these are protests, so it’s totally allowed. This is a protest. Remember when they walk out, when you walk outside, what do you consider this? Did you enjoy the rally? No, really, this is a protest, I’m sorry. No, [ 00:35:58] I don’t know if it’s your state but a couple of them they have …

You’re allowed to protest, so you can’t go to church but you can rip the hell out of the streets, of Main Street, of 5th Avenue, break up the stores. Burn down the buildings. Climb over each other’s face, you can climb right over their face. You don’t have to wear masks, you don’t have to do anything. 25,000 people walking down the street, looters, anarchists, agitators, burning down stores, throwing things at police. They’ve taken the authority away from our police, our great police. They’ve taken their authority and their dignity away. We’re giving it back, we have to, we have to.

By the way, I was endorsed by New York’s finest and we’re with them all the way. I was just endorsed two days ago by Chicago Police. I think that takes courage, right? Philadelphia, Florida, Texas, everybody, Ohio. I don’t know, did anybody … Is there one group of … Even if it was a tiny little group of two or three police, did anybody endorse Sleepy Joe? I don’t think so. But we did a great job in Kenosha. We got out there, I went there as you know, a little while ago but had we not gone in that place would … It would have been burned to the ground. They did damage, we should have gone in. I wanted to go in the first night, we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in Minnesota. Again, if they would have called us early it would have been over. Portland, I’d love to go there. That would be so easy. You know in Seattle, they heard we were coming in, they gave up. They heard we … I said, “That’s enough. We’re going in. I don’t care. We’re going in.” “Do you have permission.” “No, we’re going in.” They took over a chunk of the city, and when they heard we were going in it’s like, “Well we give up, that’s it.” That was the end of the Settle problem. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on.

All in Democratic run, super liberal run, cities. The red cities are doing great. I think we’re doing great all over, the Republican cities, we’re fair. We’re not stupid. How stupid these people are. Did you see Chicago? 48 people shot, six died. You know we’re in Afghanistan, we’re pulling the troops, you know that, we’re coming back, we’re almost finished. We’re pulling … Finally, these endless wars. These endless wars, and we had to fight other things but we’ve done a great job but we’re acting like a police force over there. No, we’re pulling the troops, we’re almost out of Iraq. That’s another one, we’re down to about 2,000 troops, did you know that Sean? 2,000 troops. So Syria, we’re out but we kept the oil so we have some … Was it okay that we at least kept the oil? I feel badly because we have some troops … “Well you haven’t pulled the troops.”

No no, we’re gone, we pulled all the troops out of Syria. Remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between Syria and Turkey? I said, “Why are we doing that?” They said, “Well, we are.” I said, “Wait a minute, we have an army of 100,000 here, an army of 25,000, 30,000 here. We got 5,000 soldiers. That’s a very dangerous position to be in.” I don’t like it. They’ve been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years. Why the hell do we have to be over there guarding their border? We want to guard our own borders, right, where we’re doing very well. Where we’re doing very well. We’re doing great on our southern border, I hate to say this, but that wall is going up very rapidly, 10 miles a week. We’re up to 330 miles and the wall will be finished very soon. You think that was easy, that was not easy, our great congressman over here, that was not easy. The Democrats were totally in favor of the wall until I said when I came in, “We will build the wall.”

As soon as I said it, they were against the wall. They said, “We don’t want you to build the wall. Walls don’t work.” I said, “No no, walls always work.” You know what else works? The wheel. The wheel and the wall, you can go back. Come back in 1,000 years from now. The only two things I know for sure, you’re going to have a wheel and you’re going to have a wall. The computers, they come up with a brand new computer, it’s genius, 12 days later, it’s obsolete. But walls are never obsolete, neither are wheels.

So I made one mistake and I tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me, the congressmen. They were incredible actually. I tell it to them. I should have said instead of we will build the wall, we will build the wall, we will build … Then the Democrats held us up and fought us and sued us and everything else and now we won so many lawsuits on the wall and we had the military money, I can build like 10 walls with all the money we have. It’s the craziest thing. Maybe we’ll build it double thick or we’ll go twice as high. No, but the wall is great. Everything, everything, that they wanted, but I made one mistake. I should have said, “We will not build a wall.” Then they would have insisted that we build it, I could have saved two years of litigation. “We will not build a wall under any circumstances.” Then Pelosi would say, “We demand that you build a wall.” These people are terrible. Crazy Nancy, crazy as a bedbug. She’s crazy as a bedbug. She decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor, how did that work out? Not too good, it didn’t work out too well. Can you imagine? The owner of the beauty parlor is a MAGA lady, she loves Trump. Can you believe it?

I don’t know what it is but I think if I owned a beauty parlor, I had a customer, I’m not sure I’d be turning her in. The owner turned Nancy in. That’s a lot of hate. That’s serious hate, right? No, she’s a great owner. As far as I’m concerned, I think she’s fantastic. She’s for us. They said, “What made you do it?” You know what she said, “Because I see how hard our president has to work. I see what they put him through. I see what he puts with and I turned her in.” How about that? How about that?

We love her. She can do my hair anytime. I think I’m going to call her in. Check it out, maybe you can do something. Maybe you can improve it, it’s not bad though. I have friends that … I have friends my age, they’re not looking too good. Instead of standing up for America, Joe Biden and the Democrats, they condemn America and war is always waged on our great law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. Kamala Harris, that’s another great beauty, Kamala Harris, that’s a beauty. Remember, I tell this story all the time. When you pick somebody, you pick somebody that’s hot, that’s going in the right direction, right? She came out, she was at like 14, 15 in the polls, and she started going down, down, down, it never stopped. It drove her crazy. She was terrible at the debates. Wait till you see what …

I don’t want to put pressure on him but wait till you see what Mike Pence does to her in the debates, but I don’t want to put … I don’t want to put pressure on Mike. Do we have a great vice president? Is he good? He’s great, and he loves this state. Loves all the states actually. He’s just a great American but do you remember his last debate? What he did to that character from Virginia? That one wasn’t good. The other guy’s jumping around, Mike is just sitting there, we love America, we’re going to lower your taxes. Thank you, you win. No, Mike is great.

But Kamala Harris and 13 members of Biden’s staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters, take them out of jail, get them out of jail as soon as possible. Including one who attempted to murder a police officer, a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl. This is what we’re dealing with. This is what we’re dealing with. You know Kamala was considered, is considered further left than Crazy Bernie, think of that. They got there … I mean seriously, watch. You know the manifesto that Biden and … It’s not Biden, Biden has not agreed to anything. His people, his representatives, because Biden doesn’t know he’s alive, let’s not kid ourselves. Biden. Biden didn’t agree, he didn’t, they just told him what’s happening. They said, “Listen, you’re against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out. Elizabeth Warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed,”

Pocahontas, you know Pocahontas? Did anybody ever hear of her? She’s another great one. Pocahontas. I said to her a long time ago, I’ve got more Indian blood in me than you do and I have none, I have none. Sadly. I’d love a little bit of it, but I have none, I said … I turned out to be right. She choked and she went for a blood test. Remember? Was it 1024th? Meaning maybe nine hundred years ago, there was a little action going on. Crazy Pocahontas, she’s a nasty one though, isn’t she? She’s a terrible person. I was hoping that she’d win so we could go after her because I think Kamala is not as smart but she’s a little bit less vicious.

I think this. The one who treated Sleepy Joe the worst was Kamala. She accused him of MeToo, she accused him of everything. She accused him of … That he was a racist, right? That he was a racist? Because what he’s done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing. She’s accused him of everything under the book, the busing, remember, the busing scandal. So I said brilliantly he’ll never pick her because she was too terrible to him. She was the worst of everybody. By far, I would say, but she picked him and hopefully that’s going to be history, it’s not going to matter, and that is no way for a woman to become the first president, that’s for sure. If a woman is going to become the first president of the United States, it can’t be her. That would rip our country apart. This is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor, this would not be what people want, especially because it’s her.

Biden has called to end cash bail, you know that right, for vicious criminals? Meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else, you’re right back on the street the next day. He called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy. He says they’re the enemy and he just thinks it’s terrible. He think it’s terrible. Now he’s liking the police much more. It’s a little late. Remember, first instinct, that’s where they’re going, and he has no choice because he has to, because again, I was going to say, the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the Green New Deal, getting rid of your planes. No more airplane trips. Remember the crazy senator from Hawaii? “Do you like the Green New Deal?” “I love it very much,” he said. Oh okay, well you’re the senator from Hawaii, that’s right, the beautiful island of Hawaii. She said, “Under the Green New Deal you basically can’t fly in an airplane.” “Oh that’s a problem.”

So they said they’d build a bridge from the mainland to Hawaii. It’s 2,000 miles long but these are minor details. Remember her when they explained to her that planes are out, cows are out. Cows, they don’t want cattle, they don’t want cows. Did they withdraw that one? That was a tough one, wasn’t it? They don’t want cows, bad for the ozone layer. Who would even think of that? You’d got to be sick to even think it, okay? Give me a break. Give me a break and I guess under that theory this big guy is next, he’s next. No, it’s a sick deal going on there.

To do it the way they want would cost $100 trillion. That’s more money than this country could earn in 1,000 years to do it right. ” We don’t like that building, the windows are too large.” “Okay, let’s rip it down and build a new one.” What windows are you going to have? You’re not going to have windows anymore. Environmental. They love wind too, right? The big windmills, I always say, the greatest graveyard in the world for birds, just walk under a windmill. You will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine, what’s happening, including eagles. You know, in California they put you in jail if you shoot a bald eagle, right? You go to jail, right? These windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long. It’s unbelievable, and yet they want wind, and wind also is very, it’s very hard to store the electricity from wind. So if you go home and you want to watch television because President Trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant State of the Union addresses, if the wind isn’t blowing, the husband looks at the wife, says, “Darling, I’m sorry, you can’t watch tonight. The wind is not blowing.”

“Sorry, you can’t watch tonight. The wind is not blowing.” And she looks at me, “I like the old days. It’s much better.” But the rhetoric of Biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger. Last weekend, two Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range. And we have everybody looking for that creep that did it. I called him an animal the other night. I said, “He’s an animal,” and we were challenged by some people on the left. “He’s not an animal. He’s a human being.” He’s not a human being. They got to find him. They got to find him. And the penalty has to be very fast, very swift and very, very severe. You can’t do that.

We call for the death penalty if you kill a policeman. You know that, right? But the anti police demonstrators, they cheered and cheered when they saw this. And then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital. As president, I’ll always support the heroes of law enforcement and I’ll fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty. They want prisoners to vote too, they wanted to. I said, “So what about the Boston bomber?” Remember Bernie Sanders? He wanted all prisoners to have. And I said, “Does that mean everybody?” “Yes.” So we sent in a question, “Does that include the Boston bomber? Is he entitled to a vote?” And even Bernie is going, “Oh man, let’s get into a different question. This is not a good question.” But we want to get that, we want to take care of it.

If you look at all of the problems that we have, you look at crime, even somebody brought it up today, we’re doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus. You know how many names we have? Like 22 different names. I call it the China virus. We’re doing a great job. But if you want to really see a great job, take New York and some of these other Democrat run states out of it. You’ll see numbers that are unbelievable because New York had a very, very hard time. A lot of bad things happened. But you take a few of the states out and you’ll really see numbers. But by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics, we’ve done an incredible job, including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built. And I think our task force has been incredible. And Mike Pence has done a great job.

Biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers. Biden says he wants to protect black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of African American citizens. The Democrat party’s war on cops has already led to surging homicides in Democrat controlled cities. Yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. They ask him, “What about nationwide? What about the fact that you just had your Democrat national convention?” Where, by the way, we had far many more viewers, millions and millions of more viewers. We had millions of more. I thought it was a great thing.

Did anybody hear Herschel Walker that night? It was … well. You talk about a good football player. He was some player. What a great guy. But all of them, everybody. The first lady did great, Ivanka did great. They all did, they did great. We had some … and some incredible stories, some very sad stories when you look and see what happened. But Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He’s always been a weak person. And that was in prime time. And prime time was 25 years ago. And let me tell you, he’s not old. I always defend him on this. I have friends that are 85, 89, 92, 95, and they’re 100%. There’s just something wrong with Joe. He’s off, okay? He’s off, and I have no problem saying it anymore when I watch the disinformation, because this is not disinformation. This is fact.

If he’s elected, his radical supporters won’t just be causing mayhem on the streets, they’ll be running the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education. And most importantly, they will put many judges on the United States Supreme Court. We can’t have that. We’ll have a totally different country; radical left judges. And that has to do with the Second Amendment. It has to do with right to life, it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down. And they’ll have one, two, three or four, whoever is the next president. And hopefully, that’s going to be us. Not me, us. It’s us.

But I put it, and think of this, by the end of the term, we’ll have approximately 300 brand new, great federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300, which is a record, 300. Give or take a little, tiny bit, but 300. Nobody thought that was possible. I want to thank President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Nobody gets left one opening. A federal judgeship is a big deal. Nobody gets left any openings. He gave us 142 openings. Thank you very much. What happened? They thought Hillary was going to win, so they didn’t push it. And then they said, “Wait a minute, these polls are getting a little close at the end.” And they tried like hell to get some judges approved, but it didn’t work. That’s what happens. You got to go and you have to act fast. You got to get it done. Get it done, right? We get things done like nobody’s ever gotten it.

Oh, he was a great president. He was great. He left 142 judges for the Republicans. He was a great president, right? If you are of that side of the plate of that ideology, and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships, I don’t think you’d rate him as doing a good job. Hey, look at what happened in Iraq, look at what happened with ISIS, look at what happened with our military, look at what happened with our vets. Our vets are better taken care of now than they’ve ever been in the history of our country, but never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. And that’s true. That’s true. And we’re winning the fight and we’re winning this election. This election, we are doing well. They refuse to say it. They refuse to say it, and they hate to say it. It just drives them crazy.

But that night, remember they started off by saying, “This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump.” That was Donald Trump in those days. Now, it’s President Trump. I lost all my friends because of this position. I had friends. “Hey, Don, let’s go to dinner.” “Okay. Good, Richard. I’ll go.” Hey, Don, let’s go.” “Okay, Larry. I’ll see you later. I’ll meet you at a restaurant in New York.” Everybody was nice and loose. You could have a great conversation, and you don’t want to know what we talked about. It’s just none of your business, but we were loose. All of a sudden, I’d become president of the United States.

And these are a lot of … I know a lot of important people. Actually, the people I like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful. I always say, never go out with a successful person. You’ll understand. But I know a lot of very successful people, very, very successful. And now they call me up, “Mr. President, sir, would you like to get together sometime?” I say, “Loosen up. Yes, call me Donald. You’ve known me for 30 years, call me Donald.” “Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President, I appreciate it.”

I lost all my friends because it’s respect for the office, let’s face it. It’s different. They used to be loose, they used to be great. You could sit back, I’m not a drinker, but you could sit back and have a drink, whatever the hell you’re drinking. And now, you can’t do that anymore. You can’t do it anymore. So I have to rely on people in Congress to be my friends. And we just happened to have a couple tonight. And one of them who’s been a great warrior and he’s doing a fantastic job, I just saw you on television by the way, Bryan. Does everybody know Bryan Steil? Bryan Steil; young, handsome, but a warrior. When the fake impeachment happened, it was a total fake, what did we finish up with the Republicans? 197 to nothing, right at the house. One night, it was a fake impeachment. I got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of Ukraine, who I never met before.

If you’re going to do something, at least know him a little bit, right? I never met him. And then they said it was eight times, quid pro quo. That was Adam Schiff. Shifty Schiff, right? And he went before Congress and he repeated my conversation, except that he made it all up. Remember he repeated it? And then I said, “Ah, fortunately, we had that whole thing essentially recorded.” I’m glad I did, but these are very deceptive, deceiving, sick people. And I said, “Well, he lied because there was no quid pro quo.” It was a perfect conversation. But by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it. And Nancy Pelosi was all set. She loved doing it, she from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said. When she saw the conversation, she said to her people, “What the hell did you get me into?” So they could have dropped it, but they said, “Let’s give it a shot.”

So we won. And other than Mitt Romney where we lost a half of [ 01:00:47]. He’s another beauty, Mitt Romney. He’s a real beauty. He couldn’t get elected dog catcher right now in Utah. So we have another great one and he’s really a friend of mine, and he’s been solid. He loves his country and he loves his state, Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much, friend. And a man who just got elected, and he’s from an area that I know very well, we did very well, we got our big, big, fat, beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs. But he was taking a legend’s place, so it’s never easy to replace a legend. That’s Duffy, in case anybody … And they was running and we did a lot of work for him, and it was great.

And he reacted very well under pressure. A lot of people don’t react well under pressure. They choke, they choke. He was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points. And now, he’s your congressman. He’s doing a great job. You got to vote for all these people on November 3rd, Tom Tiffany. Thank you, Tom. And we have a great congressional candidate, Derrick Van Orden. Where’s Derrick? Derrick, good luck. I hear good things, Derrick. You got my total support. I hear very good things. I could only be supportive. Our record is like 222 and three, so I don’t like to have a loss. And I support you a 100%, you know that. You have my total endorsement, all right? I hear you’re fantastic. All right.

And your former congressman who I hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it, especially his wife, Rachel deserves it, she’s just fantastic. He’s fantastic because I know he’s coming back into government in some form. He can come with us. He can stay here. He can maybe run for governor or maybe do something, Sean Duffy. Sean Duffy. No, but he was the World Champion tree climber. And I love sports, right? Anytime you know the world champion at anything, but especially that, and I’ll never forget. I was asking about it. “How was it was?” He said, well, he broke his back numerous times. He broke a lot of bones.

I said, “Let me ask you a question. How much harder was it to go up the tree than down?” He said, “It was easy going up.” The hard part was coming down because if he missed, that was where the danger was, right? That was where the danger. But many times, world champion. Could you still do it today? “A little bit heavier,” he said. You got to carry a little bit more weight. That’s all right. That’s not a good sign though, right? Anyway, great job. We love having you Rachel, thank you very much. You are a friend. Fox and friends, and plenty of other places, right? A lot of personality, a lot of personality. Rachel, she’s been our friend from day one, I think from day one. And her fantastic family too.
 
Tonight, we’re also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally. We’re out there working very hard. We are working in Florida and Alabama and Georgia. We have FEMA. We have everybody there. We just finished in … take a look, we just went to Louisiana, Texas. We’re getting hit by some big hurricanes, but we have it under control. Really good. Our coast guard has been fantastic, by the way. Unbelievable, the bravery. They go into these storms. They go into these storms. They say, “How dangerous is it?” “Sir, it’s very dangerous.” I say, “Yeah. All right.” He said, “Would you like to try it sometime?” I say, “Admiral, no, thank you. I’ll take a pass.” I think they might have a problem with me doing it, but I will tell you, they are … In Texas, they saved 16,000 people two years ago, the coast guard, US Coast Guard.

I think there’s no brand to me, that’s gone up more than the US Coast Guard. So it’s great that we’re getting them new ships. Those ships are all coming in. Nice new ones, all built in the USA, beautiful ones. Most of them have already arrived. My administration will be by their side through every step. We’re working again, very, very hard in the Panhandle. The Panhandle, we love the Panhandle. It got hit hard. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. We passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts. Nobody’s ever done more, more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family.

We’ve virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. So if you die in 100 years from now, and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can stand … is anybody here they have children that they don’t like, or perhaps can’t stand? Because if you do, don’t listen to the rest of this. But if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever, they were being put out of business. They’d have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax, the death tax. And it was a terrible thing. We got rid of it, so now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family. And just hope they remember you every once in a while.

It’s always a difficult situation, but it was. It was ruining farms. They’d have to go out and sell the farm, they’d have to go out and get partnerships, they’d have to go out and borrow money from banks. And then all of a sudden they’re in foreclosure proceedings and they’ve never done that before. They don’t have to worry about that anymore. If you love your family, that’s a big deal. They’ve been trying to get that, Sean, for what, 30 years they’ve been trying to get that, right? Especially for the farmers, because it’s that kind of a business. It’s a great business, but it’s day to day. You have a bad crop, all of a sudden you can’t pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax, right? And they lose their farm. So we’re not going to have that anymore.

We achieved American energy independence for the first time. Totally independent. We don’t have to be in those far away places unless we want to be. Biden pledged to abolish American oil, American jail, clean coal, natural gas. He said the fracking, I told you that, but we’re not going to let him get away. We’ll be bringing that up on occasion. For 47 years, Joe Biden crushed the dreams of Wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries. That’s what happened. Before I got here, what was happening with Japan? And we pay our deep respects to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of all of ours, a great friend of mine. He’s going to be leaving office very soon, like in a matter of a day. And he was a great gentleman. He’s a tough negotiator, I’ll tell you that. He made very good deals against the United States, but he’s somebody that’s going to be missed. He’s a great gentleman. He championed every special interest, Biden, every special interest. And he sold out on trade. He sold out like almost nobody ever before.

Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. You ever hear of that beauty? That would have really hit you. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy American and hire American. I’m watching this Biden and he’s got his sign in front, “Buy American. Oh, by American.” I’ve been saying that for like 20 years, right? Where the hell has this guy been? They were actually accusing him of plagiarism. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Wisconsin jobs. And it’s all jobs, but you got hit particularly hard. Biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. He wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year. I fought like hell to keep them into the China deal and he wants to remove them. So tens of billions of dollars, billions and billions, I gave it to the farmers. I gave it to a lot of people, but I gave most of it by far, to the US Treasury. He wants to take them off. So let me just ask you just a very innocent question. There’s a young man, about four years old up front, I think he could give the answer. Who do you think would like to have China? How do you think China would feel about this election?

In one case, they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the US. We never got ever, 25 cents from China. In the other case, he said, “We’re going to take them off.” I think they might be inclined to go for Sleepy Joe. This is like a dream for China. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. It’s very simple.
So we did many things. Not only China, not only the $28 billion farmers. We did so much and I’m proud to announce that I’m doing even more to support Wisconsin farmers. Starting next week, my administration is committing an additional, you’ve been asking for this for a long time, $13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the China virus, including Wisconsin’s incredible dairy, cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly. Been after that money for a long time. When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, I imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products, saving many, many timber jobs in your state. If Joe Biden gets in, the radical left will shut down Wisconsin’s timber production for environmental reasons. Do you believe that? Oh, boy. It’s so sad to see it, and that would happen. But we can’t let that happen. We’ve come too far. We’re so good. If that virus hadn’t hit us, and it did, and it hit the whole world, but if it hadn’t hit us, we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible. But it did, and we saved a lot of lives. They keep saying, “Oh, they just …” By the way, if we had two people die, they would have said he did a terrible job. If we had 100 people die, if we had 1000, no matter what we do. We have trade deals. We announced a trade deal, everybody is saying how great it is. Schumer and Pelosi see it, they have no idea what the deal is, “We don’t like the deal.” Did you look at it? “Oh, of course, we looked at it. It doesn’t have tariffs. Oh no, it does have tariffs.” They know nothing about the deal.

Automatically, anything we do, they just take the reverse. But you know what? I’d probably do it to them too, so I can’t complain. And perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch up them, they may be a killer, they may be a criminal at the highest order, you take their name. Then you’re supposed to bring them to a court, like Perry Mason, right? But we actually catch them, take their name, release them, say, “Come back in about four years for your court case.” We ended all this stuff. And you think that was easy? It wasn’t easy, let me tell you.

It was tough, but we have a really good, secure border. And the president of Mexico has been terrific. We right now have 27,000 soldiers from Mexico guarding our border, free of charge. We stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens of the worst kind. We’re enforcing the clear requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare. They have to sign a document. We invested $2. 5 trillion in the US military, including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in Marinette. How about that? I was there two months ago.

Marinette. That’s a great company, but it was having a hard time. And now, they’re building, what was that, like $6 billion worth of ships? And their beauties. They’ve started already, and we worked very hard on that. And we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one, because a lot of people wanted that contract. But we got it for Wisconsin, remember that. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. That’s right, the Space Force. The fact is, and somebody said it on the other side, an opponent said whether you like it or not, Trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign. Like Space Force, that’s a big deal. Think of it; army, navy, air force, marine.

… Think of it, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, right. Think of it. I mean, that’s all you heard your whole life, right. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, Coast Guard; and now, we have the Space Force. You know what a big deal, first time in 75 years, it’s a new one. Last one was 75 years ago. The Air Force, right. That’s a big thing. I never talked about that on the campaign, I never even thought about it. When I became president, I said, “We have to do this.” Because I saw what Russia was doing, and I saw what China was doing. And, they’ve created their Space Forces, I said, “What are we going to do?, not have it.” It’s going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because that’s where it’s at, in terms of defense, in terms of offense. We passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great veterans that we had the other day.

Veterans satisfaction, 91 percent, the highest score we’ve ever received. You haven’t noticed, remember years ago, every story, every night, the Nightly News, you’d always have horrible stories about the VA, you don’t see it anymore. Now, I don’t want to give them any ideas, because they’ll search all over the country for a vet who’s unhappy. I’m hurting myself by telling this story. This is not a good story. But remember that, every night you’d have these horror stories about the VA. You don’t see that anymore. 91 percent approval rating. I kept my promise recognized the Capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.

I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace; and, you saw that two days ago, UAE, Bahrain, Israel, nobody thought it was even possible. I saw John Kerry on television the other day. “It is not possible.” Then we waited a little while. He went very, very strong, “It is not possible.” And, it was not only possible, we have many countries that are joining us very soon. We killed the founder and the leader, the vicious leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. And, we also took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many troops and many people, all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead, he’s dead, bad guy, bad guy, very bad guy.

We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home. No one has been more wrong, more often than sleepy Joe Biden. He voted for the Iraq War, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military. I took over a military that was totally depleted, like. Hillary Clinton deleted, as opposed to depleted, she depleted them too; but, she deleted 33,000 emails. When is somebody going to pull the spring? Ah, come on fellows.

No, that’s terrible. 33,000 emails. Try going to court sometime on a civil case, and when you go before the judge, he’ll say, “Did you delete those emails?” “Did you get rid of those texts?” “Did you this…, Right.” And, now they caught Weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation, and they cleaned their phones. How many were there? 21, but they were like 33 phones. And yet, look what they do to General Flynn, and some of these people that did nothing. They cleaned their criminals, yeah, that’s criminal, it’s criminal, they’re criminals. They talk and talk and talk, they’re criminals. They clean their phone, so you don’t have any of the information, but that’s a big problem for them, I would imagine.

It’s a disgrace that they can do it. But, Hillary got rid of… She deleted and acid-wash, right. Who acid-washed? Did you ever… And, she also used to bang them with a hammer, remember that, we forgot that, right. So, let’s see what happens with all of that stuff. I think Bill Barr’s doing an excellent job, I have to tell you. And, he’s fighting a very bad establishment in Washington. There’s some bad apples in that whole deal. But, if you think that Biden opposed the mission to take out of Osama bin Laden, he was against it.

He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS, what a mistake. And, he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for America and the world, I don’t think so. I don’t think so. It’s not been too positive. If it were up to sleepy, Joe Biden, bin Ladin and Soleimani, would be alive. ISIS would still be on the rampage and China would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close, I will tell you. We have weaponry, the likes of which nobody’s seen. 2.5 trillion buys you some good stuff, especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world.

We have weapons, the likes of which nobody’s seen, and just hope to God, we never have to use them. I say that, and I say, it’s strongly. Hope that we never have to use them. My attitude was that, and I’ve learned this a long time ago, by having them, we keep ourselves out of war, as opposed to bringing ourselves in war. But, we have built and created weapons, the likes of which this world has never seen before. And, we don’t have to talk about it too much, nor do I really want to talk about it. When I ban travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic, he said, “He’s xenophobic.” What does that mean? Joe, tell me. Biden also opposed my plan to ban Europe, I saw what was happening in France and Spain and Italy, and highly infected, we banned Europe. If we had insisted and listened to Joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing, which is, “You don’t have to do the ban.” Hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died from the plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives, on the altar of open borders. And now, I hear him talking, he should have followed me. This guy did the swine flu, right, it was a catastrophe. And, the man that headed up the swine flu, I won’t use his name because I’d like to have him have a nice evening, because I can’t imagine the democrats are thrilled. He said, “It was a horrible job, we had no idea what we were doing, it was a disaster.” He said, “It was a disaster.” And now, Biden’s telling us how to do what we’re doing so well on, what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job. And I got sleepy, Joe Biden, trying to tell me how to do it. And, his own man who headed it up, swine flu, it’s H1N1 swine flu. Joe called it, N1H1. I keep saying Joe, Joe, it’s H1N1, right.

I said, “It’s easier to remember because H comes before N,” but he can’t do it. And then, you saw what he said the other day under a Harris-Biden administration. That was a disaster. I never said under a Pence Trump administration, he said, “Under a Harris-Biden administration.” And, what made it worse, is she said the same thing. That was terrible, right. Sean, right. Did you hear that? They are a disaster together.

Through our historic relief programs, we saved more than 1 million Wisconsin jobs and 87,000 Wisconsin businesses, that’s not too bad. And, Biden would demolish all of those games, and we’ve done similar things in other states. He would destroy your social security, totally destroy it, and destroy protections for preexisting conditions. They want to go to social medicine, they want to go to social… You know that, right. You do know that. They want social healthcare where you don’t… Remember Obama 28 times, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, that didn’t work out too well, right. Why haven’t they looked into that one, 28 times. Well, under Medicare for All, but it’s basically socialized healthcare, you will never have your doctor, you will never have your plan. You’ll have horrible healthcare. You’re going to wait long times, long times. And, he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love, 180 million plans. I don’t think so. I don’t think he’s going to make it. How do you get elected? Let’s say you’re doing, not only here, let’s say Texas, right, he’s against oil, he’s against God and he’s against guns.

That’s a tough combination in Texas. How does that apply? Now, he’s against religion. They won’t open these blue states, they will not open your churches. They won’t open them. And, I think they have an ulterior motive. One thing they have is, probably everything opens on November 4th, you understand that. And, they better be careful, those paper ballots you talk about, a bad thing, just get out and vote, get out and vote. And, if you have to go that route, make sure they have it counted. And, they know it’s trouble. They just had another election today, fellows, where it’s a disaster. The votes come in, they have no idea, they can’t count them. And, I don’t mean they’re off by a little bit, they’re off by 20 percent, 25 percent. There’s fraud. There’s missing ballots. They have a woman in New York who is a terrible congresswoman, you know that.

Carolyn Maloney. They gave her an election, they can’t even find the ballots. And, they gave her a victory, and they cant find that the guy that is against her, who did very well, even though he’s even more progressive, I don’t even know what she is. I’ve known her for 25 years. I don’t think she’s progressive. I think she’s whatever she has to be. But this guy, probably or possibly beat her. So, rightfully he’s not too happy. And, they called the election for her and they can’t find the ballots. Wants to force you to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens, you remember he raised his hand, that will totally drain your wonderful Medicare. Remember the question up there, he’s standing up, ” Who is willing to give free healthcare to illegal aliens.” And, everybody raises their hands like fast. Kamala was right up there. By the way, that will destroy your country, you do know that. Because you can’t afford it, and Biden’s looking around, “Oh, they all raise their hand.” He goes, remember. I remember. I said, “Well, there it goes, the election for him.”

He’s end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent. And, that’s the deal he made with Bernie Sanders, opening the flood gates to terror, afflicted nations. But I predict the Sanders people are going to vote for us, like they did the last time. We had a tremendous…. Because they love my stance on trade, because I know trade, and I was telling him much more so, than even Bernie. But Bernie, is right on that subject, that other countries, including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade. Biden opposes, school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Did you know that? Does everybody like charter schools? Everybody likes choice. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We’re all set up to get it done. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans.

It’s really a vote for the American dream, instead of letting Washington change us. And, despite all that we’ve all gone through. We are changing Washington, that’s what’s been happening. And, just in conclusion, and I hate concluding with you because I like you. I like you. I don’t know why the hell I like Wisconsin, but for some reason. You know what helps so, as you know for weeks before the election, she was four up, crooked Hillary, four up, four up, four up, I kept saying, “Do you think we’re going to win?” And I will say, Sean Duffy said, “You’re going to win.” He actually said, “Don’t worry about it.” Right, Sean. I said, “Sean do you think we’re going to win here?” I don’t like these polls, but four down. He said, “Sir, you’re going to win so easy.” And, early in the night, they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.”

And, so when I’m here, speaking in the freezing cold, I’m lucky they had… I said, “Do you think we have…?” It’s very warm in New York and very warm in Washington, it was hot actually. And I said, “Do you think we have a coat on the plane?” They said, “Yes.” I said, “What’s the temperature?” “Sir, it’s 49 degrees.” I said, “How about giving me a coat?” They have everything on Air Force One, that’s the great thing. Got more televisions in any plane in history. They’ve got televisions in closets, on floors, on ceiling. But, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And, we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of Wisconsin. We will rapidly return to full employment, that’s happening very fast, soaring economies; and the record prosperity will be even greater than it was, last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults of law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And, we will ban sanctuary cities, which are deadly.

We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear Arms.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless Foreign Wars. And, you remember with me, they thought because of my personality, they said, “He’ll be in war the first week.” What happened to the war? Remember, we were going to be in war with North Korea. Hillary would have been in war with North Korea. It would have been a nasty one too. But remember, everybody said, I was going to be in war. Everybody said, “Oh, maybe I’ll do something with social security.” And, I did. I saved it and made it stronger. And now, I’m going to make it even stronger. And, they’re going to get rid of your social security because everything’s going to come collapsing down. You will have a depression.

If he gets in, they’re going to raise interest rates. They’re going to raise your taxes, you will have a depression. The likes of which this country has never seen before. And, your 401k’s and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames. I just say it here, hopefully we’re never going to experience it, but that’s what’s going to happen. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I’ve already signed. Further reduced health insurance premiums, or the costs of prescription drugs, which are coming down now. You know, I signed favored nations clauses, their drug companies are not happy with me, I will tell you. They never thought it was possible and rebate clauses. They never thought anybody would do that to them. They made enough money for a long time. It’s time, you got a big break. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. And, we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always, you have a pledge.

We will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And, NASA is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world. And, when I took over three and a half years ago, there was grass growing in the runways, you know that it was closed down, it was a mess. We are now the hottest in the world. You see what’s going up. And, we’ve got a lot of rich guys sending them up too. I liked that better. I said, “Let them do it.” Rich guys like rockets, I don’t know, they like rocket, boom. I see dollars going right up, but they need a good place to launch. We have the best places. We have the best places, so it’s been incredible what we’ve done with NASA. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We’re already there again. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag.

And, we will live by the timeless works of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the State of Wisconsin. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get everybody and get out and vote, November 3rd. From Milwaukee to Madison, from Oshkosh to La Crosse. From Green Bay, how the Packers doing so far? Good team, good people, to right here in… Give me the proper pronunciation. That’s right, thank you, that’s what I said.

We inherit the legacy of generations of Wisconsin Patriots, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed a wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism; and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And, you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you. Thank you.",17/9/20

Well, I just want to say hello, Minnesota. We love you, Minnesota. You’re great. [ 00:12:53]. We’ve got to win Minnesota, because they did nothing for Minnesota except close up that beautiful [ 00:13:03] territory. They closed it up with a pen. Do you remember that one day? You didn’t have your jobs. Then I came along, and I opened it up. So that’s [ 00:13:11].

But I’m thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people of this incredible state. You’re really hardworking American patriots. That’s what you are, and a lot of people haven’t been treated right until I came along. We’ve done a lot of work and a lot of good work, and you had your best year ever last year. The state had the best year you’ve ever had. 46 days from now, we’re going to win Minnesota, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House.

One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees. You know it. You know it perhaps better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. You’re having a good time with the refugees. That’s good. We want to have Omar. He said Omar. That’s a beauty. How the hell did she win the election? How did she win? It’s unbelievable. Every family in Minnesota needs to know about sleepy Joe Biden’s extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet. Well, that’s what’s happened, and you like Omar a lot, don’t you? Biden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with Bernie, right? A 700% increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia. Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700% increase. Good luck, Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves, because if I’m not here, if I don’t win, I don’t know where I’m going to be. But maybe I’ll come over to see Mike. I’ll come and see Mike.

Your state will be overrun and destroyed, and Biden and the radical Left win. That’s what’s going to happen. I’ve been watching it for years. They haven’t treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right.
Thank you. I’ll tell you, these hangers are great. Remember this. It’s a friendly protest. Please remember this is not a rally. You’re not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. You’re not allowed to go to church. You’re not allowed to do anything. The only thing you’re allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down storefronts, blow up stores, and kill people, because that’s considered a protest, and that, they allow you to have. You don’t have to wear masks at protests. So I said, “We can’t have a rally. The most we can have is ten people. But why don’t we just call it a protest?”, because this is a protest. It’s a protest against stupidity. Speaking about stupidity, sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. Think of it. 700% increase. So you’re not happy now? Look at that guy over there. He’s not too thrilled when he hears this. 700% increase is what they have in the manifesto. Now, maybe they don’t honor it, but I would say they’ll go substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your children’s schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals. That’s what’ll happen. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions, jihadist regions. They’ve already been doing that to you, haven’t they? Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorists.

My administration’s keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country. We don’t want them. We don’t want them. We’ve got enough of them. We’ve got enough of them. Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault, robbery, terrorism, and murder, of course. These hardened criminals are back in their country, where they do all the complaining they want, and your children are much safer as a result. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you. If it were up to Biden, and it’s not. It’s the people that’s around him. They are seriously radical Left Democrats, and they’re very dangerous. The offenders are very dangerous, and they’d be running all over your state. Only by voting for me are you going to say … But I hate to say this, and get it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things, and I’ll do it for you again. I’ll do it for you again. But if you vote for me, I’m the difference, and I’m the wall. You know the wall that we’re building on the southern border? I’m your wall between the American Dream and chaos. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob. He has no clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy.

Years ago, I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with, a Democrat, “Who’s the dumbest senator? Who’s the smartest senator?” He gave me a name for the smartest. I said, “Who’s the dumbest?” “Oh, Joe Biden. You didn’t know that?” That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for sleepy Joe.

They do disinformation. They make things up, and they make commercials. They make things up. I’ve never seen anything like it. Everything, they make up. First of all, I’m the one protecting your Social Security. They say, “Trump” … Remember four years ago, they used to say, “Oh, Trump will get rid of Social” … I have protected your Social Security. They’re going to destroy your Social Security.

Another thing, Big 10 football. Did I do a good job? Your team better do well. They’re on the spot. They better do well. Are they going to do well this year? I think so, right? When I brought it back. But I saw an ad. Do you know why I did it, actually? It sort of energized me. Sleepy Joe did an ad that I was against football, that I was against Big 10 football. Give me a break. When I saw the ad, I said, “What’s the problem with Big 10 football?” They said, “They’re not going to open.” “Why?” They say some stupid reason. I said, “These are strong young people. They’re going to do great. Let’s get going.” I called the commissioner, Kevin. Good guy, and we sort of started something. We got it rolling. We had big opposition from a few of the Democrat states and governors, but we rolled over the opposition, and you have Big 10 football. Congratulations. Congratulations. When the far Left riders rampage across Minneapolis and they rampage across your state, how about your police department? Let’s just run for your lives, and it’s not their fault. They were told to do that. You have a good police department. You have good police, but they’re not allowed to do their job. They’re not allowed to do their job. Remember that? They were told to leave the precinct. Leave it, and then they knocked the hell out of that precinct, didn’t they? Had a great mayor. Great mayor. Really, he’s a real [ 00:21:10]. Remember? Did you ever hear of a man, Fiorello La Guardia? Did you ever? I don’t think that happened with him. New York, I don’t think it happened with Rudy Giuliani, did it? What a great job Rudy did. You realize Rudy’s just now really being appreciated. People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great mayor.

Joe Biden called the peaceful protestors. He said these are peaceful protestors, as opposed to sending in the National Guard. They didn’t want the National Guard. Joe Biden said you shouldn’t send the National Guard, and this went on day after day after day. I pushed, and I got it approved. The National Guard went in. It ended within what would you say, half hour? It was about a half an hour. You wouldn’t have Minneapolis. You better remember this when you go and vote and your voting [ 00:21:59]. You’d be saying, “Do you remember when we had a city called Minneapolis? If you remember, it used to be over there. It’s all ashes now. That place was coming down. You didn’t have anything, but wasn’t that a beautiful sight?” Look. All of a sudden, you saw one guy in a black uniform, then another, then another on the street. Remember that street loaded up with CNN reporters? Remember Ali Velshi, shaved head, nice hair, shaved head? Some people say I should do that. Shave the head. Just give it up. [ 00:22:41]. We polled it. I’d go down about 22 points.

They want to poll everything nowadays. I don’t believe in polls. They poll everything. But Ali Velshi, I don’t know anything about the guy, but I know he was standing there. This is really quite a good scene. It’s a friendly protest. Everyone’s acting … and behind him, the entire city was burning. It’s one of the great pictures of all time. The entire city was burning down. That was your city, and it’s a shame it took so long, but the governor finally did it at least. If you take a look at Portland, the governor can’t quite do it. She can’t get there. I speak to her all the time. “Come on, Governor. I can straighten out Portland. Give me less than an hour. Just let us have it for” … because the state has to ask for it. They have to request. It’s a shame. It’s such a shame.

But in your case, we went, and all of a sudden, it was really … That was going to be a bad night, too, right? Remember that, about seven o’clock? Then you see this guy walked out with about a $250,000 outfit on. That’s because it had more computers and this and that. Got the tear gas deal. He’s got the whole deal, pepper spray, got everything, the finest outfit you can buy. Believe me. We just paid for them, and they were very expensive. So we see one, the helmet. How about the helmet with the goggles? You can see at night. You can see at day. You can see whenever the hell you want. So there’s one. I said, “Oh, that’s only one guy.” Then you see another three, then four. Then you see another ten. They were just getting out of the buses, coming from very friendly territory.

Then you have a line, and they were very tight together. There was no social distancing at all, which we’re going to have to speak to them about that. No, they were touching. They were touching, right? So you had the first one. Then you had a second one. Then you had a third one. Then you had another one. Then they said, “March.” I remember this guy, [ 00:24:42]. He got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down. He was down. “My knee, my knee.” Nobody cared. These guys didn’t care. They moved them aside, and they just walked right to … It was the most beautiful thing.

No, because after we take all that crap for weeks and weeks, they would take this crap, and then you finally see men get up there and go right to … Wasn’t it really a beautiful sight? For law and order, law and order. Portland would be easier, because it’s more confined. We’d just [ 00:25:19], and that would be it. But so they had four or five lines. Then they had lines of different … Everybody did the same thing. Did they ever even move one step back? I don’t think so, right? It was just a slow walk right forward. Then they just started walking faster, faster, faster, put a lot of guys in jail, Tom, right? Put a lot of guys … Great Congressman, by the way. Put a lot of guys in jail. Great. Not good. Great. They put a lot of guys in jail that night, Tom, and that was the end of it. I don’t think he had any problem after that. If you had any flare-ups, we’ll send them in again.

But that’s all you do. These are Democrat-run disasters. Look at Chicago. Look at Portland. Look at you with Minneapolis. These are disasters. By the way, are they still trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis? That’s what I heard. See, they never learn. They never learn. They don’t … You’ve got a lot of people here. That’s a lot of people.

I actually like these. We have the arenas. We’ve always filled them up. It’s been great, and the arenas are good, but usually you have to travel 45 minutes. This thing, you have a hangar. The plane becomes your backstop, right? It’s like your curtain. It’s a curtain. You get a free curtain. We’re outside, which actually makes people happy. It even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy, because outside is better. It’s better, and we’re rounding the turn on COVID, by the way. Our vaccines are coming. A lot of things are happening. We’re rounding the turn. We’ve done a great job. We’ve done a phenomenal job. We don’t get credit for that, but we’ll discuss that in a minute.

But when you look at it, when you look at it, our country is amazing. It’s an amazing country. We love this country, and we’re not going to let radical Left socialist/communists take over our country. Okay? They use the word socialist, and socialists aren’t great. But communists are a hell of a lot worse, and that’s where we’d be headed. We’re standing in the way of them, this group of people. But you have a lot of groups of people just like this, every place we go. Last night, you know where we were. You saw that it was all over the place, right? That’s a big state. That’s a great state. Then I see the fake polls. I just saw a poll here, Minnesota. I’m down nine. I don’t think so. I mean, I just don’t think so. I don’t think so, right? I don’t think so. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. This is the craziest thing I’ve seen.
Now I just saw another plane. See the plane? The good thing about these beautiful Air Force Ones, right? That’s the smaller version of Air Force One. I think you had a little bit short runway. So they take the smaller to save about $12. No, they took the smaller one. But the great thing about those beautiful planes, they have more televisions than any plane in history. We have televisions in the closet, on the ceilings, on the floors. I’ve never seen them on the … We have them all over the place, and I’m just coming out. They said, “There he is.” They said, “It’s a smattering of people.” They called it a smattering. They always do that.

Yet Biden with the circles, right? The little circles. He’s got like four people in a circle. You know why he does the circles? Because he can’t draw a crowd. So they put a circle, like he’s supposed to … He’s trying to be legitimate. He’s going to go by the science. He always says science. He doesn’t know what the word science is. So to have these four or five circles, they put people, that way he doesn’t have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40, 50 people.

They had one not so long ago, and you saw this. He couldn’t draw a crowd. It was a big thing. It was his opening or something. Couldn’t draw a crowd. So they made it a round table. So he went in. They only had like 32 people. They said, “This is very embarrassing,” one of his people, and that’s what they do. They’re good. Some of the people surrounding him, they’ll say anything and do anything. They said, “Let’s not make it a speech. There’s nobody here. Let’s make it a round table.” So these people are sitting at a table. They had no idea, and most of them didn’t know anything about politics. They didn’t even know why they were there. Now they’re sitting on a round table, and they’re on television. But that’s what it is. But they say we had a smattering of people. Yes, smattering of about what? 15,000 people in about two days’ notice.

This doesn’t include the 10,000 people, Mike, that they turned away. I hate that they turned them away. You’d think with an airport, you wouldn’t have to turn anybody away, but they have a certain amount. Then sometimes you have Democrats running an airport, and they don’t like all these people here. That’s true. They don’t like it. But if we’re up to Biden, your state would be in ruins. Just take a look at what they’ve done, and I’m going to hit it hard. They make phony commercials about me, and it gives me the right. How about the worst one of all, the worst I’ve ever seen? Standing on a grave of a fallen soldier, and then they had some guy, a source said … There’s no source. The source doesn’t exist. They make it up, and then they take it. It’s called disinformation. You’re not supposed to do that.

I’m not even sure if he knows. He’s too weak to understand, and he’s still weak to control his people. But it allows me to say whatever I want about this guy. The truth is, he’s not fit to be your President. He’s not mentally fit. If Biden’s elected, extremists, like representative Ilhan Omar … Whatever happened to her? You had a great writer who has just made a living off writing about her. She’s done so many criminal acts. Isn’t it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it? I have to say to myself, I say, “How the hell did she get away with that? If we do one” … Look at General Flynn. He didn’t even lie. They said he didn’t lie, right? He’s gone through hell. He’s gone through hell. This guy wrote page after page of criminal acts. Well, let’s see what happens. Who the hell knows? But between her and how about AOC? AOC-

AOC is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house. Right? Joe Crowley. I knew him a little bit. I asked him once I said, “Are you campaigning against this maniac?” He said, “No, she’s just a young girl. No problem.” I called him on election night. Nah, I was going to, I was going to say, “How did that work out, Joe? That didn’t work.”

He was going to be Speaker Of The House. He’s got a certain talent. But you know she had no money, nothing. And all of a sudden she had $2,000,000 and she spent the $2,000,000 all over the place. Her and her boyfriend. Whatever happened to her? Can you imagine if I’d do that? You have to look at that. She spent the $2,000,000 and big story.

But that was it. That’s one quick story. Oh man. Probably the guy who wrote the story, lost his job at the New York Times. Right? He’s now unemployed, but there’s a big story. She spent $2,000,000 on bullshit. If a Republican did that they’d be in jail. You know that. It’s a different standard and it’s a disgrace. And our guys better get on the ball.

Look, let me tell you how about yesterday. They were talking about Russia, Russia, Russia. Again, here we go with the Russia. There’s never been anybody so tough on Russia with the sanctions. Remember Obama would send pillows. I sent tank busters right to Ukraine. I’m the one that exposed the pipeline with Germany. Germany pays them billions and billions of dollars. And then we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia. I said, “How does that work? How does that work? You’re spending billions of dollars for energy to Russia.”

It’s all okay. I’m the one that exposed it. What I’ve done … Hey, they don’t want me to go. But if you look, they don’t want me to win. Russia doesn’t want … Maybe North Korea does because I actually have a very good relationship with him. And speaking of North Korea and you know, it’s okay to have really. You don’t have to go to wars. We don’t have to lose our great soldiers.

It’s good. If I got along with Putin. Somebody said “He gets along well with Putin.” I’m saying to myself, “But isn’t that sort of a good thing? Is that bad.” “He gets along with Putin. That’s a bad thing.” But you saw the head of the FBI yesterday started going Russia. Russia is looking at our election. Russia. Here we go again. Russia, Russia, Russia.

I said, “What about China? What about North Korea? What about Iran? What about … ” They don’t mention anybody else. The narrative seems to be Russia. Millions of phone calls made not one to Russia. Millions of phone calls received not one to Russia. Then he goes, “Russia, Russia.” Then they asked him about Antifa. What do you think about Antifa? “Well, it’s an ideology.” I said, “No, it’s not. It’s a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is.”

It’s unbelievable. Unbelievable when you look at this stuff. But seriously, take a look at the AOC. I call it AOC plus three. Her three people that she tells what to do. And $2,000,000. Dresses, rent, other things. You’re not supposed to do that. Mr. Congressman, are you allowed to do that Sir? You don’t do that. You don’t buy dresses do you? If he does that’s the end of his career right?

No. But it’s terrible. Right John? It’s terrible. Will prosecute him. I mean, why not? I don’t understand it. I’ll tell you what. One friend of mine, very sophisticated guy, very successful guy called me up. He says, “You know. From the day you came down the escalator with our great First Lady, our future First Lady.” He said “From that day the people love her. She gave a great speech at the Republican National Convention at The White House. She gave a great speech.” But said “From the day you came down the escalator with our First Lady. From the single day you’ve been under investigation. You’ve been under investigation by sleazebags. People that now we caught, cleaned up their phones.”

You’re not allowed to do that. Right Mr.. Congressman? My great hockey player. You’re the greatest. Right? But you’re not allowed to do that. You know? We want their phones. “Oh, here they are. Oh, by the way, they happen to be totally deleted.” Like Hillary with the 33,000 emails she deleted.

I think they should look at that. Now even if they don’t find them. And I do believe they’re in the state department. I do believe they’re in the FBI. I do believe they’re in the FBI. But even if you forget about it, she said she had 33,000 emails. And the emails were for her yoga lessons. She’s not big into yoga. If she is, she’s not getting her money worth. Her yoga lessons and her daughter’s wedding. Right? So it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons.

So I said, “Okay, let’s give her five or six each.” What do you think, Mike? Five or six each. Five for the wedding. Make it 30. Make it a hundred. Make it a thousand. A thousand for the wedding. And for the yoga, let’s give her 200. Okay. What about all those thousands and thousands of emails. Probably classified. So Congress … So forget about it. Let’s assume they’re gone because she deleted them and then she acid washed them. And then she hit her phones with a hammer.

I get rid of phones. I’ve never hit him with a hammer. Not even as President. I say, “Yeah. Throw the phone away.” No, no. I’ve never hit a phone. Has anybody ever gotten rid of your phone and taken a hammer and wiped the hell out of it? I don’t think so.

So she gets a subpoena from the U S Congress. Not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and you’re fighting and you’re fighting or something. By the way you do that, you’ve got problems in court, big problems. But she gets a subpoena from Congress. U.S. subpoena, the most important subpoena you can get. They get the subpoena. And after she gets the subpoena, by a few days everything is deleted. Her phones are busted up and cleaned and wiped. And everything’s gone.

And nothing happens to her. Forget about what was on. Now think of how angry it makes me when I see it. Now how angry? Could you imagine if I’d do that it’s a whole different ball game. Know how angry it makes me when I see it.

And we had an attorney general that didn’t have a clue. That was my fault. I was loyal to somebody. Endorsed me early. You know whey he endorsed me? Because I went to Mobile, Alabama. We had 55,000 people show up at a stadium. He said, “I’d like to endorse you.” Then after we won, he said, “I’d love to be attorney general.” And I said, “No, I don’t think so.” But after four or five times asking, I’m a loyal person and I did it. The mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty, but that’s okay.

But allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace. Maybe there’s something they can do. So forget about looking for the emails. And they are available. And I guarantee they’re in the State Department. I guarantee you they’re in the state department that ought to damn well find them. They’re being protected in the State Department.

But forget about that. Almost as good is the fact that you’re not allowed to do what she did and her lawyers should pay, Kendall should pay, equal consequence. Equal consequence. Equal. But that’s the way it is. But we are making a lot of progress if you see what’s going on. I said to myself, “I’m going to stay uninvolved. I don’t have to. Chief Law Enforcement Officer, can you believe it? But I think it’s better if I stay uninvolved.” And I have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent Attorney General. Bill Barr. And I’ll be honest, he’s a smart guy. I think he’s getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day. I think he’s not going to put up with this stuff. I don’t think. And you know he’s got a lot of people that are deep staters, whatever you want to call them. They fight him at every turn. They fight him, fight him, fight him. But he’s getting tougher and tougher. I watched over the last three days, I’m saying, “Wow, that’s sort of what we’re all waiting for. Right?”

But she deletes her emails. AOC gets rid of $2,000, 000. Gets rid of it. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. And then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we? And she controls Nancy Pelosi. Actually Nancy Pelosi would love to get rid of her I think.

How about Pelosi? Pelosi goes out and says, “You know. I think I have my hair done.” So she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor. I told the story in Wisconsin last night.

By the way, we had that great crowd in Wisconsin. You have a feeling about places. You know the problem with Minnesota is that I think since 1972, this hasn’t been won by a Republican. So, you’re a little behind the eight ball when you hear that. Right? I mean, I can understand. And Wisconsin rarely. But I won Wisconsin. Unlike Minnesota thank you very much. Thank you very much, Tom. Thank you. Unlike Minnesota.

But it’s my fault. So I had one speech left. It started at one in the morning. I went to Michigan, we won Michigan. That was another one. Great state. We brought back so many auto companies into Michigan. We brought them back. But I had one. It was already voting day. It was election day. Because by the time I got there it was just scheduled. Had I made that one damn stop to your state we would have won Minnesota. I lost by what? A half a point. Half a point.

But I get off the plane and they said, “He’s in Minnesota. He’s down nine.” The recent poll. Down nine. I believe it’s a suppression poll. And you know, I have an instinct about things pretty much. Somebody said “Trump has the greatest political instincts of the last 100 years.” One of my enemies said that. And I said, “No, I don’t.” I don’t believe I do. I think I have lousy political instincts.” But what am I going to tell you? Let me just say they said that. And I was very impressed by the statement.

In fact, I went to my wife I said, “You know, they say I have the greatest political instincts in over a hundred years.” And I said, “But I don’t believe it. I don’t.” I don’t want to be Beto. Remember Beto? “I was born to run for president.” That was the end of his career. Beto O’Rourke who’s in charge of guns.

By the way, he’s going to take your guns away. You know that, right? Biden. Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe is going to take your guns away. Remember Beto on the cover of a really crummy magazine. I won’t mention the name. They’ve got a lot of bad magazines out there. The good news is most of them are dying. If not all of them.

But Beto O’Rourke, he did the story and he was going to defeat Ted Cruz. He was going to do all these things. Ted beat him. And I helped a lot too. I was with Ted all the way. And I think Ted’s appreciated it. But I even said, “I’m putting Ted Cruz as one of the people for the Supreme Court.” Right?

And you know why I did it? You know why I did it? Because I wanted to make sure that I had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people, unbelievable. The smartest, the best. The absolute creme de la creme, right? The best minds in the country. Conservative. They believe in the constitution. Little things like that. But I said, “You know. I have to have somebody that we’re going to make sure we get approved.” And the only one I could think of is Ted, because he’s going to get 50 Republican votes and he’s going to get 50 Democrat votes. They’ll do anything to get them out of the Senate.

But I joke when I say that to Ted. But I say it all the time. Ted is the only man I know could get a hundred votes from the Senate. Every single Senator is going to vote for him. But he’s a great guy. And he’s a brilliant guy. And he’s been great. He’s been really great. I kid, when I say that. But one of the things we’ve done that’s so good is the Supreme court. We have two Supreme court justices. We will have at the end of my term, approximately 300 federal judges and [ 00:45:09]. Right?

So anyway, but just to finish, there’s no way that I’m nine points down. I look at a crowd. So they say instinct, right? So I look at a crowd and whether I have good instinct or not, this is not the crowd of somebody that’s going to finish second in the state to a Sleepy Joe. Finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together. Now it is an ideology. It doesn’t matter. I could put that broken piece of wood right there. I could put that out. And it’s the same thing as Joe. It’s just an ideology. It’s just an idea.

Now, historically, we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that they’ve ever opposed. You heard that. Like 36 points. In other words, they’ve got no enthusiasm for him. I have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell. But he does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. His only enthusiasm is put anybody in there. Right? Put anybody in there. He does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. Nothing for him, but to beat Trump. Okay.

But historically that never wins. When somebody has to rely on winning because of somebody as opposed to winning because people love you, people respect you … And Sean Hannity did something the other night. He said to this man, “If you owned a McDonald’s hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area, would you have Joe Biden running that stand?” The answer is no. He doesn’t have the energy. He doesn’t. So he can’t run the country.
 
No, seriously. I thought it was good. I never thought of it. You wouldn’t have him running your business. You wouldn’t have him running a McDonald’s. I have to say or a Wendy’s. I have a friend he owns Wendy’s. He always gets up. Ken, you haven’t mentioned Wendy’s? Okay. But you know you wouldn’t do it because he couldn’t do it. And yet he’s running for the presidency. He’s got no energy.

I made a comment that somebody had low energy. That was the end of his political career. But Joe’s energy is far lower. It’s far lower. No, it’s far lower than Jeb. Jeb was on the low side. But Joe, he’s off the scale. Right? Joe’s got nothing going. Today Biden delivered remarks, barely, to a union after spending 47 years giving their jobs to China and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash. How about his statement?

Hey, we talk about AOC being crooked. She’s a hundred percent crooked. Okay. But were talking about that. Look at Omar. She came in here. Did she marry her brother? Where’s that writer? That writer should be given the Pulitzer prize. He never will be. He should be though.

You know the amazing thing, all of these writers, New York Times, Washington Post, right? Russia, Russia, Russia. Trump. Russia, Russia, Russia. I had 19 people. All brilliant. All radical left. All Hillary people. Actually not even a never Trumper from Bush. Okay. All Hillary Clinton people mostly, almost everyone. They were all Democrats. How about this? You’re being investigated by 19 Democrats that are smart people. Okay? Smart people.

So my friend says, “You know, you are the most honest person in the world. And you’ve taken three years of total investigation.” You don’t think they’ve gone over my taxes. They went over at the biggest tax firm in the country. The most prestigious. They went over everything. They spend 48 million as it comes out now. It’s about $48,000,000 investigating me before I won and after I won. And we caught them spying on my campaign. That’s what they were really doing.

And now with the phones, I think there’s like 22 or 24 people. You heard this one? They said, “No, no, no. We made a mistake when we deleted our phone.” You know what they had to do to make that mistake? Like 19 different formulas. Right? I don’t even know how you delete a phone. I didn’t know you could do it. But they all made the exact same mistake. That’s not good. That’s not good. So let’s see what happens to them. It’s a criminal act you know that, right? It’s a criminal act. It’s criminal.

Weissman’s a bad guy. Put a lot of people in jail that shouldn’t be in jail, Weissman. He’s a bad guy. He’s on CNN all the time or MSNBC which I call it MSDNC. Because it’s the same thing. Owned by a company called Concast. Did anyone ever hear … With an N, not an M. Con like a con job. Concast. They a fortune on public relations. Comcast has delivered you the news, all the news. And they spend a fortune. And then I go up and make one speech and I call them Concast And that’s the end of the PR for the year.

They are a bad group of people. They’re sick. I mean, they’re sick people. They’re sick and evil people and they want bad things for our country and they don’t report the news. You know, in the old days, when you used public airways free, you had to get a license. I keep saying, “If they’re reporting fake news, how come they can keep getting a license?” Whether it’s ABC, whether it’s NBC, CBS, or of course, CNN. Which is I mean one of the great jokes of all time, CNN. Or MSDNC. But they’re cable so I guess there’s a different standard.

But when you’re using the public airwaves free. Okay? Free. Aren’t you supposed to get licensed? So I asked my people that. I ask a couple of guys and I never really get an answer. I just want to know a simple question. Do you have to report the truth when you using free airwaves and making a fortune with commercials and everything else. And I never get the right answer because there are people down deep. It’s crazy. But we’re getting down to all of it.

A lot of progress has been made. I think you’re starting to see it. We’re trying to beat a terrible group of deep state people. You know I came to Washington … Think of it, think of it. I came to Washington and I had 24 years of putting people in office. And then you can probably add another four to that. And another four to that. I had many, many years, decades of people putting … So I came. Been to Washington I guess 17 times I never stayed over. Right? Never slept over. I was there 17 times.

I tell the story. I was in Washington and my entire life, DC, 17 times. Never slept over ever not once. And all of a sudden I’m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue and I’m with a beautiful woman on my right named Melania. Think of this. And I had about 400 motorcycles in front of me. And we’re in a cavalcade of about 128 cars. Most of them having about 15 sub machine guns inside. There’s more firepower [ 00:20:13].

But we’re riding down the beautiful Pennsylvania Avenue. And I look outside at those police. I love our police. We’ve got to treat our police better. I had everything. I had police. I had military. I had soldiers. I had everything you could possibly have. You never saw so much how power and strength and beauty. The beauty.

And they were so proud. They’re all saluting, they’re so proud. They’re happy to have gotten rid of that crowd that was there before us. They’re proud. They’re great. The police. You know, every single police force I think endorsed me. I got the one yesterday from Chicago. That’s not easy. Chicago endorsed me. New York’s finest endorsed me. Florida. Ohio. I mean, everybody. I don’t know that he’s gotten one vote. Then he says he can’t mention the words law and order.

But I’m driving down the street. And I look at my wife, I say, “Do you believe it? I’m the president of the United States? [ 00:53:18] Can you believe it? And then I get to the most beautiful house in the world. I can have Mar-a-Largo and all of them. But I’ll tell you The White House is still The White House, no matter how you do it.
 
And I get to this gorgeous, beautiful place. And I’m up at the incredible suite level and there’s Abraham Lincoln’s suite. It’s called the Lincoln bedroom. Remember Clinton used to lease it out to people for money. They never change do they. Remember when Barbara Streisand, she’s another beauty, by the way. But remember Barbara Streisand used to stay in that suite? Which was the only problem I had with it. But tell me … No, but I do like her voice. I do. I really do. Some of them I don’t like even their voices. But she used to stay there.

And I’m standing in the Lincoln bedroom. The history of the whole thing. The bed, the desk, the Gettysburg address, the beautiful four score and seven years ago. This beautiful Gettysburg address. He wrote it there. And also on his carriage ride up to Gettysburg. He delivered the Gettysburg address and they say the only one that got worse press than I did was Abraham Lincoln. Did anyone ever hear that? And I said, “No way they got worse. Maybe he got bad. But no way he gets worse.”

Now people are starting to say, “It’s probably true. I think you’ve got the worst.” Now they used to say, “No, no.” Newt Gingrich, great guy. He said, “Nope, Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. They were worse to him than anybody. He was a very depressed person. His wife was very depressed.” It was a depressed kind of a thing. He’s in a war, he’s in a revolution. And he was getting beaten a lot by Robert E. Lee. They want to rip his statue down all over the place. But Robert E. Lee whether you like statues or not, they don’t rip statues down anymore. I signed a law. 10 years in jail if they rip them down.

But Robert E. Lee won many, many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day. It was supposed to end immediately because the North was too powerful for the South. But it just shows when you have leaders, when you have a great general. And Robert E. Lee, he would have won except for Gettysburg. And that was because his general was killed who’s going to lead Gettysburg. Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill. He heard they were going up hill. Stop them, stop them. But we had no cell phones in that day, right? Congressmen? No cell phones.

So they sent the horses to stop him. Stop him. But it was too late. They fought uphill and they got slaughtered. That’s what happened. But Robert E. Lee these were incredible things. But I hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments. And I said to my people four months ago, I said, “This is crazy. These people.”

And they don’t even know. They started ripping down Abraham Lincoln. When they hit Lincoln I said, “Wait a minute. This is the man. And you can’t do …” Then they hit George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. They hit everybody. They even had Gandhi. All Gandhi wanted was one thing. Peace. May we have peace. Rip down the statue we don’t like it. I don’t think they have any idea what they’re doing. I think they’re just a bunch of thugs. Okay? You want to know that? I think they are a bunch of thugs.

They were going to March on Washington and they were going to rip down a statue of Abraham Lincoln. You know the exact statute. Its up very nicely. Up now. And by the way, they can take them down legally. They go through Congress as a way of doing it. But they didn’t want to do it that way. And they were marching on Washington. And I said, “Do we have any laws about this?” They said, “No, sir.”

Now in Congress, the way it is now, the most you get is about a $10 fine. You rip down a $5 million statue and you got a $10 fine. Right? It’s different world. That’s when it was strong and they had laws. But we told and found this old act. And the old act said, if you rip down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in prison. They call it prison, not jail, which sounds even worse. I said, “Bring that sucker up immediately to the Oval Office because there are a lot of people coming to Washington.”

They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. Do you believe that? The Jefferson Memorial. We grow up … The Jefferson Memorial. They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. They were going to do damage to our beautiful Jefferson Memorial after Thomas Jefferson.

And I did predict that. A friend of mine said, “You know, two years ago you said, next will be Robert E. Lee and then comes Washington. And Jefferson and Lincoln. They’d never stop. The only thing they understand is strength. Remember that.” They don’t understand weakness. There’s nothing you can do. These really stupid heads of these corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars. It’s like blackmail money, right? But these stupid people that run, they get $40,000,000 a year and they’re weak. Okay, they’re weak. But these people, they’re anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength.

So I said, “Let me see this document.” I said, “Wow, this is a very strong document.” And Derek is here. One of my attorneys, he did a great job. I don’t know where the hell Derek is. He’s around here. Actually he’s heard this before though. Not quite.

You’re getting a very unique speech tonight. You know? I mean unlike Joe, I haven’t even looked at the teleprompter. This guy will “Move it up. Move it up. I can’t see. Move it up.” I haven’t looked at it. The poor teleprompter guy he’s sitting there “What do we do? We’re on line two of the teleprompter.” He said, “What do we do?” No, unlike Joe, I have not looked at the teleprompter.

Oh, that poor Joe. You know what’s the worst part about him looking at the teleprompter? The worst part is that means that the fake news media is giving him the questions. Right? Like Donna Brazil, who was brilliantly hired by Fox. Fox has changed a little bit. Ladies and gentlemen, Donna Brazil, who was fired by CNN because she cheated and she gave crooked Hillary the questions to the debate.

How would you like to be me? They give her questions to the debate. And I still won the debate and she had all the questions. Think of it. How do you do that? Donna Brazil is, ladies and gentlemen, she’s going to work for Fox. Oh, that’s great. That’s big difference. Big difference between four years ago and now. A lot of things have changed.

But I’ll tell you what’s changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago. It’s amazing right? But just to get back to the others. So I signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law. And it says 10 years. It doesn’t say, you get 10 years, but you can take it down to three weeks. It says 10 years.

So these guys had just gotten there. I had a news conference because I had to let them know about it. Right? We’ve got many people in jail right now from before nobody even talked about taking statues down. No, but I looked at the Andrew Jackson right? With the ropes. And I’ll tell you, the police did a great job. And Mark Meadows did a great job. He said, “Charge.” They charged.

And they took these guys out and they were fairly tough. But the police were much tougher. DC police. They did a great job. They were watching and they weren’t able to do anything. Mark Meadows said “Charge.” It was like from 200 years ago it was crazy. They charged and they’d beat the hell out of these guys. Or you wouldn’t have that great statue on the horse of a great general. He was a great general. And he was a very good president. At least a good president. But he was a great general. The battle of New Orleans. Right?

And they had this incredible picture of Andrew Jackson. And they were going to rip it down. And remember the ropes wrapped around the horse and the guy standing up there just [ 01:01:55]. He went to jail too. We had all the evidence we needed. Thank you for that. I want to thank you fake news. We called the fake news. We said “Can we just have that please?” When they said, no, we just said, “We’ll take it off TiVo. That’s okay. Don’t worry about it.” One of the greatest inventions in history. Tivo better than television because television is useless without it.

So, we signed it. And all of a sudden these same guys who were watching it, they left. Nobody showed up the next day. They’re going to have 25,000 people. They had 24 people, 5 of them were brought to prison. Okay. And the next day they said, “Well, we were going to save it for Saturday night.” And Saturday night nobody showed up. And nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue. It’s true.

Because you know why? They look and they say, “I want to take down that statue. I’m going to take down that statue. That statue’s coming down.” And then somebody says, “You know it’s 10 years in jail.” They go, “That’s too much. I’m getting out of here.” It’s true. Ten years is not acceptable, Mike. Right? Ten years is a lot to rip down a statue, have a little fun, especially when they have no idea what they’re ripping down. But we have an idea what they’re ripping down. They’re ripping down in many cases, greatness. They’re ripping down our past. They’re ripping down our history.

And that’s where these guys begin. They take away your history. You look at the Middle East, you look all over. Look what ISIS did. Look what all of them do. They go down and they rip. They go into museums and they break everything and they rip everything. They want to take away your past. They’re not taking away the past of the United States of America. Not as long as I’m here.

What do you want? Do you want me to go back on teleprompter anybody? Okay. Here’s the question. My poor guy must be having a fit. He’s over there. He’s so good at this stuff. He’s on line three.

… Good at this stuff. He’s on line three. He said, “Sir, should I use turn the sucker off? Would you rather go teleprompter or freelance?” Isn’t it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either? See, Joe doesn’t have the option. He doesn’t have the option. But if Biden wins, China wins, and it’s very simple. It’s very simple. By contrast, I rescued the Minnesota Iron Range, I did that.

Just so you know, O-Biden. I call him O-Biden, it’s too long to say Obama and Biden, so I just go, O-Biden, because I don’t care about… Everyone said, “Oh no, he’s in trouble. Obama’s now campaigning.” Hey, he campaigned last time harder than Hillary. I said, “No, I want him to campaign because he brings out the base.” He brings out our base. And I’m only here because of him and Joe.

If they were a good president and vice president, I wouldn’t be here. I had a very good life before. I’m doing this because they did such a [ 01:05:14] job. I’m only here because of him. I could right now be having a very beautiful life of luxury, and here I am at the hangar in Minnesota with 15 or 20 or 25,000 people. And thousands of people that couldn’t get in, and I’m working my ass off. I could be at home having a good time, wonderful time. But the one thing I said is-
But I say this. I say this look, I could be home. So home was New York. I had to bail out because it was too crazy, everything has fallen apart. But home, it’s so sad what the democrats have done to our great New York. Between a governor and a mayor, the crime is through the roof, the corruption is incredible, it’s a sad thing that’s happened to New York. Hopefully it’ll come back by somebody. Somebody will go in there and do like a Rudy.

You know when Rudy took over, it was so bad and they were looking for somebody and they thought he was the guy because he was a tough guy. But somebody has to go in and clean it up. This mayor, he let go of a billion dollars worth of police. He actually believed the nonsense about defunding the police. And they’re all going to do it. They’re all going to do it. And New York people are going to do it. I’m being totally serious now. You’ve got to go out and you’ve got to vote for Trump. You got to break this spell from 1972. You saw Kenosha. What we did for other places, you saw the Kenosha, and that was gone. That was all gone. That place was gone. We sent in the troops, it was incredible what we did, and they did it on day three. Day three is better than two weeks later, like in Minneapolis. But they did it, and we’ve done a great job and the people of that great state, they understand it, and I just hope the people of your state of Minnesota understand it because we don’t have too many more chances with this stuff. We really don’t. We don’t have the luxury of sitting back and saying, “Let’s have four years of this maniac, vice president that he picked who treated him worse than any other person.

That’s why I say the one person that he won’t pick… My great instincts, right? The one person he won’t pick is Kamala because she called him a racist, she tried to me-too him. He was me-too’d. “I’ve just been me-too’d Darling, what does that mean?” But they tried to me-too him. And she was the one that brought it up.

Remember Tara? She was the one that brought it up, and then he goes, “Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to pick… Wait a minute, let me get her name here. How do you pronounce it? It’s with a comma, like a comma, right? Like a comma.” Remember he couldn’t pronounce her name? He was saying her name wrong, and she had to interrupt him. No, my name is Kamala. Like comma. I remember that. Like a comma. H1N1, that’s right, Joe. Remember that Joe, H1N1.

And how bad did he do in that though? How about that? How bad did he do? So come to think of it, he’s out there now today. It was pathetic. By the way, did you see the Anderson Cooper thing last night? You have to watch. I don’t want to watch, but I have an obligation. I’m competing against somebody. You don’t want to compete and say, “I’m not going to watch my competition, who wouldn’t?” It’s boring, but I got to watch.

And he got through it. He met a couple of really… The chicken thing was bad. He said chicken many, many times, and it was a little strange that I thought it was over and he pulled it back. He was able to pull it back. But Anderson is a… And he interviewed me, he’s tough. You know, he can be tough, nothing against him. He could be very tough, but last night he was in rare form. He was, “Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Vice President, are you enjoying the run?”

And compare that with my shot, where they asked me about doing ABC with George Stephanopoulos. I think it was great. I think it worked out great. You know what I call it? Debate prep. I call that free debate prep. But you know it’s nasty, it’s a little nasty that people… and I didn’t say, “No, you got to change the rules. No, give me the questions. I want to use a teleprompter to answer.” How about that though? Mr. Vice President, I’d like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to China and Russia and where are they in the race?

Well, you can’t have this as your president. I don’t care. Forget about me. You can’t do this. The importance and the power of this position are too great. You can’t do it. I’ve learned a lot as president. But one thing I learned is that President Xi of China is sharp. You ever see him standing with the two million men walking in front, everybody’s the same height, they’re wearing hats, everyone’s like a pool table, right?

And he’s standing there by himself, and he’s looking like he’s not playing games. There’s no games, he’s sharp as you can be. And I had a great relationship, but now I feel differently. We made a great trade deal, and now I feel differently. But he’s a sharp as you can be. Putin as sharp as you can be. Kim Jong Un, we would have been in a war with North Korea 100%.

I asked Obama, “Did you ever call him?” He said that was the toughest problem we had. And we get along. Remember about a month ago, two months ago, they broke into the demilitarized zone and they said, “Oh, he’s going to attack.” I said, “No, he’s not. Don’t worry about it.” I got to know him very well. We have a good relationship. People said, “He has a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, that’s terrible.” I said, “No, that’s good.”

But you remember it was going to be a nuclear war, and I got along with him. Then they said, “Trump made a terrible deal. He’s given so much to North Korea.” What did I give? I was at like a semi debate with his idiot, a reporter. “He’s given a lot to North Korea.” “What did I give?” “I don’t know.” Sanctions, sanctions. You took away. No, I didn’t. Actually, I increased the sanctions very substantially. What did you give? What did I give? Tell me. So after about four days they couldn’t ask because I gave nothing except I gave heart because I don’t want to see people killed on their side either. I don’t want to see people killed.

We’d win that. We’d win them all. We have the greatest weapons right now ever conceived by man. We’ve rebuilt our military to a level that nobody ever thought possible. And then the fake news. And I said that a couple of weeks ago, remember I said, “We have created the most powerful weapons known to man.” It’s true. We have weapons that are so advanced that President Xi, Putin, everybody, we’re the envy of the world.

But they don’t know quite what we have, but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before. And some schmuck back there said, “I think he’s given away classified information.” Now, all I’m doing is telling the world, we have the most powerful weapons in the world. I’m not even saying what kind. You don’t even want to know about it. And God help us if we ever have to use them. But we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man. They have the missile, the super-duper, hydro sonic, I call it the super-duper, it goes five times faster than a normal missile, right?

We have one goes much faster than that. But Russia got that information from the Obama administration. Russia stole that information. You knew that. Russia got the information and they built it. But we have now one that’s much faster than that. That’s like a slow missile. That’s like considered a slow missile.

But I said it was incredible. Two weeks ago I said, “We have the finest, the best, the most incredible, sadly, the most deadly, and we never want to use it, but we have the greatest weapons ever in history by a factor of 10, by a factor of 10.” And they went crazy. “He’s given away classified.” These people are sick. All I’m doing is saying that we rebuilt our military $2.5 trillion all built in the USA, every single ounce of it.

We have fighter jet, F-35 that are so good, you can’t see it. And I went to see the program, and I met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than Tom Cruise. They’re tougher. They’re stronger. They’re bigger. They’re more powerful. They’re smarter. And I like Tom cruise by the way, because you can’t get much better than Top Gun, right? Great movie. You can’t get better. I like Tom cruise. But these guys are better looking than Tom. They got that crew cut, they got the crap under their eyes, they got the whole deal. They’re smart as hell.

So I said, “So captain, let me ask you, how good is the F-35?” “They’re really good Sir, best plane we’ve ever had all great.” I said, “How do you compare that with what Russia has?” “Well, ours is better for a specific reason, Sir. You can’t see it.” “What does that mean?” “Well, when we fight, they cannot see us, that we are so stealth.”

Now that doesn’t mean in three years that it won’t be obsolete because that’s what happens. That’s the problem with that business. You come up with a new computer and two weeks later it’s obsolete. That’s why I always like real estate, and grab a piece of real estate. But no, it’s true. I wouldn’t be good in that business. You get to work, work, work, and then you’re starting the next one because the last one is gone. That’s why I always talk about walls and wheels.

When the Democrats were saying, “Walls are old fashioned.” Well, they’re right about that. But they work. Remember that? All we had to go through in Congress? And that wall is going up, think of that. We’re building 10 miles a week, 10 miles a week of the top. And our numbers on the border are the best they’ve ever been. The best they’ve ever been.

Well, we’re building 10 miles of wall a week. We’re up to about 330 miles, and we’ll have it finished very soon, and it’s having a tremendous impact on drugs. It’s having a tremendous impact on all of the different things. Human trafficking in women. It’s not even children.

They’re trafficking women, it’s because of the internet. You think of that as almost an ancient kind of a crime, right? But it’s not. It’s a very modern crime and it’s an unbelievably profitable crime. They’re trafficking women, little bit children, but mostly women. Where they’ll put three or four women in the back in the trunk of a car and they’ll go through the border. They can’t do it anymore. And we’re catching them. We have people that do nothing but look for the traffickers. To me, the traffickers are the biggest scum of the world.

And thank heavens for ICE, and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don’t want. I know Mike doesn’t want it. You wouldn’t even be good at it, Mike, he’ll do a commercial about it. That’s what he’ll do. Does he have the longest commercials in history? I say, Mike Lindell. I say, Mike, the pillow man. I say, Mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history. I want him to buy my commercials.

I say, “You know, we spent $20 million, I sell like two commercials.” He spends $2 and he’s got the whole day on Fox. I said, let Mike buy our commercials. Will you? I don’t know what the hell you do, but whatever it is, you better tell me the secret. Greatest purchaser of commercials.

But we have done some job with that. And the traffickers and drugs are way down. Now we got upset with the pandemic, but I watched Biden today talking about, “If only Trump moved one week sooner. One week.” So let’s go, ready? So, you know he was against the ban, right? Because he didn’t think we had a problem. So he was against the ban. He didn’t know that China was heavily infected. He doesn’t even know where China is, in my opinion.

But he was against the ban. These guys write stuff out for him, and he tries to read it. Doesn’t do well with it. So he was against it, but now his new thing is, if only I moved one week earlier, but I was earlier than everybody. If you think about it. I had nice guy, Dr. Fauci, I had another nice, got a lot of doctors. They were all telling me, “No, no, you don’t have to do that.” Tom knows that very well. “You don’t have to do that, Sir. You don’t have to do that. You don’t have to do that at all.”

And one of those things, I was very early and I banned and everybody admits that had I not banned highly infected Wuhan province, right? Highly infected, we would have had hundreds of thousands of more deaths. And then you had the chart. I put it up yesterday, I’m doing these news conferences. We’re finally getting the word across that we did a great job, but I’m doing news conferences now every day.

I call them the highly rated news conferences. And I go before these crazy people, they’re screaming like maniacs. It’s not the way they treat Sleepy Joe. He’d melt. If they ever did a number on, this guy would be there he’d be laying on the floor crying, “Get me out of here, Darling. Where is my wife? Get me out of here, please, Darling. They’re so nasty to me today. What happened?” We go through it every single day.

But you think about it, and he said, “If only Trump moved faster,” but he’s the one that two months later called me xenophobic, and he called me a racist because I was banning China, which was heavily infected. And then he said, “Don’t ban Europe.” Well, I looked at Italy, big problem. I love Italy. I love the people of Italy, but they were heavily infected. France, I looked at France, I looked at Spain, they even had spikes recently. Did you see?

And we’re doing great. We’re rounding it with or without, but we’re going to have with, but you know, with his better, but with or without, we’re rounding that corner, and we’re rounding it fast and they don’t want to give us any credit because they want to keep this up ’til November 4th. And on November 4th, the press will probably say, let’s say something stupid happened. The press will say, “I got to admit he did a damn good job.” And the other clown will be in office. We did a thing called price transparency. I signed it. It’s effective, also very complicated. It’s on your medical. And we did price transparency. It’s the biggest thing. It’s bigger than healthcare. Where you see your prices. You can go now to hospitals, you can price operations, you can price everything. It’s a massive thing.

The man who did it… And I took a lot of heat, and I’m doing favorite nations drugs, meaning whatever the lowest in the world is, we have to pay the same. That’s the good news. The bad news is the drug companies, the doctors everybody’s angry at me. Actually under price transparency, the good hospitals and the good doctors benefit tremendously, but the bad ones don’t, and you have price transparency. And it goes into effect on January 1st. Could you imagine if this sleepy guy gets in and they say like, February, March, April something. They say unbelievable what happened to prices, it’s dropping like crazy.

And they’ll say, what a job he’s doing this president? And I’m the one that signed it. I said, could you put it into effect but statutorily? It has to mature, mature, mature. So the earliest I could get is January 1st. It’s like crazy. You know another one? I’ll give you another one. I’ll give you another one. So Air Force One, so that’s the 757, but they have a 747, which is the big Air Force One.

I think that just disrespected the people of Minnesota today, they gave us the little one. No, actually it’s because of the runway. In fact, when we landed, they said, “Sir, we have a very short runway, could you please hold on? I said, “I trust these pilots.” By the way, these pilots are the best pilots. When you fly the president of the United States.

Wait a minute, he’s waving from the window. When you fly the president of the United States, you are the best flyer. They take the best air force guys, they take the best Marines in the helicopters, Marine One. But when you’re flying these planes, you can land that sucker, you have no problem. There’s no, mishits. There’s no, “Let’s go around. I can’t quite make it, Sir.” These guys are phenomenal. You’ve got to see what they look like. Everyone’s in perfect shape. I look at him, central casting, every one of them they’re great. Thank you fellas. Thank you.

But I’ll tell you a little story. So Air Force One is a very old plane. It’s beautiful, but it’s an old 747, right? It’s 31 years old and other people didn’t want to do it, but it was time to get a new one. It was time. You got to get a new plane. And actually Air Force One, I’ll give you a little secret, it’s actually two planes. They get two. It’s a hell of a way to travel. If one’s not working perfect, you use the other one. But they get two.

So Air Force One, they negotiated a price and they had it down for $5.7 billion, that was not sounds expensive, and it’s ridiculous, but that was done by the Obama administration. It was done by the Obama administration. And that’s okay. But no administration Obama, Bush, they didn’t want to do it because it sounds luxury. But at some point you got to buy a plane for the country. And these Arab countries would have their beautiful 747, 800s, 900s pour in, and they were gorgeous.

And believe it or not, the new plane is a much bigger plane. Much bigger wingspan, it’s a much more beautiful plane, it’s modern. I think of a 31 years old, Air Force One is 31 years old, the main Air Force One, not this. This is a great plane, but the big one 31 years old. So you’re representing the country, but they didn’t want to do it because it shows luxury.

So I get to the office, I said, whatever happened to Air Force One, how’s it doing?” “Sir, we made a deal for a new one under the Obama administration.” “Oh, you did, good. How much?” “5.7 billion.” I said, “That’s a lot of money for [ 01:24:27] for two planes, in all fairness. Now it’s very technical, there’s a lot of stuff. I won’t talk about it because I don’t want to give away any classified information. Just trust me, some more sophisticated sucker you’ve ever seen in your life.
I think you’re getting into a plane that cost 5.7 billion. Right? But it’s the most sophisticated, two planes. So I said, “How much is it? A general came, and an air force general, great guy, handsome guy. They’re all so good looking these people. I said, “So general, what are we paying? What’s the price?” ” Sir, it’s $5.7 million and we’re ready to go, Sir, could you sign it?” It sounds like a lot of money to me, General, 5.7 million for two airplanes. Can we get a better price?” “No, sir. This was negotiated by the Obama administration. The Obama administration. This was negotiated, Sir, by Barack Hussein Obama.”

And I said, “Oh, that’s good. It sounds very high. So here’s what I’m going to do. Tell Boeing we’re not taking the plane. We have no interest in, it’s too much.” This is what I did. By the way, this is one of many stories. Isn’t this better than going and saying, “I saved your Iron Range?” And I say, “But please remember I did this too.” And I can do away with this stuff, but I did this too. Please remember that because I have all this list of incredible things I’ve done for Minnesota, I won’t even touch it because frankly I’m tired of repeating what I’ve done for all these different states. I mean, I did all this stuff and then I hear I’m nine down. I don’t believe it by the way, suppression. So I said to the general, I said, “General, 5.7 billion, not million, billion. That sounds very high to me general. I bought a lot of planes in my life and a lot of helicopters. I know a lot about it. How could it be five?” “Sir, that’s the best price they could get. We only have one day to do it.” I said, “Cancel it General. Cancel the order.” It was signed actually. “Yes, Sir.”

I said, “Do you have the right to cancel it?” “Yes, sir. I do.” We negotiated a great deal. I said, “Oh good. Cancel it.” “Yes, sir. I’m pleased to tell you something, Sir. We have a breakup fee. We made a great deal, Sir.” I said, “You did? Oh, you have a breakup fee. You mean you can’t just cancel it for nothing? Then cancel it. You don’t have to pay a breakup fee. I know about breakup fees.” “No, Sir, we have a breakup fee.” “Okay. How much is it?” “Sir, we can break it up for $250 million.”

I said, “Wait a minute. So you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs $250 million?” In other words, we give them $250 million, we get nothing. I said, “General, don’t cancel the order. Just tell him I’m very unhappy.” This is what these guys. They’re good businessmen, by the way. These guys, right here, Mike, they might be better than you. I don’t even know. He may be the next governor.

Mike Landell, maybe you should run. You should run. He is my complete and total investment. You should run. He’d be a hell of a governor. At least, you know one thing. Minnesota would be well promoted. Mike, run for governor, please. So he says, “It’s $250 million. It’s 250, Sir, I’m so proud of that.” I said, “You may be proud, but I’m not.” So I said, “General, don’t give them notice because I don’t want to write a check for 250 and getting nothing. I don’t think I could explain that to the American public. So tell them you’re really unhappy, we’re not going to make the deal, but just do it verbally.”

And, “Yes, sir.” And then I spoke to the head of Boeing, a very nice guy. They had some rough times since then. They had a couple of really bad things happen. Terrible, really terrible. This was early on before the problems that they had. But he is, he’s a high quality guy. And I said to him, “Dennis, we have to start it with a… It’s got to have a three on the front of it.”
 
What do I know? I just know that if they’re 5.7, and if I do something with a three. He said, “No, I can bring it down to 5.5 billion.” So I say, “Well, that’s not bad. I save $200 million in about a minute and a half phone call. So so far I’m not good, but it’s not good enough. I’m not happy.” I said, “No, we got to really think about canceling it.” And I can’t go to Airbus, which is made in Europe. It’s a little hard, I got to go to their competitor. I can’t say I’m going to buy the Air Force One from a European company that doesn’t work too well.

My only option was to say, “Look, I just don’t want to just put it aside.” He calls me up a few days later. “Well, we can do a little bit better than that.” I said, “Dennis, has to have a three in front of it, Dennis.” Got to have a three. Like a three, three anything, but got to have a three in front of it. So he said, “No, no, no.” After one month, we signed a contract for $3.9 billion. Same exact one. Actually slightly better, we got an extra generator.

And then Boeing came to me, and I love to negotiate. I do. Got that from my father. My father was a good negotiator and I love to negotiate. So they came to me, “Sir, we can put an extra stairway.” This is the big 747. And remember this is a big, much bigger than the old 747. “Sir, it gets very windy up there. I noticed that your hair’s blown all over the place. But we can buy a stairwell for the plane. And it comes under, it’s like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane.” You’re very high off the ground, big, big thing. “And it opens up, and if it’s raining or windy, you’re covered, Sir, because it’s under the plane. You’re totally sheltered.” I said, “That sounds great. So it’s a corkscrew stairwell.”

I said, “How much is that general?” “50.” I said, “50, what a deal, So for $50,000 I can get a stairway?” “No, sir. $50 million.” I said, “Forget about the stairwell. Forget it.” He said 50. I really thought he meant $50,000. So these are just some little stories. I guess I must like Minnesota to go on one of these deals. But boy, did you get your money’s worth tonight? Is anybody having a bad time?
Did you get your money’s worth? Because you’ve heard the other one. We’ve done this, and we’ve cut your taxes, and we built up the military bigger and better. And we’re the number one in history in regulation cuts, which is the biggest thing. And the judges, which we’ve done at a level like nobody’s ever done, everything we’ve done. Nobody has done more in three and a half years, no administration three and a half. Those first three and a half years, nobody even comes close.

And you know, it’s a funny thing. I say it all the time. I’ve been saying it for a long time and the fake news, nobody even questions me about it. And you know if I was wrong, they would, but they can’t question me because when you see right to try, we took care of our vets. We just got a 91% approval rating from the vets 91. It’s never happened before.

We got choice approved, we got accountability approved, drugs are way down. We’ve got a little setback with this whole situation where these shutdowns cause a lot of problems with drugs, a lot of everything, but drugs were way down. We had our best year in the history of our country last year. And we’re going to have a better year coming up. That’s why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there.
And remember this, and I really appreciate this, thank you. But I appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over Sleepy Joe. What do you like better? Sleepy Joe or Slow Joe? What’s better? Let’s do a poll. We do a poll. We do a poll. I do free falls. You know, these polls, they charge you a fortune for this stuff. They interviewed three people and then they charge you a million dollars.

We interviewed 233 people, I got thousands of people at least for free. What do you like better as nickname? Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe? So let’s go. Wait, Slow Joe first. Okay? So just scream if you like it. So you have a choice, Slow Joe, they’re both very appropriate. Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe, ready? Slow Joe. I think we’re going to have a winner here. Sleepy Joe.

A lot of people say I’m too nice with Sleepy Joe, that I’m actually being too nice, I don’t know. He’s a sleepy guy, but Biden is going to shut down your Iron Range. Remember, it wasn’t just the tariffs I put on your competitors that were dumping iron ore and steel and everything else in our country like it was garbage. And it was garbage steel. It was all [ 01:33:41] based steel, real crap.

It wasn’t that, but when you think of it, they wrote it out. You didn’t have environmentally the right. Somebody said, “Oh, well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries.” It wasn’t that. I opened it up. I signed an order. I signed an executive order because Obama took your Iron Range and Biden took your Iron Range away.

And I’ll never forget. The day I did it, and Tom was there, a man, I don’t know who he is, he’s probably in this massive audience, but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life, including at childbirth. He didn’t cry at childbirth, but he was crying. And he said, “Sir, you gave our life back to us because Obama took our heart out when he closed up the Iron Range.” He said you gave our heart back.

It’s true. So I just want to thank those cities. When a democrat mayor, and we have now a lot of… Now we have additional. So these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us, and it’s a great thing. We’re finding that all over the country. Democrats for Trump. Politicians that got elected as democrats, I don’t think they changed their party affiliation, but they endorsed Trump. They’re all in the Iron Range area.

And Larry Cuffe is here. Larry Cuffe. Where’s Larry? Where is he? Larry, how are you? Why did you do that, Larry? That’s so nice. I appreciate it. Boy, are you good. I wish you had a mic. He said, “Because you’re the best candidate we could ever…” I love this guy. Said you’re the best candidate we could ever hope for.

Thank you Larry, that’s beautiful. I appreciate it. We’ll do a good job. We’re not going to let you down. And they’re doing a good job over there. So dig in, dig in, dig we must, right?
It’s all going because of me. That’s cool, man. Thank you. No, he signed an executive order shutting it down. Just shutting it down. And I hear it’s got the best iron ore anywhere in the world. That’s what I hear. The quality is the best.

… or anywhere in the world. That’s what I hear. The quality is the best. And it’s like an unlimited amount. I’m talking about a little, this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else. And for me, it was very easy. Andrea Zupancich, where is she? Where’s Andrea? Thank you very much. That’s really nice. I’m glad that at least you got a good location, right? That’s great. I appreciate it very much. You’re all friends I guess. Chris Vreeland, where’s Chris? Chris Vreeland. Chris? Where’s Chris? The mayor? Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. Kathy Brandau. Kathy Brandau. Thank you, Kathy. I hope you’re having a good time tonight. We’re not going to let you down. You know that. We’re open. That sucker is open. We’re not closing it.

Well, think of this though. If Biden gets in, it’s closed. He said he’s going to close it. How about this guy? No fracking. You’re not going to frack. Onstage with all these crazy people and they don’t want any energy. They think everything’s going to run by wind, which costs you a fortune, about 20 times more than what we have and doesn’t work. But think of it, all of these people… And they say, “What about fracking? Fracking is the modern technology. And so they all said, “No, no, we’re all against… everyone’s against fracking. What about you?” Yes, I’m against it too. Now he’s against it for months. He gets it, now he’s in favor of it. But he’s sort of grandfathering it. You know, it’s a very weak… Well, I like to grandfather fracking. If I’m a fracker, I don’t want to be grandfather. I want to have it or not have it, right? He wants to grandfather fracking. Always go with their first statement, okay?

So I was in Texas two weeks ago, we had crowds. Mike, we had crowds that went from the airplane to the well, to the drilling well, where we went to see a well. And we saved the industry because I got Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut back 10 million barrels. It actually was probably 18. Ended up being, I think, 18.5 million barrels. And it saved the industry. And yet you’re still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump, but we saved 10 million jobs. But I’m in Texas, and let me tell you, Texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic, there was no demand. There was nobody driving, there was no demand. Nobody ever saw anything like it.

So I’m in Texas and I said to the crowd, it was a great crowd, and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road, on the highways and roadways waving. And they had the most beautiful Trump flags. I wanted to stop, “Where did you buy that flag?” The most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president. Is Mike Pence doing a good job by the way? He did such a great… he worked 29 hours a day. I mean, this guy works day and night. He worked not the 24. He worked 24 plus least five, okay. This man is a worker and he’s a wonderful human being. And when they try it, a guy like Biden that can’t carry his jockstrap. When Biden goes, “Oh, they should have closed one week earlier”, and here’s the guy that said I made a mistake when I banned China that nothing’s going to happen.

It’s so phony. This politics is a very phony business. I haven’t been doing it long. I told one of the senators that came in, he came into my office there, ” I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I’ve won many elections, I’ve only lost twice in my life. I’ve been a Senator for a long time. I know what I’m doing, sir”. I said, “Yeah, and I’ve done it for four years. And I’ve only won one election, but it’s for the president of the United States.” I remember a certain man on television that didn’t like me too much. He said, “They put together the greatest field ever assembled, the Republicans, remember? 17 plus me. They put together the greatest field of talent ever assembled. I hear Trump wants to come in. He’s not going to do it number one. Number two, if he does, he’s just doing it for fun and he’ll be out by September and then he’ll go about leading his life, but he’s not going to do it. But we don’t really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party.”

The greatest talent he’s ever seen. And then I did it and just week after week, one out, two out, three out, four out. And then we’ve done changes. Oh, he said, “He can’t do it because he doesn’t have any experience.” But I actually do on the other side. I contributed to politics. I always found it very interesting. So in a certain way, I had a lot of experience probably. Maybe I had too much experience. That’s why I can tell you about AOC. Check out the $2 million please, check it out, check it out. Check out Omar, check out Omar, get to that great writer, he should get… Oh, so the New York Times won all these Pulitzer prizes, right? I was going to tell you before. All these Pulitzer prizes, these people, and they all got it wrong, right?

They got for Russia, Russia, Russia. We give the Pulitzer prize. I won’t use names. I won’t use names, but we give the Pulitzer prize to the New York Times. They got it wrong. We give the Pulitzer prize to the Washington Post and all of these real sleazebags. I have to be honest with you. Very dishonest people, very dishonest. I call it the Amazon Washington Post. He uses that as his lobbyist because he owns the Washington Post. He gets crap that other people wouldn’t get, okay. That means it’s a lobby. It’s a lobbyist deal. But they got the prize, right? They got the Pulitzer prize. All the guys that got it right, that really got it right, they all got it wrong, totally wrong. And they should return the Pulitzer prize. And Pulitzer association, the committee should ask for those prizes back. They got it all wrong. They were a hundred percent wrong. There was no collusion. They couldn’t believe. Remember the day when it was announced after three years, there is no collusion. I could have told them that a day one, they could have saved 48 million dollars.

They got the Pulitzer. And then you take guys so many, so many. Solomon, Sara Carter, Bongino. How about Dan Bongino? So many, so talented guys. How about that great gentlemen who wrote The Witch Hunt? Remember that? That was the first, right? You know what I’m talking about. He’s fantastic. All great. These people should have won the Pulitzer prize. Now I would say Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs and Laura and Tucker. In all fairness, Tucker was very good. Tucker was great, but these are all people that got it right. Now they don’t do I guess the Pulitzer prize for that stuff, but they probably should. But these guys all got it right. And all they did was get a lot of money because they’re very successful, and that’s okay I guess. But they should give the Pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers, many of whom are back there right now, all of those writers, they should do that.

So just to finish up, just to finish up, I want to just say that we have some great congressmen here. I’d love you guys to come up here because I just want to have you come up. Would you come up? They deserve it. Because I told them, they’re busy guys, that they’re big warriors and all that. And I told them, “I’m going to introduce you right at the beginning. Be here, and then you can get out of here.” They’ve been waiting now for an hour and 20 minutes. Come on up. So just walk to the end, shake their hand. Everybody sign a slip that you’re voting for them, please. They’ve got no problem. But you have members of Congress here, Jim Hagedorn, Tom Emmer, Pete Stauber, great hockey player. And hopefully your next US Senator who’s a man who’s done a fantastic job, run a great campaign, Jason Lewis [ 01:44:25].

And a candidate for Congress, Michelle Fischbach, who’s supposed to be fantastic. And Michelle has my complete and total endorsement. But Jason, you’re in good shape, wow. You’re in better shape than these Congressman Jase. By the way, Jason is fantastic and he’s doing a fantastic… Where’s Michelle? Is she there? Be careful. It’s not worth the broken legs. Look at her. Oh, she’s a warrior, I can tell. Come on up. But thanks, Michelle. And they have my complete endorsement. They’re great people. They love your state. They love our country.

So just in conclusion, I want to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. And you probably heard me today. It used to be Puerto Rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies. And then what happened? They made a lot, they did a good job, and Obama Biden destroyed it. They took away the incentive, all of the taxes. And they took away the incentive and Puerto Rico went down a long way. We’ll get some of that back to Puerto Rico and we’ll get it back for us. Take it away from China. You heard that, yes? They took it away.

And then people automatically vote. It’s like a habit. Will I vote for the Democrat? The Democrat was so bad to you. And how bad were the Democrats to Israel? We did Jerusalem, right? We broke up the Iran deal, right? And then they vote for a Democrat. It’s out of habit, but I think the habits, we’re breaking those habits very quickly. But we’ve helped Puerto Rico and we’ve really helped… If you look at what we’ve done for Israel, it’s been incredible. They say nobody’s done more. And it’s my honor. But we’ll hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which are a disaster. We’ll appoint tough on crime prosecutors. We will nominate judges and justices who interpret the constitution as written. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.

And that’s why the Supreme court is so important. The next president will get one, two, three, or four Supreme court justices. I had two. Many presidents have had none. They’ve had none because they’re there for a long time. They tend to be appointed young. They’re there for a long time. But the next one we’ll have anywhere from one to four. Think of that. That will totally change when you talk about life, when you talk about second amendment, when you talk about things that are so important to you. You’re going to be stuck for 40 years, 35 years, a long time. So this is going to be the most important election, in my opinion, in the history of our country. You got to get it right. Because if you don’t get it right, we will not have a country anymore. You’re not going to have a country. Not as we know it. You won’t have a country anymore.

We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. Countries you’ve never heard of. Coming home. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military mind, and we will ensure peace through strength. This is what we have now. Peace through strength. Remember what I told you about those weapons, we don’t want to use ever, we don’t want to use those weapons. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, January 1st. He doesn’t even have to do anything now. I’ll be so angry if he… They’ll say, “What a job he’s done on transparency, can you believe it?” And he won’t even know what transparency is. And it’s complex. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We’ve done that already. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.

America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And we brought NASA back. NASA, when I got in three and a half years ago, grass was growing through the cracks of the runway. It was over, it was closed. It was nothing. Now it’s the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. You know that the Democrat national convention and the pledge of allegiance at a caucus, two of them, not one. I heard the first one, I said, “Oh, they must’ve made a mistake.” They left under God out of the pledge of allegiance.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now they then said, “Oh, well we didn’t mean that.” They meant it. That’s what they’re going to do. They’re going to take God out of it. Just like I was saying before, Texas, they don’t want God, they don’t want oil, they don’t want guns. I don’t think they’re going to do too well in Texas. Do you agree with that? I don’t think they’re going to do too well in Minnesota either. No, but could you imagine you’re campaigning, and it doesn’t play too well here, but could you imagine you’re in Texas and you have a guy say, “No oil, no God, no guns. Oh, I think I’m going to vote for Joe Biden, everybody.” And then they say, “Texas is in play, it’s a very close…” I have a friend in Texas. He said, “I think you’re winning by 15 points.” These people are crazy. Texas is in play. They don’t want to let you have oil. Think of it. It’s unbelievable. Texas is in play. That’s the fake news back there.

They said it last time too. Remember? Texas, when they say in play, that means it’s too close to call. It’s in play. Too close. We’ve heard that for a long time, in play, right? Too close to call. And they said it four years ago, “Texas is in play. This could be a terrible defeat, losing Texas. Big state, great state. This would be a tremendous defeat.” And they said it about Ohio too. I think we won by like nine points. Right? They said Ohio is in play. Utah’s in play. We won by a lot. Remember we beat a guy named McMuffin. Remember the guy? He was going to take the state of Utah. And then he was going to be able to negotiate. But that didn’t work out. He came in third. Even Hillary beat him. But they said Texas is in play. And I’d go around telling my people, “Damn it, Texas is in play, how the hell? Every time I go there, I have 35,000 people at the stadium, how could it possibly be in play?” They said it’s in play. My people would say, “I don’t think so.”

And we had a big Texas rancher. He was on one of the shows. He was wearing a big, beautiful hat. I wish I could wear those hots. It wouldn’t work for me too well. I don’t think it works for me, right? But it worked for him. And he said, “I don’t know too much about a lot, but I know one thing. Texas is not in play. And this guy is going to win Texas by a hell of a lot of votes.” And that’s what happened that night, the night of the election. The night of the election, they called the results. I’ve been listening for six months, “Texas is so close, we can’t even imagine it it’s so close. This is big.” And they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide, it’s got to be tremendous. And they said, “Texas has closed its doors. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” They didn’t even say the polls were closed. They forgot to say the polls were closed.

I wanted to say. I said, “How come I won?” I called my people, “How could I have won? It was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed.” And I heard from the governor of Texas, great guy, Greg Abbott. I said, “How are we doing compared to four years ago?” We did great four years ago, big, big win. He said, “Sir, you’re doing much better.” But these guys keep saying it’s in play. It’s the same way that I’m down nine points in Minnesota. If I lose Minnesota, if I lose Minnesota, Jason, I’m going to blame Jason if I lose. Boy, we almost had it last time. But we did the right thing. We went to Michigan, we won Michigan, first time in many, many years, that Michigan was won. It’s a great state.

For years you had a president who apologized for America. And now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Minnesota. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. And you know it’s starting today in Minnesota. That’s why I’m here. It started today. Go out of here. You know what? If they’re closed, what the hell time is it now? If they’re closed, just stand in line like you do. People were here two days ago trying to get in here. It’s crazy. So do the same thing at the voting booth, please.
From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Rochester to Duluth, and from Minneapolis, thank God we still have Minneapolis, to right here, right here with all of you great people, this state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were tough and they were strong. You have good genes. You know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it’s about the genes, isn’t it? Don’t you believe? The racehorse theory you think was so different? You have good genes in Minnesota. They didn’t have a lot of money. They didn’t have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith, and they had each other. That’s what you have now. You have each other.

They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their countries, and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we’re going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
And don’t forget, you went through years where you weren’t winning, right? Years and years, they closed down. Even with Obama, he closed that iron. I think he just wanted to get even with you, I don’t know. He wasn’t good. Not a good… We’ve knocked out about 84% of the things he did. Then you say, “I wonder if he likes me?” But you’re getting used to winning and you’re going to see winning like you’ve never seen before. You had your best year and you’re going to win so much. You’ve heard this, right? I haven’t said it in a long time because we’ve been doing a lot of winning, but you’re going to win so much. And you’re going to send Jason to the US Senate. And you’re going to keep winning and winning and winning.

You’re going to win on trade, you’re going to win on the military. You’re going to win on everything you touch. Minnesota is going to keep on winning and you’re going to get tired of winning because Minnesota doesn’t want to win all the time. Your football team is going to win in the big 10 they say, right? No, we are going to keep on winning in Minnesota. And you’re going to get so tired you’re going to say, “Jason, Jason, please, please Jason, go to the president. See him in the oval office. Stop him from winning. We’re winning too much in Minnesota. We can’t stand it. Jason, please, please Jason. Stop him from winning so much for Minnesota. We can’t take it. We’re not used to it because we went through years and years and years where it was tough”, right?

The mayors know that. That’s why they all endorsed the president. And I’m going to look at Jason, I’m going to say, “No, Jason, I’m sorry. The people of Minnesota want to win, you’re wrong, Jason. They want to win. We’re going to keep on going, Jason, we’re going to keep on winning. And they’re going to be happy as hell, Jason.” Get Jason in, he’s a great guy. By the way, you have a Senator that he’s running against. I won’t even mention names. She does nothing, nothing. Nobody even knows who the hell she is. She goes to a meeting the other day, everyone’s trying to figure out who is she? This guy… he even looks the role. Central casting, right? If you can get the look for free, that’s good too. Right? But he’s going to be fantastic. Tremendous guy, really successful. And he loves your state and he loves our country. So Jason, please knock them out. Knock them out.

But you’re going to win. We’re one movement. We’re one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Minnesota, and you know what’s going to be operating at strength? Because I owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me. That was such a nice thing. And I didn’t politick you at all. I never politicked you. I said how nice. And it’s happening with so many other things. We have other endorsements from police forces that I never asked and all of a sudden they’re coming from very hostile territory. So I just appreciate your being here. And I’m saying this for you and I’m saying it for all of you. Okay. Thank you. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Minnesota, thank you.",18/9/20

What a crowd, what a crowd. Get those people over here. See me. Let them come over. What is a big crowd, it’s always big. We want to win. We got to win. We want to save our country from the radical left, the radical left crazies. Thank you very much. And hello, North Carolina, hello, North Carolina. We love you, North Carolina. I’m thrilled to be in Fayetteville with thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots. And you know what’s going to happen in 45 days from now, and you’re watching those polls. They go up, up, up up.
45 days from now, we’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. As we meet tonight, our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her landmark rulings, fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all Americans. You may agree. You may not disagree with her, but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people. I say, all Americans Justice Ginsburg’s close relationship with a friend of ours, a friend of mine, Justice Scalia, is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency, dignity, and respect. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. Thank you very much.

So Article II of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the Supreme Court. I don’t think it can be any more clear, can it? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. What do you think, Thom? Thom Tillis, I don’t think it can be any more clear.
This can only happen in North Carolina.
I hope you hear that back home. Look at all that press. That’s a lot of press. That’s a lot of fake news. Well, I hope they hear. So the chant, this is a new one. Fill that seat. This is the chant. This can only happen to me. Fill that seat. Now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat, right? And that’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to fill the seat.
I love that chant. We hear more chants, there’s a lot of genius in those chants half the time. You said it better than you can say it. You can read a speech. But what’s better than those words, fill that seat. You know what you do? You come up, you say, “Fill that seat,” you leave and you’ve said everything. You don’t have to. There have been 29 times the vacancy opened during an election year or prior to an inauguration. 29 times, that’s a lot. Every single time the sitting president made a nomination. That included, did you ever hear of George Washington? Did you ever hear of Thomas Jefferson? Or how about the great Abraham Lincoln when he wore the hat [ 00:20:13]. With a great hat. I want to try one of those hats. I love that.

No, think of it. 29 times, every single time nobody said, “Oh, let’s not fill the seat.” We won the election. Now then we have some senators that, forget it. Think of it, I won’t say it. I won’t say it, Susan. I won’t say it, Susan. But Thom Tillis is with us. I can tell you that. Great. We have great Republican senators. We have great people and we have a great country. That’s really, we have a great country. And we’re going to keep it that way. So we win an election and those are the consequences. It’s called fill that seat and that’s what we’re doing. The Supreme Court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where, by the way, I didn’t run.

We had a lot of people, a lot of people said, “Oh, he really took a little bit of a shellacking.” Not nearly as bad as others. In fact, we gained seats in the Senate, but they never talk about that. They don’t talk about that. We gained two seats. Nobody talked about it. But we didn’t run. And I had a lot of people that, “Sir, we’ll never vote in 2018.” I said, “No, no vote, everybody vote. They just didn’t. I think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they’ve waited and you see what’s going on. You see what’s happening. You see the enthusiasm that we have. Which, by the way, we set a record in 2016. The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now. Not even close, than we were in 2016.

We are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner of the pandemic. But we’re having them outside. And we shouldn’t say this is some kind of a rally from now on. It’s called a protest. We are protesters. We’re going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these, let’s call them blue states, we want to be nice. We’re going to call it a protest against stupidity. So we are going to have protests against stupidity.

Because a lot of the people like in Michigan and other places, we love Michigan, but the governor’s got them shut down. I hate to say it, your governor’s got you shutdown. It doesn’t look it here. But your governor has got you shut down. I don’t know, you’re not breaking a law by being here. Otherwise, if you are, we’ll have to do something about that because this is a hell of a shutdown. I think your governor has to let this state open up. [ 00:23:21].

And Pennsylvania. Look what they’re doing in Pennsylvania. A great state, that’s actually something very special is going to happen here, in Pennsylvania. That’s a commonwealth. We always have to remember Pennsylvania, commonwealth. Got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble. But we love Pennsylvania. And it’s a shut down. The governor’s got it just shut down nice and tight. And you know what? On November 4th, it’s going to be opened up. Because they’re trying to hurt our numbers. But our economic numbers are so good. They’re staggering. They’re the best we’ve ever had. Jobs, retail, stock, market, everything. And this is with a lot of shutdowns by Democrats. That’s all they’re doing. On November 4th, they’ll announce, “We’ve decided to open up.”

One of the teachers groups said, actually, one of the unions and one of the politicians in California said, “No, we’re not going to do it. We need to do it. We should be open by November 4th.” That was not a good thing for them to say. That person I think was fired, I think was fired. In both the 2016 and the 2018 elections, the American people chose a president and a Senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the Constitution as written. Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters. And that is exactly what we’re going to do. We said that if for any reason, we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy. We’re not going to say, and by the way, we have plenty of time. There’s a lot of time. You’re talking about January 20th.
So we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. I won’t be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. It will be a woman unless, wait, okay, let’s do a poll. Oh, there they are. How many of these have you come to? Speaking of women, how many of, what is this number one? Like 90, they’re great. North Carolina, though. I see them all over the place, they’re great. Anyway, I hope your husbands are okay with it. Are they okay? They’re okay. You have good husbands. But we’re going to do a vote. So I said, I love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as I’m concerned. If we believed in pollsters we wouldn’t be here right now. But we’re actually getting very good. We just had a 53 from Rasmussen, which is very good.

Considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53. History has shown that when you’re at 53 you can’t lose an election. Has anyone ever lost an election with a 53? The answer is yes, when the other side cheats. That could happen, that could happen. That could happen. You saw what happened in Pennsylvania. Some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots. That means I’ll be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time. Yeah, yeah. We’ll be leading, we’ll be winning Pennsylvania. We’re going to win it easy. We’re going to win your state easily.
I just came off the plane with, by the way, our great chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Did anybody ever hear of Mark [ 00:27:39].
And Deb, what a great, she’s doing such a good job. But Mark, just a few months ago, I’ve been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know. Really, I mean really great. Does everyone know Madison? Yes? You’re going to vote for Madison? He’s great. He’s a great guy. But Mark had a beautiful head of black hair and I just noticed that hair’s turning white very fast. But we’re doing a job. We’re very close to a great deal with TikTok, TikTok but nobody cares about that anymore. All they care about is fill that seat, right?

Until about 24 hours ago, that’s all they talked about is TikTok, TikTok. We have a deal worked out, I think with Walmart is going to buy it along with Oracle. Larry Ellison, it’s going to be an incredible combination. And I said, “Do me a favor. Could you put up $5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country, the real history, not the fake history.” Because we’re getting very close to that deal. And all of the technology will be maintained here. They’re going to move probably to the great state of Texas. Sorry, we got you a lot of business when it came… but they’re going to move into the United States, which is what’s important. They’re moving to the United States, unbelievable company. They’re going to have 25,000 jobs. If it all goes, I gave them the preliminary approval.

But they’re putting up $5 billion. And my only problem is they did it so fast. I should have asked for more. What happened is when I suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said, senators, congressmen, women, everybody. They said, “You can’t do that. That’s never been done.” That’s the problem, nothing’s ever been done. And we had other companies, a lot of people wanted it. And I said, “You got to put up $5 million either to the Treasury of the United States maybe or into some education fund or do something.” And they were sort of agreeing with me. They thought it was okay. And then I went to the legal legals here and I said, “They’re going to put up $5 million, give it to the United States.” “Sir.,You can’t do that. There’s no provision.” I said, “How the hell can there be no provision. We’re making the deal possible. Why can’t they give us $5 billion dollars?” That’s b, that’s a lot of money.

Now, watch the crazy Democrats. They’ll go, “They should have gotten more money.” It’s never been done before. They should have, no matter what you do. They should have gotten more. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy. But I’ll tell you. And I said it last night, we had a great rally. Last night, you saw that in a place that we’re going to win. We’re going to win Minnesota. Hasn’t been won since 1972. And they’re all saying, “Well, we did give them back the big iron ore range.” It was, Obama took it away with the stroke of a pen. He put everybody out of work. We gave it back. But I’ll tell you what, we’re going to have a victory on November 3rd, the likes of which you’ve never seen.

Now we’re counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins. Not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later. But in just three and a half years under my administration, we’ve secured America’s borders rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S military, think of that. And I shouldn’t say this and the fake news keeps going, “Oh, he’s given away classified information.” No I’m not. We are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before. And I said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where, “He’s giving away confidential information,” these people are crazy. No, no. I’m just telling you that-

Crazy. No, no. I’m just telling you that President Putin and President Xi of China, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody. They are so envious of what we’re doing. They can’t even believe it. If they know, they perhaps don’t know. Under Obama, they knew immediately, okay. Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA. The likes of which no country has ever seen before. And hope to God, we never have to use them. That’s the key, I don’t ever want to use them. Remember, I was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week. Remember that? Where’s the war? We’re taking them out of Afghanistan. We’re almost finished with that. Working along well. We’re taking them out of Syria, other than I left some behind for the oil, we kept the oil, is it okay that we kept the oil? Is it okay we kept the oil? Let’s go back to my poll. Ready? So we’re putting, I think it should be a woman, because I actually like women much more than I like men, I have to say.

No, I do. I do, I like women more. So I have to make a decision, to fill the seat, as we say, we should have a new campaign. Let’s make a t-shirt, fill the seat. Okay? My people are so good, tomorrow, it’ll be all over the place. That’s a good idea.
That’s a good idea. Fill the seat. Okay watch this, so good tomorrow you’ll see them all over the place, fill the seat. I don’t know how the hell they do it, but they get it done fast. You remember I said, where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? The next day, it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is Hunter? What the hell ever happened? He took the money and he ran I think. Where’s Hunter? He took the money, he went to China, he took 1.5 billion. He had no experience. He didn’t have a job until this guy became vice president. Then he went to China, he got $1.5 billion. I asked the head of a great company, Blackstone. One of the biggest in the world. I said, “Steve, let me ask you a question. Is that possible?” “No, that’s never done.” China doesn’t do that. Well, how did a guy with no experience do this? He said, “Very simple. His father’s vice president.” Is that what you want?

And then Ukraine, $183,000 a month, and a $3 million upfront payment for him and his friends, think of this, with no experience and no job, and they said, do you know energy? It’s an energy company that paid it. Do you know energy? No, I don’t. I’ve not familiar with the subject. Our great Congressman. Right? How the hell does this happen? I think it will be brought up into debate. I think it will be brought up in the debate, I think. Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? You know where Hunter is? He’s probably on the Riviera having a very good time. He’s giving some great energy advice. He’s learning. He’s taking a night class on energy for 180 grand. Where is Hunter? They’re corrupt. Remember Joe with a prosecutor? $ 1 billion, I’m not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said, that crazy company over in Ukraine. $1 billion. I’m not giving it. You get them out. And guess what? They got them out. Here’s your billion dollars. Now that’s called quid pro quo. Right? That’s the real deal.

With us, there was none. They made it up. Remember when Shift made the phony speech? Eight times he said the same thing, except that’s not what happened. Fortunately, we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word, every word. I’m glad we had them because we’re dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people. So women and men, ready? Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court or would you rather have a man? Ready? A woman or a man. So, would you rather have me choose, this is a very scientific poll. Actually, it’s a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed, then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don’t interview the people. They sit behind their desk. Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court? Yes, woman. Yes?
What’s going on? Let’s give it one more quick chance. This is a free poll. And this is a lot of people. This is tens of thousands of people. This is a lot of people. You know, the fake news, they’ll say, “He had a smattering of people.” If Bernie Sanders had a crowd. Oh, he had a massive crowd. It was so big. With me, my crowds are five times bigger than Bernie’s. And they’ll say, “He had a smattering of people.” They were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of. Thousands. If those people, come on, bring them over. What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over. Come on over. You got thousands of people behind these people. I would imagine the sight lines aren’t too good. You have stands in front. Okay. So one more time. Who would rather have a man on the Supreme Court? Who would have a woman on the Supreme. Now tomorrow, like fake news, CNN, he was playing games with the United States. It is a terrible thing he’s done. No, I’m just taking a poll, please. And by the way, that’s a very accurate poll, because that’s the way I feel. It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman. Who I haven’t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list. I built this incredible list of brilliant people. And we’re asking for Biden’s list. He can’t give it. You know why? Because if he ever gave a list, he’d either put somebody in the left middle, which would be okay. You could get votes, or he’d put one, somebody, which is what he’s going to choose, so far left, now, if he did the left middle, he loses his entire left coast. Right? And if he loses the left coast, that’s the end of his election. And last time, remember how many people I got from Bernie, because of trade.

A lot of the Bernie people vote for us because Bernie is right about one thing, trade. But Bernie took a bad defeat, didn’t he? It was a bad loss. He’s one of the most gracious losers I’ve ever seen, he is. All Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas had to do is leave. If she left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every one of those States, but they split up that vote. That’s too bad, but we have Sleepy Joe, we’ll see how that works out. I think it’s working out pretty good. We were winning so much, we didn’t even have, we could have called off the election. We were winning by so much, and then the plane came in from China. And in many ways, I had to go back to work, but I had to go back to work on this one too. And now we’re going up and up and up and we’re winning and we’re winning all over the place. Because I happen to think, I just say what I want. And you know, they make up a lot of false stories. They will make up a lie. Like what I said about military. Can you imagine? No animal would say that. They make it up and then they put it in ads. So once they did that, the only good thing is I can say, I said, “Now I can say anything.” He is the worst candidate, the dumbest of all candidates, but he was dumb in prime time, as told to me by a Senator from long ago, he said, “Who’s the dumbest in the Senate, who’s the smartest in the Senate?” The smartest is, I won’t tell you. But the dumbest is Joe. I said, “Who’s Joe.” He said, “Joe Biden.” That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. If I lose to him, I don’t know what I’m going to do. I will never speak to you again. You’ll never see me again.

No, how do you lose? He is honestly, I go up and these guys are grilling me all the time. Stephanopoulos grill, grill. Okay. It’s all right. It’s okay. I think it came out very, well it’s always, it comes out well. You have to be able to answer. They’re very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries, leaders of foreign countries. But I say he’s always using a teleprompter. I don’t care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me? That means the fake news is giving him the questions. So that’s what really… they never gave me the questions. If I ever said, in fact, I’m going to say it now. I want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me. And I’m going to read the questions off the teleprompter, and the questions are so easy. Did you see Anderson Cooper? He’s a nice guy. He’s interviewed me over the years, a lot, but he’s a tough interviewer.

Did you see those softballs? What do you think Donald Trump is a very bad human being. Do you agree with that? Yes, I do, Anderson. I’ve never seen softballs, and actually they’re getting hit by it. They’re getting hit by it. It’s just a terrible thing. I mean, this is a guy, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1%. In fact, he actually had 1% with an arrow pointing left. That means less than one. Now he’s shot, he’s got half of his head left, and he’s out, think of it. He’s totally shot. And he ends up getting the nomination. He couldn’t get it in prime time. What the hell is going on with the world today? What’s going on? What’s going on with the world, Mark Meadows?
Unbelievable Meadows, oh boy. He’s a smart guy, Meadows, great, great guy, North Carolina, in just three and a half years, we obliterated the ISIS caliphate. Remember when I had it down to 99%, they said, “You got to finish it.” I said, “Let somebody else finish it.” And we went, and we finished it. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, which we have. China’s now paying us billions and billions of dollars. But you know, I view it differently now, I view China much differently now, after the plague came in, I view it differently. And we brought your jobs back home to North Carolina and our contract. In three years of President Trump, real median household income rose by almost $7,000. Now think of that, three years, three years, right? Achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. This is in three years. Under 16 years of presidents, Barack Hussein Obama, ladies and gentlemen, is President Barack Hussein Obama, or as Rush Limbaugh, the great, how great is Rush? Do we love Rush? As Rush Limbaugh would say, Barack Hussein Obama.

You ever hear Rush? Barack Hussein Obama. Rush is great. He’s doing well too. He’s great. He’s a tough guy. We love Rush. We love you Rush. He watches every one of these rallies. You know, he supported me when I came down with our great first lady, I came down the escalator. I made a speech. I didn’t even have a speech writer, I had to wing it. The winging speeches are the best ones like last night. But Rush said, “I like that guy. I’d never heard that before. I’d never heard we’re going to build a wall.” We’re going to have secure borders. We’re going to make new trade deals that are like sane. We’re going to do all the things we’re going to rebuild our military. We’re going to have a strong country again. We did so many things, and Rush heard this. I didn’t know Rush. I mean, maybe I met him once, twice, for two seconds. And he became an instant fan of Trump. And he was for a long time before I even got to know him. And he’s been so important, he’s the King, 39 million listeners. There’s nobody like him.

Try sitting down for what is it? Three hours? And talking, just talking with everyone. 39 million people, often. Try sitting. We love Rush. I love Rush. But listen, try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening, and talk for three hours without phone calls. Phone calls are easy. Hey, what do you think of this? What do you think. Just talk. Talk. And everybody finds it fascinating. And it is fascinating. I wish I had time to listen more often. It’s a little tough as president, but everybody finds it fascinating. And we gave Rush, because he’s such an important person and done such an incredible job the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And Catherine, his wife is great. What a couple. But Rush has been unbelievable. He’s so on our side. And he was from literally day one, right from the beginning.

And we don’t have to mention Sean, and Laura, and so many others. We don’t have to mention Lou, the great Lou Dobbs, right? I mean, Lou Dobbs said, Lou started years ago, and he liked us from the beginning. He said, “Donald Trump is going to be a very good president.” Okay. That was the first little time. Then he went, “Donald Trump. I love Donald Trump, but he’s the best since Ronald Reagan.” Then he went, “Donald Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.” So that was about a year and a half into it. Then the great Lou Dobbs said, “Donald Trump may be the greatest of all time. Greatest of all time.” And then somebody said, “Can I ask you Lou, when you say the greatest, does that include Abraham Lincoln and George Washington?” He said, “Absolutely. He’s now the greatest of all time.” So we love Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is great. Go out and buy his book. His book is great. But we have great support. We have great support.

Tucker’s been very good lately, I have to tell you. Tucker has been very good. Tucker Carlson, he’s come a long way, actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history. He’s very strong in that, we took care of that very powerfully, very powerfully. We signed an executive order. We fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff, that were getting paid a lot of money that we’re here for a long time. Under 16 years of presidents Obama and Bush, the median income only rose $2,900. Now think of that. So three years, it went up $7,000, 16 years, it went up less than $3,000. I’d say that’s a big difference. And that’s not including energy, because look what you’re paying for your gasoline now. Right? Remember those days? Remember those days of $5, you said, “Let’s get rid of that big truck.” Now you’re all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible. You know why? Because gasoline is so damn cheap, right? Remember the $5 days? Now you’re below $2 a lot, right? Below two. I mean, they’re seeing numbers that nobody believes.

It’s all good stuff. And we’re energy independent. So many things have happened. If you add four or $5,000, so you’re talking about by $11,000, you got to add the energy. I said to my people, “Put the energy in.” “Well, I don’t know if it’s right.” I said, “Do me a favor, just put it in.” In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in American history. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we’re doing it again, and we’re doing it very rapidly. This is a super V. They said, “Oh, I don’t know, V is going to be very hard.” No, this is a super V. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year. It’s already in very good shape. Very, very good shape. In a matter of weeks. We will end the pandemic from China. We will end our plague from China. Next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country, it’s heading that way.

If you take a look, automobile manufacturing, housing, retailing, they’re all setting records, they’re through the roof, hard to believe, actually, during the rounding the corner, when I say rounding the corner, they go crazy. They want to keep it going as long as possible. If you say anything positive, they say, “He’s not telling the truth to the American public.” I am actually telling the truth. You know these people, they talked about, because I said, “Well, Winston Churchill was a great leader.” They said the other night, “You said Winston Churchill was a great leader, but he didn’t lie.” Because this guy, Woodward. He writes a book. He’s had it. He’s another one shot. I compare him sort of to Biden. He’s sharper than Biden, I have to say that, but he’s shot. He’s tired. He’s exhausted. I never saw a guy be able to do so much television, try doing a book on somebody else. See how much television time they give you, like none. But they said the other night, and it was amazing. Winston Churchill.

They said, “He didn’t lie to the people, to Britain. He didn’t lie.” I said, “Well, let me ask you this. He stood on buildings when the Nazis, Hitler, were bombing London.” That’s pretty brave, because he may have been doing a little drinking, but he was known for that, right? He’s got a right to, but it’s true. He stood in the buildings in London, as they were bombing London, and made speeches, and made statements, and had everything. And he’d sometimes have press conferences. And the fake news wouldn’t show up. He was standing there, nobody was in front of him. But he would stand there, and he would say, “You are safe. You are safe. Everything is okay. You are safe.” Well, that’s a lie, I guess, right? So I said, “Oh, I never thought of it that way. I guess he lied.” No, he’s a great leader, and he was leading, and he was a great, great prime minister. He did a fantastic job. Not lying.

No. We love our country, we want to lead our country, and we can’t let a thing like this, this is a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the world it happened, should have been stopped in China. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, should have been stopped in China. To defeat the China virus, we launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II. Somebody said, “What grade would you give yourself?” I said, “A+.” But I would give myself a D, I would say I would give myself, and my whole group, because Mike Pence is great, Mike Pence really was. He worked so hard. And it’s unfair, he worked so hard. The ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics now we have, look at what’s happening. When somebody gets very sick, look how we bring them back so often, compared to what it was originally. I mean, the work that’s been done, and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with what’s going on. But the Democrats don’t want the vaccine. They don’t want it. At first, they wanted a vaccine, because they didn’t think it could happen.

Now that we have it, they’re going like, “Well, we don’t want it.” It’s the craziest thing. Think of it, you want to get a vaccine, and they’re willing to hurt people, let people die for political reasons. Think of it.
I think, honestly, I think it’s a disgrace. But we surged rapid testing kits. We have more testing than all other, I mean, practically everybody. You look at number two is India. They have 1.5 billion people. We are up 50 million tests more than India. In fact, we’re about to crack 100 million tests. And when you test, then you have, does this make sense? Then you have cases. So we do all this testing, and I come home and I turn on NBC News. It is so bad.
I think NBC, that’s not only MSDNC. I think NBC with Lester Holt. There’s another beauty. Hi Lester. How do you feel big in second place Lester? He surged from first place to second place. But NBC News is so, I mean, it’s just terrible. They use free airwaves, and then they give you fake news. Free airwaves. They should pay a lot of money for this. This is not right. NBC. It’s owned by a company called Concast, C-O-N, Concast, they’re con, they’re con men. It’s a disgrace. They spend fortunes on public relations and then I get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world, I guess. Yeah, the world, it’s all over the world. And I say Concast, and immediately, there goes their public, how’s your public relations doing NBC? Not too good. But they’re just… they don’t tell the truth. Our country would be so much better off if we had honest media, really. Really would. And do you see what their approval rating has gone to? I think it’s one of my greatest achievements.
Hey look-
It’s a Saturday night. We have all night. This happened last night in Minnesota. I have these teleprompter people, they’re great, they’re genius. And I was about 45 minutes into the speech, and I realized I was only on line two. And he was like, “What do I do?” But we have more fun. Hey, you now have a president that doesn’t have to use a teleprompter, isn’t that nice? And I said last night, I said, and yeah, your friends were there. The Congressmen. By the way, is the media now, and I’m pretty sure it’s getting close. I think they have a lower approval rating than Congress. Congratulations. No, but it’s hard. When you’re sitting there, you’re in businesses, you’re in construction, you drive trucks, you do a lot of things. You’re in offices. You don’t realize, because you don’t know what’s happening. I know exactly a true story. And then it’s written to totally bend the truth, to make a good thing into a bad thing. Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes.

No, but think of it. No but think. And they didn’t cover the story. Now Obama got his the first week. Very liberal group, and nobody knew what the hell he got it for, and he didn’t know. Why did you get it? I don’t know. Remember? I don’t know. I have no idea. But you know, you have a president, you love your president, and your president gets honored, because I’m not being honored, you’re being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, for Israel, what we did with Israel.
I went home and I said to the First Lady, “Darling,” she’s very popular. She made a great speech, right? And Ivanka made a great speech, right? But I went home. I said, “Darling, I have big news tonight. Let’s turn on the television.” You know, we don’t use wind. We use actually, we actually use petroleum. We use Petro. Because we like it to be on like a lot. We don’t like to have lots of open gaps when the wind’s not blowing. We can’t watch President Trump. I go home. I say, “First Lady, a great thing happened today. I was honored, Nobel Peace Prize, nominated. This is a big thing First Lady.” And then I went home two days later. I said, “First Lady, you’re not going to believe it. I was honored again. Nobel Prize, that’s Kosovo.” Israel, Kosovo. I said, “First Lady, this is great news. Let’s turn on the television. This is going to be big. This is going to be big tonight. We just got honored, this is big.” Nobel Peace, can you imagine? You grow up in Brooklyn, Queens, and now you’re getting the…

“First Lady, let’s turn on the television. Let’s turn onto that fake NBC news.” And I see we have a storm. “Okay, First Lady, don’t worry about it. The storm is big. We have it taken care of, FEMA’s down there, Florida, Alabama, Georgia. We got FEMA down there. It’s being taken care of. We always take care of it. We take good care of it.” Texas, Louisiana. We took good care of him two weeks ago. “All right First Lady, don’t worry about it. It’s the next story, I’m sure, it’s the Nobel Prize for peace.” We’re stopping mass killings between Kosovo and Serbia. They’ve been killing each other for so many, they’re going to stop killing. I said, fellas, let’s get together. They’d been doing it for hundreds of years, frankly, under different names. I said, that’s great. And with Israel, UAE and Bahrain signed a deal with Israel. Everybody said it couldn’t be done.

I said, “All right, First Lady, that’s the first story on NBC, but don’t worry. That’s a big story. The floods are big. I see it.” And then there was a second story about something. And then their third story is about something with me, I don’t know, something bad they found out. Then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth. I said, “First Lady, I’m a little embarrassed. I thought we’d do a little better.” And then they looked at the screen, and said, “Good night.” And I wasn’t covered. I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination. And they didn’t cover it. And then the following day I watched a certain show that does like us, and they said, “Would you believe, that they covered, and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing. That was 18 minutes. And the Peace Prize Nobel version, zero time for President Trump. Thank you very much fake news media, we appreciate it.
And when Obama got it, here are the headlines. President Obama gets the Nobel Prize.
We need an honest media. The free airwaves, they lie over the free airwaves. They use them and they lie. I don’t know. We’re going to have to look at it. They’re a bunch of scoundrels. They hate it when I say it, but you know, honestly, they are the enemy of the people. When they lie, they are the enemy of the people. You are the enemy of the people. Oh, damn it. The red lights just went off. One, two, three, there’s one back there, there’s one back there, probably, oh it’s OAN, thank you OAN. Every time I get on this subject, they cover me not because they want to, but we get great ratings. We get ratings. These little deals that we have here, come on in folks, come on in. Look at these people.
But you know what? I’ll tell you what, it’s true. They cover it because… But anytime I start talking about the fake news media, you see them getting a little tentative. The camera starts to shake a little bit, and you know, there’s another thing. Look at this crowd. It’s as far as the eye can see, it’s a big crowd, right? They never cover it. I said to my wife last night, we had this incredible crowd. A lot of people, thousands and thousands. I mean like 25, 30,000, many people outside couldn’t get it. It was like a sea of people. My wife said, “Was it a large crowd?” I said, “Did you watch?” “Yes. But they only show your face.” And I saw people they never show. And that includes Fox, which has changed a lot, changed a lot, sad. Somebody said, “What’s the biggest difference between 2016 and now?” You know what I said, “Fox.” Biggest difference. Biggest difference. I don’t know what’s going on with them. But we have some great ones too on Fox.

We surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in America. We learned a lot, through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate by 85% since April. Think of that? 85%. We’ve come up with things. They’re waiting to see what’s coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics, which to me is even more important than the vaccine. You go into the hospital, you make people better. You give them a shot, you do a transfusion. You make people better. They walk out, that’s to me even better, but ultimately long-term, those vaccines are going to be great, and they’re really working out well and it’s going to be really soon. The people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible, as long as possible. They’re going to try and give Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesn’t even know what a…

It’s possible. They’re going to try and get Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesn’t even know what a vaccine is.

Europe is almost 30% higher excess mortality than the United States. Does anyone know that? they don’t report that, right? Europe? Europe’s had a hard time. I’m not looking to hurt them, but they have 30% higher.

Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.3 million jobs, and a wonderful place called North Carolina, right?

When I banned travel from China in January, Sleepy Joe Biden called it, “That’s hysterical. That’s xenophobic.” What does that mean? Tell me what xenophobic means, Sleepy Joe.
Who said that? I mean, you’re my friend. Who said it?

All right, what a voice. Have you ever tried opera? What a voice, did everybody hear that?

That’s true. I wouldn’t say it.

She said, “He has no idea where he is.” But I would never say it. I won’t say it.
I won’t say it. I refuse this.

No, but don’t underestimate him. Look, he’s been doing this for 47 years, and I got a debate coming up with this guy. No, it’s true.

You never know, you never know. They give him a big fat shot in the ass, and he comes out, and for two hours, he’s better than ever before. Problem is what happens after the … No, we’re going to ask for a drug test, we are.

I’d like to have a drug test. Both of us. I’ll take it, he’ll take. Because I watched him into debates with all those people, those Democrats. The one who treated him worst was Kamala. Actually, also, she was the one that treated, you know that, she was the one that treated him so badly. And she treated Kavanaugh very badly too.

Nobody was ever ruder, nobody ever suffered, like Justice Kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people. The way he was tortured was disgraced. And they had nothing.

Those women, that was all made up. Most of them have already admitted, it was all made up lies, false accusations, and they made him suffer. And the leader of the pack I would say was, Kamala was the worst, and Pocahontas was a close second.

How’s Pocahontas doing, since she destroyed Bloomberg? How about Bloomberg? Did he get killed?

Now he’s trying to come back. He’s trying to buy his way back into the Democratic Party. “I’m going to put up $100 million in Florida, we’re going to go,” he wants to be back so badly. Here’s a guy who spent $2 billion, it’s almost two billion now, they’re finding out. He had some of the dumbest advisers, people I know, some of the dumbest people. If he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads, he could have won. He could have won.

Unfortunately, he said, “No, I want to debate.” He went and sued to get into the debates. That was not a good lawsuit. They settled by saying, “We’ll let you in the debate.” The first question, he was destroyed.

You would think that, the way the Democrats treated him, he would really come to me, and he’d say, “I want you,” but his hatred and jealousy … He wanted to be President, but he doesn’t have the capability of being President.

But he’s going down now to Florida, he’s going to spend $100 million. How good … I have to say this, I’m not a fan of Elizabeth Warren. I gave her the name Pocahontas, I thought that was the end. Remember what I used to say about her?

She has … Oh, well, you know it. You know. I would just, look, I said, “This is not an Indian.” She said, “I’m an Indian.” You remember what I said? “I have more Indian blood than me, I have more in me than she has, and I have none.”

Unfortunately, I’d like to have some. I would like to have some. I think it could help, it might make me better, but I have none. And I said, “I have more than she does.” And then she went out to, and she choked, remember that?

She went out, and she took a test. And it found out that about 700 years ago, there was a possible event, 1,024th, right? Wasn’t that it? Good memory, very good memory. Trump has a good memory.

Good moment. Not for that, but for a lot of things.

Now, 1024th, which meant many, many, many centuries ago, there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line. But she choked. We forced her into a choke. She went down like a rock, and then she started coming up, up, up, up, up. Then she totally destroyed Mike Bloomberg.

We call him Mini Mike. Remember? Mini Mikey wants that platform. “I want a platform, damn it.” I don’t mind. Oh, boy, he was pathetic, but now he’s going to try and buy his way back into the Democrat party.

Who was the other guy, the other rich guy? He just kept spending money. What was his name? [ 01:09:26].

You remember that guy? Great environmentalist. Except he made his money with coal, which is okay, I think coal is good. Clean coal, I like clean coal.

If we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. You know that. He was way behind. This was months later. And then I watch him last night, reading something saying that, I opened, I closed it up, one week later, one week.

Two months later, he was talking about the fact that I shouldn’t be doing that to China. I shouldn’t be banning China because I was xenophobic. And it’s just unbelievable. And now they will say anything. It’s called disinformation. They will make up a lie, they will make up a story, and they go with it, it makes no difference whether or not it’s show, and they’ll take ads. It’s the worst group of people.

He’s surrounded by bad people, dishonest people, but they’re very smart. He’s not smart. They keep him from talking. It’s actually, if he wins, it’s the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world.

Because they took a man who’s got nothing. He didn’t have it, but he’s got nothing, and I will give them credit. The single greatest campaign in history, if he wins, but you know what? If he wins, North Carolina is screwed, and so is every place else.

And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers. I gave the farmers $28 billion. Thank you very much, Presidency. $28 billion. Because you were targeted, right? You were targeted by China. And I said, “How much were the farmers,” Iowa, Nebraska, you, all of them? You were targeted.
 
I said, “How much?” Sonny Perdue, I said, “How much, Secretary?” 12 billion, then 16 billion, you were targeted. I took it out of the tariffs we charge. We never took 25 cents in from China, now we’re getting billions and billions and billions of dollars.

And I took just a small part of it. $28 billion. That’s a lot of money, but it was a small part of what we’ve got. They can’t believe it. So who do you think China would like to see win? [ 01:11:33]

Sleepy Joe, that never gave, never took anything, or Trump, misjudging him? So Mexico, we’re driving them a little crazy. They don’t like Trump too much. But now Biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine. His campaign campaign’s really reckless. And all it is is for political reasons. It’s political reasons.

Biden, his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown. We’re getting better, we’re really coming along, and he’s talking about shutting down. We’re not doing any shutdowns. We don’t need shutdowns. Maybe a little area, if it’s such a spike, we understand, we have to take care of our senior citizens.
This guy talked, he said, “Well, I’ll do whatever my medical people want. I believe in science.” He doesn’t know what science is. “I believe in science.” No, we’re not doing any shutdowns. We don’t need, we’re rounding the turn. Without the vaccine, we’re rounding the turn. With the vaccine, it’ll just speed it up.

That’s another one that will be controversial. They’ll say, “He’s saying that it’s happened.” Yeah, without the care, without the vaccine, it’s going along. With a vaccine, even better. It’ll be faster.

Biden’s own chief of staff said, when they manage the H1N1 that he calls the N1H1, right? He goes, “the N1H1,” and that’s an easy one, because H comes before, but he always gets it wrong.

It’s like, seven times, “It’s great to be with the great people of Iowa.” They’ll say, “Sir, you’re in Idaho.” “Oh.” I’ve never made that mistake so far. But I always say, “If you do, just leave the stage, because you can never recover.”

You can speak as well as, I mentioned, Winston Churchill, even though he was a great speaker, he was a stutterer, and he became one of the greatest speakers ever. You could be Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake, just leave the stage. You can’t recover.

But he’s made it oftentimes, right, in New Hampshire, and it was Vermont. The worst, I think, I think there was one, he was in Ohio, and he said he was in Florida, right? But he couldn’t find any palm trees.

We just got a poll from Ohio. Through the roof. Great state of Ohio, good Governor, great state of Ohio. But when they managed the H1N1 swine flu, this was from his top person that ran it. “We did every possible thing wrong. 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it was just a total disaster.”
 
He basically said, “We didn’t know what the hell we were doing.” And this is the guy that’s going to tell us what to do with something that’s much more lethal, much more lethal. This is much more lethal than the swine flu.

If H1N1 had the same fatality rate as the China virus, over two million people would have already perished. They didn’t know what the hell they were doing. And the guy admitted it. That guy can not be very popular in Democrat politics right there.

But just to remember, and he’s telling us how to do things. We’re building ventilators, we’re the ventilator capital of the world now, think of it. We’re sending them to other countries, we have so many.

And we have made a lot of Governors look very good. And they all admit it, until the press comes in front, where they say, “Oh, he was okay,” but we took care of them. We took care of Governors, we took care of the states.

On November 3rd, North Carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns. These are all things that he said.

Shut down our economy, destroy the suburbs. They were saying that women in the suburbs, they’re not sure if they like me. They’re starting to like me a lot lately, because it’s law and order. They want law and order. Thank you. A suburbanite, thank you, thank you.

No, it’s true. I don’t know. But I heard the same thing four years ago, remember? ” Women will not vote for him.” Then we win the election, it’s like, they’re all in shock. Well, what took place? “Well, he did very well with women,” what the hell was that all about, right? Did very well. Women were great.

Hey, we were way above everything. African American, we did great, Hispanic, we did great. Have you seen African American and Hispanic American numbers? If it holds true, we will have set a record for a Republican, which is [ 00:12:29].

Now, if it holds true … There a lot of jobs, a lot of jobs, a lot of great thinking, but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens. Now, what that’s going to do is destroy our country, because two things happen. Number one, we can’t afford it. Number two, everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that.

Right now, they’re saying, wherever they are, when you say, “We’re going to give you free education, we’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to take care of you. Everything’s going to be perfect. We’re going to give you, every single family,” now watch, they’ll print this. “We’ve checked it out, and he lied about this.”

Every single family is going to be given a brand new Silver Cloud Rolls Royce. Now, I said that, and CNN went, “He lied about the fact that they’re not getting a Rolls Royce.”

Remember what I said? ” Russia, if you’re listening,” in front of this message, “Russia, if you’re listening, find out where her e-mails,” or whatever. And then, everybody laughed, I laughed.

Well, they actually play it all the time. “When he spoke to Russia.” Do you ever see it? And they cut it off before the end, they don’t see any, I said, “Russia, if you’re listening …” Oh, these people are sick.

He wants to erase your borders. Yeah, that was supposed to be a joke, right? It was a joke. It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second. He wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in education. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I am launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called, 1776 Commission. It’s already done.
And it’s true, your kids come home, and they tell you things. How many of you, the kids come home, and they tell you things. It’s a disgrace, what they’re teaching them, it’s a disgrace. We’re ending it. In fact, we’re taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things, bad things, actually.

We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. And we are getting better every single day. And no party can lead America, that will not teach our children to love America. No party can do that.

The sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down America and our way of life. We have a great way of life, and getting better all the time. Look at what we’ve done.

Biden’s running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail, including one who attempted murder. That’s right. One who attempted to murder a police officer, and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, 13 members of Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. Look, that’s where they’re coming from, just so you know.

He’s trying to go a little bit more right, like the fracking. “Oh, well of course, we’re going to have …” For six months, he’s saying, there’ll be no fracking, which I don’t think the people in Pennsylvania thrilled with, do you agree, considering that your taxes could quadruple.

I tell it all the time, Texas, right? Texas, they like oil. They like guns, right, in Texas. Right? And they like God. So he comes out with a platform, no oil. We don’t want oil. This is during the Democrat deal.

There’ll be no oil, there’ll be no God, there’ll be no guns. This is not a good campaign. And then the fake news says, “Donald Trump is tied in Texas.” I’m tied. Last time I was tied in Texas until the day of the vote. Then they announced, the second they called it, “The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.”

Think of it. He’s against oil. He’s against guns. They’re going to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment’s going to be destroyed. I am holding up your Second Amendment. If it’s not me, look what I’ve done. You think it’s been easy?

They want to get rid of the Second Amendment. They’re going to get rid of the guns, right? And religion. So, look what they’re doing to religion. These states, everything’s closed, except, you’re allowed to protest. That’s why I say everything we do is a protest.

Look at all those people back there, look at that. Look it, they just form. Wow. Turn the cameras around, please. They never do it. Turn the cameras around, please.

Wow. Thank you. That’s a lot of people. We’re proud of you. That’s a lot of people. You ever notice, they never do it, though.

I say, “Turn the camera.” Right from the beginning, they never did. They don’t want to give us the credit for these big crowds, because you know what?

When you see crowds like this, or in Wisconsin, that I had a few nights ago, or last night was so incredible. What we had last night was just incredible, in Minnesota. We’re going to win it, 1972, we’re going to win it. 1972, it hasn’t … That’s a long time ago. Remember?

I think Reagan won every state except for Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota. What we’ve done for them, we’ve opened up their livelihood again.
 
Maine. How about Maine? I opened up 5,000 square miles of ocean. Obama closed it. They said, “Why? He had no idea.” Right off their shore, no fishing, no nothing. They called it a monument, right? Right off their shore.

Maine, I mean, if I don’t win Maine … Maine traditionally is not really very Republican, but I won Maine too last time, actually. Because I love Maine, too. I love Maine, too. But think of what I did.

I opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women. Now they go lobster fishing and fishing. But 5, 000, I said, “Why did they close it?” Nobody was able to tell me, but I opened it up, an executive order. I totally opened it up.

I did many other things. Then I got the tariffs. They couldn’t do business in European Union, they couldn’t do business in China, because they were charging tariffs to Maine. So Canada would take our fish and lobster. We’d sell it to Canada for nothing, and they’d sell it to China and Europe, because they didn’t have to pay tariffs.

Not only did I get the 5,000 … Think of what, 5,000 square miles. So you take one mile, square mile, multiply times 5,000. That’s a big area, even in an ocean, right? It’s massive. And it was the best area, the best. I got rid of the tariffs.

I told them, “If you tariff our Maine lobster people, and fishermen and women, if you want a tariff on them, that’s okay, but we’re going to tariff your cars, okay?” Which is a much bigger deal. It was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off.

I did that off of Maine, I did that in two weeks, okay? Took me two weeks. Once I found out about it, it’s hard to believe it ever happened. So I did that for Maine. And somebody said, I’m down in Maine. How the hell can I be down in Maine, after what I did?

I’ll tell you what if I do that from Maine, and if Maine doesn’t vote for Trump. I don’t think I’m going back, okay? I can tell you one thing. Their Senator never did it for them.

Joe Biden and the Democrats want to gut police departments nationwide. You know that, right? Here in North Carolina, nearly 50 Democrat State House members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding, endangering your families.

I was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state, and we’re joined by many of them tonight. Where are they? Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you, folks. Thank you. Thank you.
You got to take care of our law enforcement. We got to take care, nobody can do the job like them. We have to let them do their job. We’ve got to stop this nonsense, this child’s play, we’ve got to stop, they’re great.

You know, I was endorsed by, think of this, New York’s finest. It’s very tough. You know, de Blasio’s your mayor, he doesn’t have a clue what’s happening, either. I think Sleepy Joe’s worse, do you want to know the truth? Because this other guy has just an ideology that’s just terrible.

But de Blasio is there, and New York’s finest, first time they’ve ever endorsed a Presidential candidate, they endorsed me, three weeks ago. That takes courage. Think of it. Chicago, the police in Chicago, they could do their job. We don’t even have to bring in the National Guard. Whenever we do, it takes about 30 minutes, it’s over, right? Like we did in Minneapolis, 30 minutes.

Remember that beautiful scene? They lined up, they went down, there was no social distancing in between these great, tough guys. There was no social distancing, Tom Tillis. They went down and they had $250,000 outfits. They had more crap on that helmet with night goggles. And these guys were sort of wise guys, right? They were shouting at them, screaming at them. They were screaming at the wrong people. They went down, they never had to stop. It was just forward.

It all ended. It all ended in Minneapolis. It took, you also had, what? A half an hour? Remember, they hit the CNN reporter in the knee? He went down, Ali Velshi. He said, “This is a friendly protest. It’s wonderful to see such a …”

Behind him, it was all fire for a block. It looked like Berlin during the war. “This is a friendly …” What are they doing? How does that help to be like that? How does that help?

We’re joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me. One man who, especially over the last year, he has been so great, he couldn’t be better.

And I think he’s doing very well. I’m looking at some numbers, and you’re doing very well. And I think your opponent has some very big problems. Senator Tom Tillis. Thank you, Tom. Thank you.

He’s been great, smart guy. And he’s got a couple of bills that he’s putting in, one in particular, I love it. You got to do it. That if a sanctuary city causes problems, you can sue the sanctuary city, you can sue.

Will you get, we got to get that one moving, right? That’s moving along, right? That’s a great one.

A man who, I just did a phone call for the other night, and the people love him. He’s in a rough district, but he’s now leading. I see you’re up in the polls, Congressman Richard Hudson, great guy.

Where’s Richard? Great guy. He’s a warrior.

And two people I really liked, because we fought like hell for them a year ago, right? And they had guts, and they had what it takes. They didn’t choke. You know, a lot of people choke. They choke, they gag, they can’t breathe.
 
Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop, they didn’t choke, they’re fantastic. They are fantastic people. Thank you. Look, they’re friends. We’re friends. Those two guys were incredible. Thank you very much, great job. Really great job. And a man that should be your Governor, I don’t know, he’s doing well, but Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, everybody. Thank you very much, great job. Handsome guy, handsome. Looks like Cary Grant. I hear you’re doing really well.

Look, I mean, this guy’s got this state totally closed down. It’s ridiculous. It’s, when are they going to open? When are they going to open? Dan, this would have been opened up a long time ago. And you would have done even better. I mean, you would have done better.

And North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley. Michael? Thank you, Michael.
 
Great job, Michael. How are we doing, Michael? How’s it going? Are we up? I mean, if I lose North Carolina, I’m getting out of here. This is not … Look at that. This is not, just so you know, the crowd of a man that’s coming in second.

I say it all the time. I said it when I left Michigan. 2016, the night of the election, we had 32,000 people. Hillary was there, just before me, in a prime location.

She had about 400 people. I got there at 12 in the evening, I started speaking at one in the morning, it’s now Election Day, and I left. 32,000 people, we had 32,000 people.

So it’s now Election Day. I start speaking, I started speaking, think of it, one o’clock in the morning, we had 30, you never saw anything like it. I left. I said, “That doesn’t look like we’re going to lose Michigan.”

And guess what? We didn’t. We won Michigan, first time in decades. And you know what we’ve done? Many, many car plants are now opening up.

A great gentleman, who’s just retiring, Prime Minister Abe, of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, please do me a favor. We need more car companies. You’re selling cars into our country, please. We want to build here, not in Japan, please.”

He said, “But we cannot do that. This is a free enterprise system.” I said, “I know, Shinzo, please. I need some car companies. Please do it.” “I can’t do it.” I said, “Shinzo, you have to do it.”

Next day, it was a story, “Five car companies to open up in Michigan,” right? So much for free enterprise, but he’s a great guy, he’s a friend of mine. He’s great. They’re lucky he’s a friend of mine. I would have been much tougher.

It’s hard. When a guy is a friend, it’s hard, but they did a lot. They did a lot. They helped it a lot. And what they’ve done here, by the way, Japan, and what they’ve done in Michigan, Ohio, what they’ve done?

By the way, we all love South Carolina, right, right? I think we love it. Now, South Carolina, we’re winning here, but South Carolina, I hate to say this to you, I don’t want to make you upset. We’re winning by about 400 points.

I spoke to a great person in South Carolina who said, “Sir, you don’t have to come here. This thing’s up by a lot.” What the hell is the difference, right?

I mean, we are up, and we’re up good, but I’d love you to tie South Carolina. What do we have to do? But a lot of activity in South Carolina also, they’re doing great.

You had the best year you’ve ever had. They’ve had the best year they ever had. And you’re going to go to a better year, we are going to have a better year.

We’re also deeply honored to be joined by a military spouse, Amy Williams, who was reunited with her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, at my State of the Union address. Everybody remembers that. Everybody remembers.

Look at that. Hi, Amy. What a great friendship. We had a great State of the Union, right? 

Good, you’re looking well. Thank you very much. Say hello to the whole family. Thank you.

Thanks to the incredible sacrifices of our warriors, and they are warriors. We’re pursuing peace in Afghanistan, it’s very close. We’re down to, we will soon be down to 4,000 soldiers. We’re taking them out.

They’re serving as policemen. They’re serving as police, and they’ve done a great job. We could win everything, but I’m not looking to kill three million people to win, what? To win what?

We should have never been in the Middle East, and we’re bringing them back. We’re bringing them back, just so you know, we’re bringing them back from Iraq. We’re down to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq.

And in Syria, we’re all back, we’re all finished, except for one thing. If it’s okay with you. I decided to keep the oil. We took the oil, we kept it.

And we’ll always support America’s incredible military families. So thank you very much. Thank you, darling. Really good. Okay.

In everything we do, we’re putting America first, unlike other administrations, and not just Obama and Biden. This has gone on for many years. We put America first, and that’s what we’re doing.

And you know what? Other countries, for the first time in decades, respect us again. Remember that. They respect us again. You know all about data, 28 countries. We had six countries that were current, and the amount of current is too low, okay? Six countries. I went in, and I said, “You got to pay. Sorry, you’re delinquent.”

They said, “Really?” “Yeah,” I said. “You’re delinquent. You got to pay.” Obama would go, and make a speech and leave, that would be it. We were paying for it.

We’re protecting Europe, and they’re screwing us on trade. So we protect them, and they’re screwing us on trade. No good, no good. Can’t do it. I said, “It’s unfair.”
 And the Secretary General, Stoltenberg, of NATO, said, “I’ve never seen,” and the fake news can call him up and check. He said, “He’s the greatest that we’ve ever seen.” For 20 years, the spending at NATO went like this, right? And America, we pick it up. Every time it goes down, they didn’t pay.

And I said, “We’re supposed to protect you. You’re going to be attacked by Russia or somebody, we’re supposed to protect you. And yet you’re delinquent. You don’t pay your bills.” And that includes Germany.
They’re paying 1%, they’re supposed to pay two, and 2% is way too low. 2% military spending.

So we got, listen to this. It never gets reported by these fakers. We got $130 million more, more, not total, more, going to, over three years, $400 billion.
So we’re going from 130 billion, with a B, not million, to $400 billion. And they said to me, they said …

And they said to me, they said to me, very nice guy, head of one of the countries, at a table. I can’t believe it never got released, but now we can talk about it, because it’s three years ago. But they said, “Sir … ” And this was a big private meeting of all of the nations, “Does that mean if we don’t … ” Because I said, “You got to pay your bills. We’re protecting you. You’re not paying your bills.” Some did, like Poland and some others, but most didn’t. Six to eight were current, and we were paying much more than we should have been paying, much more.

I mean, it’s Europe. We got to defend ourself, and there was no guarantee that they’d help us if we ever had a problem. Right? We’re never going to have a problem. We got so much stuff now. We were depleted. Now we have great … But they said to me, “Does this mean … ” And I had to give this answer. I can’t believe it didn’t get leaked by some sleazebag. We have leakers all over this place, but a lot of it didn’t leak. A lot of it is just made up by the newspapers. They make up phony stories.

They say, “Donald Trump woke up today. He was in a very bad mood, according to sources.” There is no source. They just made it up. Hey, I woke up, and I was in a bad mood. True. I’ve actually had a … I’ve been in a good mood, because we’re doing so much for our country. We’ve done so much for our country.

But at the NATO meeting, one of the presidents of one of the good countries, all good, they said, “Sir, does this mean that if we don’t pay, does this mean that you’re going to leave, and you’re not going to protect us?”

I said, “Yes. That’s what it means. I’m sorry.” It was an amazing effect, because other presidents said, “No. We will always protect you. We will always protect you, even if you don’t pay, even if our taxpayer is paying for everything, even though you take advantage of us on trade, you don’t let our cars in, you don’t let our stuff in, but you sell us like crazy, even though you tariff our product, even though you do everything, and then you take advantage of us with the military.” They said, “We will always protect you.”

So they didn’t pay. Why the hell would they pay? They said, “Boy, these guys are stupid.” So they asked me the question, “Does this mean, sir, that you will not protect us anymore if we don’t pay?” I said, “I’m sorry to say, it does.” That’s a big story. Three years ago, it’s a big story. It was amazing how the money came in. So we took in 130 billion a year, going over a three-year period, to 400, just because I asked. Right? Just because I asked. True.

They don’t report that story. Then we got lightweights that I fired, and they write books about me, that I’m a bad guy, “Oh, he’s a terrible guy. He treats our allies so badly.” No. Our allies treat us badly. Our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies. I must be honest with you. They take advantage of us. Everyone takes advantage of your country, and we don’t put up with it. And you know what the funny thing? We get along better now, because they respect us again. Before, they thought we were stupid. They respect us again. They do.

I mean, look at Israel, look what we did. I saw Kerry this other day. Is this guy the worst negotiator? Gave Iran 150 billion, plus 1.8 billion in cash. He never walked. Sometimes in a negotiation, when you’ve given everything, and you can’t give anymore, and then they want more, you get up ane walk. Remember the bicycle accident? That was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race. 73 years old. “I promise,” I said, “I will never ever … I promise to you, ride a bicycle in a race, or any other time frankly.”

I will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation. And he broke his leg, and his arm, and he was all screwed up. And that was actually a good thing, because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal, which I terminated. Nah, we had some terrible negotiators, and they all said, I saw them the other day, this was him like a year ago, “Mark my words, you will never ever sign deals with Arab countries, with Israel. It can’t be done.”

Well, we just signed the two great ones, and we got about seven more that want to come in. What a bunch, what a bunch. And then they say bad things about your president. They don’t like my foreign policy. I like my foreign policy. You like it. No, we were taken advantage of by the whole world. They’re so stupid, so stupid. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage that Biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period.

Joe Biden is weak. He’s supported every globalist sellout of North Carolina, the workers, what he’s done. And when I say, “him”, it’s him and people in his little group that … You’ve achieved so much over a period of time. He sold it out. Look at NAFTA. How bad was NAFTA? China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. TPP would have destroyed our car industry. And of course, he joined and wanted to join the Paris Climate Accord. That’s another beauty. That would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars. That was actually, I think, designed to put us out of business, literally.
Biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to China and other countries. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. You know that. You lost 43%, but I think the real number is 61%, by the way. Biden says that this an election between Scranton and Park Avenue. By the way, he left Scranton. He likes to say, “I was born in Pennsylvania.” But he doesn’t say he left. His father left. Not his fault, but they make it like he’s … No, he went to Delaware. He doesn’t leave Delaware, that I can tell you. Every time I see this guy … Wilmington, Delaware. Does he ever leave?

I’m in Los Angeles. I’m trying to work on the fires. They ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe. Ridiculous. The floors of the forest, it’s got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone, matchsticks. Forest management. Naturally, this is an election, not between Scranton or wherever it is. It’s really between Scranton and China, you know that, Scranton and China.

I’m with America. Biden is with China. If Biden wins, China wins. If we win, America wins, North Carolina wins, Pennsylvania wins, and the American workers win in every single state. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from this horrible, horrible deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when I ended the NAFTA nightmare. You got hit so hard. All those empty buildings all over the place, but a lot of them now are filled up because of us. They filled up. When did they fill up? Over the last three-and-a-half years. I proudly signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law, which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the United States, and it’s already doing.

We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared by more than $1 billion a year. Congratulations, good job. We launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces. This by itself would be a big achievement. This is one of so many different things, Right to Try, the military, the vets, everything. We’ve done so much, but we … 75 years, right? Last one was the Air Force. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, they’re so good. We have another one now, for 75 years, Space Force. We need it. I never even promised that. Right?

One of them said recently that, “He’s actually done more than he promised in the campaign.” That means I’m probably the only politician in history. They will tell you, these incredible women up here from North Carolina. Stand up. Will you, please? These are most incredible people. Thank you. Stand up. Turn around for the cameras, so they can see how incredible you are. Thank you.

Man, oh, man. What a life. But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice. You saw that. What Obama was nothing. It wasn’t working, the MISSION Act. That’s amazing. And accountability, where we can fire people in the VA that aren’t taking great care of our vets, okay? “You’re fired. Get out. You’re fired. Out.”
 
We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdad. We took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani. He’s dead. He’s dead.

I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I kept my promise, recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. I was signing a sheet of paper, you’ve heard this story, $1.1 billion. I said, “What’s this for?” They said, “Sir, now that you’ve moved, we’re going to build an embassy in Israel, in Jerusalem.” I say, “How much is it?” “1.1 billion.”

You got some friends of mine here, they’re builders. You don’t spend 1.1 billion on a one-story building. I don’t know what’s going on. So I said, “So, does it have to cost so much?” “Yes, sir. We’re buying land” So I called David Friedman. He’s our ambassador, he’s one of the most successful lawyers in New York. He’s a brilliant guy. He loves Israel. Right? Love Israel.

I call him. He’s the ambassador, he’s there. I said, “David, they want to spend 1.1 billion on a damn one-story embassy. It’s crazy.” I said, “Would you take a look? Maybe we own some land.” We own a lot of land. We’ve been there a long time.
 
Calls me back. He said, “Let me take a look at it, sir.” He calls me the next day. “Sir, we have a great piece of land, a much better location that we were going to way overpay for, a much bigger piece. We have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great.”

I said, “That’s fantastic, David. How much will it cost to renovate the building?” “I think we can do it for $190,000.” So I said, “David,” it’s the first time I’ve ever done it. I said, “David, it’s too cheap. You got to spend more than that.”

So a friend of mine, Ron Baron, he’s got an office building, and he’s got Jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building, Jerusalem stone. And every time I go in, he goes, “Oh, you got to see Jerusalem stone.” And he paid a fortune for it. He’s so proud of it. He doesn’t talk about anything but his Jerusalem stone.

I said, “David, do me a favor. You’re I Jerusalem. Right?” “Yes.” “Do they have Jerusalem stone?” “They got so much, we don’t know what to do with it.” I said, “Use all Jerusalem stone when you’re rebuilding the building, when you do your renovation. Everything, wrap it in Jerusalem stone.”

So I think we ended up spending, to fix up the building, like $500,000. Can you believe it? We were going to spend 1.1 billion, and by the way, it would never get built. It wouldn’t be built in 20 years from now. And they like it so much, they gave up the plan. They think this is better. It’s a better location, it’s probably a better building.

But I could tell you stories like that all night long, the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost, and then they use the electric catapults. You’ve heard that. Right? They don’t want to use steam. Why? Because it’s too simple, because it works, because it’s better. So they go to electric catapults that they’re working on for years now.

Elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic. Magnets. It sounds good. Trust me, it doesn’t work. One little glass of water. We’re in the ocean. One little glass of water, boom, those magnets are gone. I could have told them that. I actually asked the architect, ” Have you ever built a ship before?” It’s unbelievable.

You heard the story last night about Air Force One. It saved a lot of money. I said to Boeing, “No. It’s got to have a three in front of it.” They were going to buy Air Force One, 5.7 billion. It’s a lot of money, but look, it’s a helluva a deal. It’s a helluva a plane. What can I tell you.

I said, “How much is the new plane?” It was signed by Obama. “5.7 billion, sir.” I said, “That’s a lot of money.” It’s actually two planes. Air Force One is two planes. I’ll give you a little. They’re going to say, “That’s classified information.” Well, they’ve been flying around with two planes for 30 years, so I assume somebody knows. And our Air Force One is 31 years old. Right? So, look, it’s time. A lot of the Arab sheiks come in. I see their plane. They have a brand new one. I say, “What do we have?” 31 years, and we’re protecting them. Why the hell don’t we have a new one?

So they finally had, at 31 years old. The new one is totally different, 747. It’s much longer, bigger wingspan, much more beautiful. It’s modern, it’s beautiful. 5.7 billion. So I said to the head of Boeing, nice guy, Dennis, this was before they had their difficulty, which is terrible what happened to them, but I said to him, “Dennis, I’m not going to spend $5.7 billion on a plane. I’m not going to do it. I won’t do it. It’s too much.” I said last night, I told this story, first time, I said, “It’s got to have a three on it.” He said, “We can’t do it. No.”

He called me up the following day, “We’ll take 200 million off.” Somebody said, “Well, what are you losing?” I said, “Nothing. In fact, we’re gaining a generator.” And I said, “You got to build an extra generator.” He said, “We’ll take 200 million off.” I said, “Nope.”

I said to the general in charge, I said, “General, can we break the deal?” “Yes, sir, we can. We have a cancellation clause.” “Good. General, execute your cancellation clause. We’re not going to buy it. I’m not going to pay $5.7 billion for Air Force One. I’m not doing it.” He said, “Yes, sir. I’m very proud of this clause.” “Why? Why?” “Because we have the right to cancel.” “Well, do we have to pay anything?” “Yes, sir, $250 million.”

I said, “General, don’t cancel it. Take it back. Just tell them we don’t like the plane. Okay?” And I couldn’t even say, “I’m going to buy it from Europe.” The only competitor is Europe. I can’t say, “We’ll buy it from Europe.” No, that doesn’t work out to well. So I said, “Don’t do it. I don’t want to send them a check.” 250 million for nothing. Right? We don’t want to do it. So I said, “Just tell them, “We don’t like it. The price is too high. We’re not going to buy it.” But don’t send anything, don’t put it in writing. Please, general.” “Yes, sir.” “Thank you.”

So about a week later, the head of Boeing called me up. He said, “Look, we can get it down, but you’re asking for too much.” I said, “You don’t understand. It has to have a three on it, not a four, but three.” So another months goes by. I forgot about it. I get a call from Boeing, “Would 3.9 billion be okay?” I said, “Yes, that’s okay. It’s got a three on it.” True. True story.

True story, and then somebody said … it’s true though, somebody said, “Well, it must be a different plane.” Yeah. I said, “Yeah, we have a much nicer paint job.” We have a much nicer paint job, you know that, and it actually got an extra generator put on. Okay? So it’s actually more. They said, “well, we could use an extra generator.” I said, “Is there anything else you need?” They said, “Sir, we could use an extra generator.” I said, “We’ll get it for you, we’ll get it.” So I had it included in the price.

These people know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s called included in the price. But think of it, there’s hundreds of deals like that. But you’re one person, and that’s why I got Mark Meadows involved, because he’s from North Carolina. He’s from North Carolina, and he’s cheap as hell. I need some cheap people. Oh, there’s many, hundreds and hundreds of stories. I could tell you so much. It’s crazy.

The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country. It would destroy your Social Security and protections for preexisting conditions, it will. He’s going to drain your Medicare by giving away our healthcare to illegal immigrants. And I will tell you this, you’re going to have socialized medicine. That’s as sure as you’re there. And Obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. It was a lie. Said it 28 times, that we have, but it was a lie. But now you’re really losing your doctor. You’re going to have socialized medicine. Eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million Americans who love their healthcare. They have the best in the world.

His running mate sponsored the socialist takeover of healthcare. You saw that. He wants to ban private insurance. You’re going to lose … 180 million people are going to lose their healthcare under this Biden character, and he has no clue. They’re going to take it away from him. They’re going to be running him ragged. “Sign this. Sign this.” “Okay. What is it?” “Doesn’t matter. Just sign it, President, right now.” “I’m getting tired. I’d like to rest, I’d like to let Kamala take over as president.”

That’s no way to get into the office, because we’re going to have a woman president someday, but you know what? It can’t be Kamala. Kamala. Nobody treated him worse, and he picked her. I’ll tell you, I was … brilliant forecast. He could never pick her. She called him a racist. Right? She talked about Me Too-ing him. He was going to be Me Too-ed. Right? Me-Too-ed. A lot of bad things. There was nobody.

Think of it, even Pocahontas treated him better. She knocked the hell out of Bloomberg, but she left him sort of alone. I think she felt sorry for him. I heard she felt sorry for him. I don’t want people to feel sorry for our president. I want other people, really, to feel sorry for themselves, because we have somebody that knows what they’re doing. We can’t have it.

We can joke, we can play games, we can have fun. You can’t have this guy as your president. You can’t have him. Maybe I’ll sign an executive order. You cannot have him as your president. No, but you know this. Everybody knows this. And you know what? People are going to vote for him because they feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for him too. I feel sorry for him. And maybe he’ll show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate. Who the hell knows? I don’t know. But you know. You see the condition he’s in. You can’t have him as your president. And you know what? You can’t have her as your vice president, potentially going to be president. And that’s why they’re pushing so hard, because they know he’s going to be out very soon, and she’s going to take over. And she is the furthest left person of anybody. She is rated, not by me, she is rated further left than even Bernie Sanders. Okay? He’s second, she’s first.

And just in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world, and we will end our reliance on China and other countries once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of North Carolina. By the way, get out and vote, please. Okay? [ 01:56:26].

We will hire more police. Thank you, sheriffs. Thank you, sheriffs. I love the sheriffs. We got the endorsement from all the sheriffs in Florida, everybody up in Ohio and Texas. We have the stuff, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, the endorsements from law enforcement. We’re going to increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defeat everybody that we have to, including the virus, but we will defend the dignity of work, and we will defend the sanctity of life.

We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep … You know this, right? It’s okay, right? We will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars. We will maintain American’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. It’s about time.

We will end surprise medical bills, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we’re doing an unbelievable job on, other than the fact that the drug companies are spending a fortune, because they don’t like me much.

You will see drug prices, prescription drugs, dropping 50, 60, 70% in a very short period of time. Favored nations clauses. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.

America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You have to see what we’ve done with NASA. We’ll be the first one on Mars, I hope.
 We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriot education to our schools, patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, and we will never change it, by the way. We will never change it. They took the word, “God”, out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. I said, “Did they make a mistake.” Did they make a mistake. They didn’t for them. They made a mistake for us. We’re not going to put up with it. But we will keep, “In God we trust.”

For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. Remember it. We’re going to be a socialist country. We’re going to be a communist country. These people are further … they’re much further left than socialism. These people are sick.
So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Get out and vote. And watch to make sure they’re not cheating, which they will be. Early voting has already begun. Don’t wait. Get out and vote. We got to win this. If we win this state, we’re going to win the whole thing. This is a very important state.

If we win North Carolina, we’re going to win the whole thing, because we’re doing well everywhere, from Wilmington to Charlotte, from Concord to Raleigh, and from Greensboro to right here in Fayetteville. We inherit the legacy of generations of North Carolina patriots, who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation.
We stand on the shoulders of American heroes, who crossed the oceans, blazed a trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And you haven’t seen anything yet, haven’t seen [ 02:01:10].

Proud citizens like you, helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, with your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, General?
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will America strong again, we will make America proud again. We will America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Get out and vote, vote, vote, vote.",19/9/20
"Wow, that’s a big crowd. This is a big crowd.
Thank you very much, everybody. Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo. I’m thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots … days from now. Can you believe it, 43 days? We go to again win Ohio. I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob? That we’re going to win it by more than we did. Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points. I just came into that big, beautiful place. It’s got more televisions in any plane in history. They’ve got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings. I just saw that we’re tied in Ohio. I don’t think so … President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio? They’re not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it. Now, they’re fake polls. They’re almost as fake as the writers themselves. They’re all fake.

Remember last time they said, “No, he’s going to lose Ohio.” We won by nine points. So, we had seven swing states last time. President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasn’t president at that time, it was just Donald Trump. He will go home early. We did. That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states. They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times. They hired that guy. They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong. He was wrong. I don’t know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy. We had nine states. I was down at all of them on the day of election. I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what? I won every one of them. Fake polls. They’re fake polls.
 Then we have a crowd like this. I don’t know. Look, the cameras, are you turning around? These guys are bad people. I swear. They never turn the cameras around, ever. Turn them around. Turn them around. They never tell, look at them. It’s just like a bunch of stiffs. Real stiffs. Why don’t you turn the cameras around for once? You look back there, you can’t see it. There’s got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people. Oh boy, it’s always tough. You know, we go through this all the time. We’re always asking them, look at these crowds. I mean, as far, you can’t see it. You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business. Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don’t, they don’t get it. You only hear it from the sound.

I go home. I say to the first lady, “Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio?” She goes, “No, no. They just keep it on your face.” That includes Fox. They just keep it here, right here. They don’t want to show. You know what they don’t know and what they don’t get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them. It’s positive for their ratings. It’s really a good thing, but they don’t want to do it, but I give up on it. You know what you do? You hear it because you can’t have … You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he’s got the circles. You knowthose big circles? You know why he has the circles? He’s got four of them, because they can’t … I mean, think of it. He is a guy who’s failed every time he ran.
We called him 1% Joe and now he’s shot and he got their nomination. How the hell does that work out? How does that work out? But he’s got the circles. He got like four, sometimes he has six because that’s a good way of saying, if you don’t have any people, just put them in the circle and he’s practicing the science. Now it doesn’t work out, but we’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re doing things that nobody’s ever done before. We’re doing what nobody’s ever done, and thank you for being here.

I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth. As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice … Thank you everybody. Thank you. So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court. They say it’s the most important thing a president can do. I don’t know. I think military, maybe. We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars.
Great. We will fill that seat. It’s going to go quickly. Probably announced the person. I don’t want to make the men too angry. It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don’t want to have a problem with men. They’ll say Trump is doing very poorly with men. You listen. How’s he doing? Well, he’s doing very poorly with men, with women. He’s doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community. Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs. What’s he doing well? Oh no, it’s going to be a very short night. Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot. They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas. He did well with African American community.

By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community. We’re doing well with women. We’re doing very well. We’re doing well with suburbia, suburbia. I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia. If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia. We call it suburbia of the world and we love it. I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, you’re in deep trouble. So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me. You know why? They want security and they don’t want projects being right next to their house. That’s okay. They don’t want it. By the way, that includes minorities. Because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities. That includes them.
 They don’t want that. They want safe communities. They want great communities. They don’t want to lose the American dream. It’s very simple. I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia. Okay? Destroying it. I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know who’s in charge? You know who’s in charge of the program? Cory Booker, Cory Booker. Cory Booker. So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because you’re not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in. If I get in, you’ve got it. You’ve also got your second amendment if I get it.

In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority. Remember, they said, first of all, I wasn’t running. I wasn’t running. It makes a difference. Wait you see what happens. We’re going to take back the house. We’re going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi.
 Kevin McCarthy’s done a great job. We’re going to take back the house. People are so tired of her. People are so tired. Did you hear today? The latest. So, they impeached me for perfect phone call. Perfect. It was a perfect phone call. Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I’m constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead and I want them to do that. I want them to do that.
If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him. Well, I said, “Well, I’m the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme.” So, we’re going to put up our nominee who’s going to be outstanding. We’re looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way. I mean, honestly, it could be anyone. I mean, we’re going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday. Again, they say it’s the most important thing and think of it. So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think it’ll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices. Think of that. Three.

Some presidents, they never get any. They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none. We’ve had three. It’s blowing their minds. It’s blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want. So, it looks like we’re going to have three and it’s going to be very exciting. It’s exciting even from me. I’m going to look forward to it. Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and it’s somebody that you’re going to have great respect for, great respect. Thank you. Big stuff.
 That’s a big thing. They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether it’s on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country. Very important position, the most important. Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they’re too extreme to withstand any form of public review. If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition. They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box.
 
So, they don’t want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So, he’s going to have to put in radicals. So he doesn’t want to show who his judges are. I’ve shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesn’t want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, he’s going to be unelectable anyway. We’re going to find out.
 So, he wouldn’t be able to survive a Joe Biden. You wouldn’t be able to survive. We’ve been calling it socialism. I don’t think it’s socialism. I think it’s a step beyond what they’re talking about. You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland. These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime. There’s no law and order, no cash bail, no anything. You know what? The Republican cities are running great. They’re running great. So, we’re going to get it all changed around. We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldn’t believe. What did it take? You saw it. What did that take? I would say probably 30 minutes. Right? They should have called us in about seven days earlier.

How about the reporter? He gets up there, behind him is a burning city. I never saw anything like it. He’s saying, “There are really no protests here. This is very friendly.” We call this a friendly protester because you’re not supposed to have political rallies. You’re not supposed to have anything. The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what … That’s okay, because that’s protesting, but we’ll call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come-
… future the damage we’ll endure for generations to come. We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion. And a lot of that’s got to do with the fact that we’re going to have one extra, but we didn’t think this was going to happen. But I used to say just a week ago, “We’re going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor.” A lot of people said that’s the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time. 306, 306 to 223. “He will not get to 270.” Remember? “He will not get to 270. This will be a short evening for Donald Trump. Oh, good riddance. Thank God we got rid of him. Oh, this is going to be great.”

And then that problem happened. “Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio.” Remember the one, she was crying? She was crying. “Donald Trump has won Ohio.” But it wasn’t winning Ohio, it was by the margin. “Where the hell?” he said, “Where did this margin come from?” They opened the polls. Then they closed the polls. Normally you have to wait hours, unless it’s a total runaway. And they said, “Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won.” And they go, “Oh my God. But wait a minute. He won by nine points. What the hell’s going on over here?” Then they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina.” Remember that? Was that the most exciting evening, really? Remember?
And it’s not Donald Trump. It’s you. It’s all of us. They use the name Donald Trump. It’s all of us have won. And this one’s going to be even better because nobody has done, and then don’t even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what we’ve done. We’ve rebuilt our military. Two and a half trillion dollars. We’ve taken care of our vets. We have choice, we have accountability. We can fire people now when they’re not treating our vets right. We couldn’t do that before. They could treat our vets terribly. We have accountability. Nobody has done what we’ve done for our vets. 91% approval rating at the VA. 91%, the highest ever. So nobody’s done it, and that’s why I think this is going to be the most important of all. I used to say, “Well, I don’t know. How does it compare to 2016?” I just gave that up. This is the most important election.

You know why? Two reasons. Number one, that’s over with, the hell with it. The hell with it. But the truth is it’s got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts. And we’re finishing up with our military. We’re building Space Force. The wall is going incredibly. You remember the wall? They don’t talk about the wall anymore, the fake news. Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, “We’re going to build a wall, we’re going to build a wall,” the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it. I’m a real estate developer. You can always get money. You learn we have a lot of little pockets. We had a lot of big pockets.
 But the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers were great. So we’re up to 330 miles of wall. We’re doing 10 miles a week, and we’re going to be finished with the wall very soon. And it’s exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted. We’re building them the exact wall that they want. We can’t give them any excuses. We can’t give them any excuses. But it’s true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought I’d be able to get a bill. Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits. They sued us. Pelosi was suing us. Congress was suing us. The Senate was suing us. We won a lot of lawsuits. Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore.

And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built. You have no idea. You have no idea. You have no idea. But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, there’s more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, “We will build a wall,” I kept, “We will build a wall,” place would go crazy, I should have said, “We will not build the wall. Under no circumstances, will we build a wall,” the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted. It’s true. It’s true. And then they would have said, “See, he didn’t keep his campaign promise.” These people are sick. The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms. You know that. Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment. And they will do that.
 By the way, if I wasn’t here, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment right now. That would be gone. I hate to say it. I’m the only thing standing between you and chaos, I’m telling you. And Second Amendment and all of the other things. Biden’s justices will remove the words “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance. Did you see that? Did you see it? They said, “No, we’d never remove. And I saw it, they’re doing the Pledge of Allegiance. And I said, “Oh, it must be a typo.” They left the words “under God” out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats. And I said, “Oh, there’s a typo. Typo, they made a mistake. What a stupid mistake. Can you believe it? That guy’s in big trouble. What a stupid mistake.” And then I heard it a second time. They did the same mistake. That’s what they’re doing. They’re going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. That’s never happening. It’s never happening.

A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed. They don’t want our churches to open. You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets. 25,000 people don’t have to wear a mask, nothing. They can march down the streets, step on each other’s face, they can do whatever the hell they want, that’s okay. But you can’t go to church. They have ideas, they have plans, and it’s never happening with me as your President. That I can tell you. And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces. You see it. Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, “Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough?” “Sir, we have one, sir.” A General came in. “What’s the law, General?” “Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison.”
They didn’t use the word jail, prison. Prison’s a tougher word. I said, “What do you mean, 10 years?” “You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument.” I said, “General, let me see that sucker, please. Bring that to my office.” And we revived it because you can’t get that approved by Congress. They would never. Today in Congress, you’d do it, they’ll give you half a day in a hotel someplace. So 10 years. So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law. We updated it, and it was 10 years. You get 10 years in prison. You touch, you knock down a monument. And there’s no games. This is the old days. This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws. So here’s the thing. So they weren’t going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson. That’s not too good. They had obliterated a lot of different things.

And so I had a news conference. I announced that I’m signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail. And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service. We were all ready for them. We were ready for them. And the time came, there’s was only a problem, nobody showed up. You know why? 10 years was too much. 10 years was too much. It’s amazing the way. Isn’t it amazing the way it all works? So instead they burned down Portland. I speak to the Governor. The mayor is hopeless. He’s a hopeless, poor guy. They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks they’re wonderful people. They’re burning down his city. But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad. It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem. When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away. They left. That was the end of it. We had nothing to do.
 But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. Biden’s justices will erase national borders, they don’t want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals. And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you. Somebody said, “That’s not nice. That’s not politically correct.” I said, “That’s okay.” They’ll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children. That’s what they want. They don’t want any death penalty. Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody. You see the Boston Bomber, they’re still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives. He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives. And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote. You know that.

In three and a half years under my administration, we’ve secured America’s borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. I don’t know what it is. I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, I’m going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that they’re not even trying for Ohio. You know why? Because I love you and you love me, and that’s the way it is. That’s the way it is.
Thank you. I love you too. It’s very interesting. So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there’s crazy chances going on. They have too about the seat and all that. But there was another chant that’s happening at all these rallies. We’re having massive rallies. We’re in Minnesota. We had a tremendous crowd. Wisconsin, tremendous. Pennsylvania, every one of them. I mean, in all fairness, it’s like this, everyone. But this rant is going on like it’s crazy. And it’s, “We love you. We love you. We love you,” and you know what? I don’t want to say it. I’m just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, “We love you,” about, I guess I have to call myself a politician. I don’t feel like a politician. How nice is that? I never heard it. I’ve been to a lot of different speeches and rallies. I’ve never heard crowds go, “We love you.”

But you know why? We love you. I love you. But you know why? Because, again, nobody has done what we’ve done. Ohio had the best year in its history last year. We had a great year. And next year, assuming we win, which I hope we’re going to win, but if we win, you’re going to have a year next year. First of all, take a look at the third quarter. It’s going to be announced the numbers just before the election. They’ll come out three days before the election. And I’ll tell you what, I’ll bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people don’t want to give any stimulus, they don’t want to give anything. They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can. You know what they’re going to do? They’re going to announce they’re going to be opening on November 4th. There’ll be open. All these closed states, they’re going to be open on November 4th.

One of them blue and a teacher’s union. Did you see it? “No, we don’t want to open now. We don’t want to open. The pandemic. We don’t want to.” We’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. Vaccines are coming soon. “But we don’t want to open. Around November 4th we’re going to open.” This person that’s a judge of a union said that. That was not good. I think they’ll get rid of her quickly. I’m also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, what do I know? I said, “How’s it going? Everything good? Are you struggling?” They said, “Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you,” me, “that you closed football.” I said, “What do you mean I closed? I didn’t close.” The guy did an ad. It’s called disinformation. It’s called the opposite of what the fact is.
 Not only didn’t I close it, I didn’t think about it too much, okay? The states should all be open. But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, “Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea.” It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent. He has no idea. Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobody’s done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, “An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this,” I have 28 people now that have come forward saying it’s a total lie, they don’t care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, “Well, now the gloves are off.” Let’s face it, Joe Biden is incompetent. He always was even in prime time. he was incompetent in prime time. And now he’s really incompetent.

But because of the ad, I said, “It’s very interesting, that ad, it’s very interesting. Let me call up the Commissioner.” I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, “Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back?” “Well, I don’t know.” And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, he’s fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world. We get no credit for it. We’ve tested almost 100 million people. India is second with 38th and they have 1.5 billion people, slightly more than you. But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools. Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states. And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and it’s going to be very exciting. And I will tell you, it’s not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that.
 I mean, it was. I’ll tell you when I do it and when I don’t. But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed. And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it. I said, “I didn’t even know it was closed.” But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner. He was really good, I tell you. And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going. It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools. All of a sudden, everybody fell into line. I think they’re all open now. Every one of them is participating. So I want to thank the Commissioner. I want to thank all of those schools. May the best team win. In other words, Ohio State. That’s a good team. You know who the best proponents were? The players and especially the parents of the players.

These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are. And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldn’t play football. And they said, “We’re safer on the field than we are staying at home,” and they meant it. And we did something and I’m happy about it. So enjoy the football, enjoy it. Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only $2,945. So remember that. That’s 16 years, 2009, so let’s say 3000. Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost $7,000. So think of that, 16 years. Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country.
 
We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again. We’re building it again. I see the signs “Make America Great Again,” so I say this, it’s called now “Make America Great Again. Again”. Because we did it and then we had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. If we didn’t do that, you would have had three million people. It would have been terrible. It’s terrible anyway. They shouldn’t have allowed it to happen, China. To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two. Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate-

Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. That’s remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things. Where do you see what’s coming out? Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. That’s before today’s big breakout. You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, “Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe.” Well, we’re doing better than Europe. I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing. But they had a big hit and they’ll take care of it. They know how to do it. They’ll take care of it. We’re working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine. We have three vaccines right now that are right there. They’re right at the starting gate and they’re going to be fantastic. So it’s good.

With Biden, if you had that regime, you’d be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA. What we’ve done in a very safe manner is amazing. Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right? It’s called the H1N1. Remember he calls it the N1H1. I said, “No, no, no, no.” H comes before the N. It’s so easy. But he goes, “The N1H1.” We say, “No.” But it’s the swine flu. Maybe we just call it the swine flu. He did such a gross, horrible job on that. His own man who was in charge of it said they didn’t have a clue. They didn’t know what they were doing. It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people. Many, many people. It was totally incompetently.
And now I got this guy standing up. Well, we’re giving him advice. His own guy that ran it. Did everybody see this? They’re saying they didn’t have a clue what they were doing. It was so bad. I don’t know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you. Who would say that? Maybe because he was honest. Does that make sense? Now Biden gets up and he’s saying to do the same things as we’ve already done. He basically took our plan and he said, “This is what you should do.” But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far.

Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.9 million jobs in the state of Ohio. You know that? He knows it. He’s got one of them. He’s got one of them. Through operation warp speed, we’re developing these great vaccines. And that’s going to be… Literally, these will be done in record time. Like nobody’s ever done it before. On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country. He actually suggested that he would shut down the country. We now know the disease. We didn’t know it. Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that’s what it really affects. That’s it.

You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody. They have a strong immune system. Who knows? Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody. It’s an amazing thing. By the way, open your schools. Everybody open your schools. Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens. How about that one? You know the bad part about that? We all have heart. We want to take care of people. Probably that is everybody’s going to come to the United States. People that weren’t even thinking about it, they’re going to say, “Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education. They’re giving free everything. They’re giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border.”
 Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, “He misrepresented. They are not getting a Rolls Royce.” I agree. Now they’re sick. They are sick. And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. They’re doing that. We’re stopping it. To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we’re launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time. We got to. No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America.

Biden’s running mate, Kamilla. Who likes Kamilla? Does anybody like her? She was the most failed candidate. I mean, she started off good. And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points. Didn’t she leave at about two or one? She was heading down to the basement. She was so mean to him. I felt sorry for him. No, I did. I felt sorry. So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer. He was MeToo. He was a part of the MeToo generation. What she called him, what she said. So I brilliantly said, “Well, he can’t pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty. How nasty was she to Bloomberg? Was she unbelievable?

Boy, he was standing there. What happened? What happened? No, actually. What happened? Mini Mike. He’s another beauty. He’s a real beauty. Mini Mike, what happened? What the hell happened? He hit her so hard. Remember? She hits him with about 30 different things, and I’m not talking about our president. He thought she was talking about me. Can you believe it? And I’m not talking. I’m talking about you. He said, “Get me out of here. Get me out of here.” And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party. He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats. He hasn’t taken enough abuse. If I were him, I’d sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer.

Biden’s running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail. You saw that? Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child. Now they’re trying to free them on bail. They’re putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist. And that’s what it is. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and that’s what we’re doing for many people in jail. Many people.

Remember what I told you about the monuments? This is remembrance. Isn’t it beautiful? We don’t see that anymore. Have you seen a monument knocked down recently? No, we don’t see it anymore. I don’t know. We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln. It got to Lincoln. First, it was not too many people heard of him. Confederate soldiers, et cetera. You say, “Hey, look, do it through a process.” But they started hitting Lincoln. Then they hit Gandhi. Now Gandhi was about peace. Gandhi just wanted peace. Leave me alone. Peace, peace, peace. Let’s rip them down. They’re sick people. The Democrat party’s war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives. If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide.

I’ll tell you, the community that’s most hurt, most hurt by what they’re doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community. And we’re doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community. And the Asian community. We’re doing great. In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo. They did. It must be an error. It wasn’t. It’s no error. You’re going to find out on November 3rd it’s no error.

As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. They’re great people. They’re very brave people. Not easy, and they don’t get support. We have to give them back their dignity. We have to let them do their job. That’s very simple. They’re great. We’re joined tonight by two high school football players. They became very, very famous. They became more famous than President Trump. They were beautiful. I watched them running through the crowds with those flags. Here’s some place, I don’t know, you got a lot of people here. We’re going to try and figure it out. Hold up your flag. Jared Bentley and Brady Williams, who were recently suspended from their high school football team after displaying flags in support of our police and first responders on the anniversary of September 11th attacks. Where are they?

Come up here, fellas. Come up. Come up here. Come up here. Secret Service is thrilled about this. See, these young kids can hop over the fence like it’s nothing. Come up here. They’re good looking kids. I want to congratulate you. You become famous. They’re going to go to Hollywood. They’re going to become movie actors right now. Right? You feel good about it?
He said it could be better. You know what? You’re doing great. And everybody out here loves you and they appreciate you. You did a great job. Good job, fella. Good job. Good luck. Is your arm okay? Good. You all right? Good. Good guys. Good guys. Jared and Brady, thank you for supporting the heroes in our law enforcement. We all love you. I’m telling you. You really set something up that’s incredible, and thank your parents for letting you do it. I watched. You ask your parents approval. Isn’t that nice? You know what the father said? “You better do it.” Right? That’s great. Thank you very much, fellas. Great job. Really great job. Country has a lot of respect.

Speaking about warriors, we’re also joined tonight by some great, great congressmen who are warriors and they represent Ohio so well and they love you and they love our country. Representative Bob Latta. Thank you, Bob. Great job. They like you, Bob. That’s very good. Good job, Bob. Thank you very much. Congressman Warren Davidson. You know Warren. Thank you, Warren. Great job, Warren. Congressman Mike Turner. A great lawyer, actually. Thank you, Mike. Great job, Mike. You’re really great. Ohio treasurer Robert Sprague. Robert, thank you. Thanks. Good treasurer. Ohio auditor Keith Faber. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Keith. Ohio House speaker, Bob Cupp. Where is he? Thank you, Bob. Great job. Ohio Senate president, Larry Obhof. Thank you. Thank you, Larry Obhof. Larry is a good man. How’s it going, Larry? Good. You’re doing a good job.
You’re right about that. You’re doing a great job. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate it. Ohio GOP chairman Jane Timken. She’s unbelievable. Thank you, Jane. How are we doing, Jane? How’s it going? How does it compare to four years ago, Jane?
Up higher. All right. Good. Good. I think we are. I think we are. A friend of mine that I’ll tell you, this is the greatest optimist. When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support. The head of the Republican party, little things like that. I said, “We don’t have a head of the Republican party. He left because you had a terrible governor in this state.” Terrible. Your previous governor was terrible. He was terrible. I’ll tell you, I got this man. I didn’t know him. Within about a week, I said, “Man, this guy’s a big optimist.” And he was right. He called it right to the thing. He ran my campaign. When he came back for the second time, we had him in a high position. I said, “Bob, I think you’re great. You’re doing a great job. I want you back in Ohio. We have to do it again.” Bob Paduchik. Where’s Bob? Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. He wants no glamor. He wants no glory. He just wants to win.

He called it right down to the bone. We had a rough couple of days. I said, “Bob, how we doing?” “You went up two points.” I said, “You got to be kidding.” But we did. So much evolves around Ohio and it’s just a state that we have a relationship with. It’s a great state. We’ve done a great job for you and you’ve done a great job for us. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you.

Together, we’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period. Think of it. He’s always talking about, “You should have done this. You should have done that.” He really just left office. It’s not that long ago, right? He’s been there for years and years and now he should have done. He’s never going to do anything. He’s never going to do anything. Guy is a stone cold loser. Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord? That’s another beauty. I’ll tell you, that was designed to hurt our country.

You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place. In the meantime, China didn’t kick in for another 10 years. The whole thing was a rigged deal. I tell you, I said, “I’m going to get killed for this one, but we’re going to terminate.” And you know what? The people got it right away. Everybody understood. That was another rip off of our country. This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends… He doesn’t have a clue. What the hell? We’re talking like he knows. He’s got guys around him that are pretty smart. They’re radical left. He’s going to do whatever they tell him to do. He pretends to care about blue collar workers. After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, “Why didn’t you do this? Why didn’t you do that?” You see these fake commercials. “Why didn’t you do it?” I said, “I’ve only been here three and a half years. This guy has been here for 47 years. He didn’t do anything.”

History says when you’re here for 47 years and you fail, it’s not going to happen. But he was closing your factories, opening your borders, outsourcing your jobs and inflicting economic carnage on your towns and you know that. And I came along and you had the greatest couple of years you’ve ever had. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the transpacific partnership with [ 00:17:38]. My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right? The home of the Jeep. That’s good. That’s a great brand. They’ve done a great job with Jeep. Jeep. Everyone loves Jeep.

Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare. I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July. That’s a big difference. Like day and night. It’s working out great too. It’s working out great. You know how I know that it’s a good deal for us? Because they don’t like it. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Ohio jobs. We achieved American energy. We passed record tax cuts and regulations. Our energy independence is incredible. We have now energy independence. We don’t have to be in these far away lands anymore. Now we’ll be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we don’t have to be.

Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63%. They want to close it up. By the way, you do know they want to close it up. They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever. They want to close it up. This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs. Probably more than a million. While I’m president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way.

I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people. We have tremendous support all over the country. I’ll tell you what. These people are great. And here’s the platform that they have. Sleepy Joe Biden. No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns. Now I’m in Texas. It’s a really rough thing in Ohio, but now we’re talking Texas. No oil, that doesn’t work well in Texas, right? No guns. That doesn’t work well in Texas. No God. Look what they’re doing to the churches and everything. That doesn’t work. No God. No religion. That doesn’t work well. You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln. Okay. Your VP candidate. And you’d still lose very big. And then they say-

… and you’d still lose very big. And then they say, “Yeah, he’s doing okay. He’s two up in Texas.” They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago. And everybody said, “No, I think Trump is killing it.” We’d have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldn’t get in. We’d have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and they’d say I was even. We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide. You know the expression they use, “Texas is in play.” You know what “in play” means? It could go either way. And guys would get on there and say, “I don’t think so.” And then that night again, “The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.” I mean, the whole thing is crazy. It’s crazy, it’s crazy.

You know what they do? It’s suppression polls. They try and depress you. They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, “Darling, let’s have dinner. It’s so sad. We love Donald, but he just can’t make it. He can’t make it. Let’s go out, have dinner. We’ll come home and watch the results.” Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass. Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings? I think the biggest ever. But was that the most exciting? 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television?

We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, including more than $6 billion in contracts. I’ll tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima. And I tell you what, I saved Lima. I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima. They were going to close the tank plant. It was done. And I said, “Why are we closing a tank plant?” And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here. And I got calls. And Jim Jordan called me. Do you like Jim Jordan? He’s great. And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima. I said, “Why are we closing it?” And I saw the people building the tanks and the technology’s incredible. And if you ever closed it, you’d never be able to open a thing like that again. So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we’re making a record number of tanks in that plant and it’s absolutely thriving.

But we had tremendous success. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead. He’s dead. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They paid $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash. You know they got? Nothing. They got nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it. They never did it. They never did it. They didn’t have the guts to do it. They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it. Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them. A lot of pressure put on me. Every leader was calling all over. “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it. Mr. President, please don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t move it. Just leave it the way it is. It’s okay.”

But I promised and I said, “I’m going to do it.” And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world. Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, “Please, please don’t tell it.” Then I got calls, “Please have him call me back me,” me. I said, “Look, tell everybody I’m out for three days. I’m not going to be able to call them back.” I had a news conference, we announced it. Then I called everybody back. “Hey, how you doing? How’s everything going? Everything going good?” “Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it’s too late. You already did it.” And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done. And it’s something we had to do. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East. And you saw that.

And I’m the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn’t get any press. They wouldn’t. For two of them. Last week, I’m not bragging about it, I’m just saying, I’m the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they’ve been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. We’ll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. We’re going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I told this story last night. Should I tell it or not? Should I? Yes. She wants me to do it. So I go home to our great First Lady. I said, “First Lady, you’re going to be so proud of me tonight. I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people.” Great people.

“First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.” I was like this. “I was nominated.” It’s a big deal for our country, right? And she said, “Oh, that’s good.” I said, “Let’s turn on the evening news. Let’s watch it. This is going to be a big show tonight. Get ready.” And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and I’m talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC. MSDNC is the worst. So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty. And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else. And I’m saying, “First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. We’re 20 minutes into a half hour show. They haven’t mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize.” And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned. Then I got nominated for a second one. They never mentioned. And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn’t know why he was nominated.

It was like right at the very beginning. He didn’t do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I’ve ever seen. But that’s okay. In the meantime, we’re President and they’re not. No, that’s right. You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, you’d get maybe half a second. The First Lady, she said, “Sorry, darling. That’s the way it goes, isn’t it?” Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War disaster. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country. “Oh, it’s really great.” If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world.

And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining. We had an insurmountable lead on China. I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years. We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were. The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy. He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions. That’s what he’s going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700%. And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie. He made this deal with Crazy Bernie. And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years.

Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Very important to have them. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. They’re totally against it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just, in conclusion, first of all, it’s been a great honor to be with you. This is, really, it’s a great state. They’re great people. I really mean it. No, I really mean it. Get out there on November 3rd. We’ve got to win this one big. This is a bad, bad ideology. This is probably a step beyond socialism. I really think in many ways, it’s communism we’re talking about. This is a step beyond. Socialism’s no good. Communism’s really bad. But get out there on November 3rd and let’s show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us.

So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police. And by the way, thank you, police. Thank you, law enforcement. Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars.

We will maintain America’s unrivaled military. Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we’ve done. And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what we’ve done over the last three years, it’s almost better for you not to see it. We are the envy of every power, every country in the world. We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible. And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them. And the way we don’t have to use them is to keep that kind of strength. Nobody’s going to be talking to us. We’re going to have peace through strength, and it’s all made in the U.S.A. Made in the U.S.A. We’ll end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I’ve already signed it into law. Kicks in on January 1st. It’s going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn’t believe. That doesn’t mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me. But that’s okay.

And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, 60% and 70%. Big pharma does not like me too much. They’re taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it. They’re not too thrilled with me, including the rebates. The rebates go back to you. The rebates before went back to very rich people. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s what’s happening. NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world. There’s nothing like a space center, what we’ve done. And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago.

We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and don’t wait. And when you see them cheating on the other side, I don’t say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, you’ll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities. The authorities awaiting and watching. From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S. Grant, that’s good. Nobody’s stock has gone up like Grant. Nobody in the last 10 years. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people.

With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Get out and vote. Thank you.",21/9/20
"Well thank you very much, Ohio. Thank you very much. Thank you. You know, this is really not a rally, you know this, this has to do with workers, programs, all the things we love, but this is really, we call it a friendly protest. And you know what we’re protesting? We’re protesting stupidity. Because there’s so many stupid things you see here. But hello, I’ll tell you what Ohio, how good have you been? How good have you been? What did we win by? A lot. And your governor’s here, and he just said you’re winning by a lot more this time than last time. So that’s good. Thank you. Mike, thank you very much. But hello, Ohio. And thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be here in Dayton, the home of the Wright Brothers, wow. I wonder what they would think when they see some of these F-35s and these crazy planes that we make nowadays that go thousands of miles an hour, right? I wonder.

But I want to just thank the very hard working patriots who are the backbone of America. You really are. You’re the backbone of America. This is an amazing group of people. This is an amazing group. You know, I’m going to another very nice spot in Ohio where we do have a rally, but I can’t imagine you have many more people than we have here, but they will, about 10 times more. No, this is for us and our friends and workers. We want workers. 43 days from now, We are going to win this state. We are going to win four more years in the White House. That’s true.
Thank you. Thank you. You had your best year in the history of your state and the history of our country last year. And we had it until the plague came in, and now we’re building it up again rapidly, but you had the best year, and we’re going to have… next year will be the best year we’ve ever had. I believe that. You’ll see that in the third quarter. But we’re here today to talk about jobs. We’re talking about jobs, a very favorite subject of mine to know and to understand that the choice in November is going to be very simple. There’s never been a time where there’s such a difference. One is probably communism. I don’t know. They keep saying socialism. I think they’re gone. They’ve got over that one, that one’s passed already. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping your jobs to China, and foreign countries. You know that.
And I’ve spent the last four years bringing the jobs back to our country, and back to Ohio. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we lift our nation to soaring new heights of prosperity, or whether we will allow a Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, to shut down our economy, impose a four trillion, that’s with a T, by the way, $4 trillion tax hike, abolish Ohio clean coal, oil, natural gas, and ship your jobs and factories and dreams overseas to China and countries that you’ve never even heard of. Put simply, if Biden wins, China wins. If we win, Ohio wins, and most importantly, in all fairness, America wins. Because you finally have a president who puts America first. And I do put America first. I guess that’s why almost four years ago, that’s why I did this, right? It’s because of this, probably more than any other reason. I watched the jobs going out. I never saw anything so stupid in my life. I watched the worst trade deals, and we’ve reversed many of them, almost all of them now, but we’ve reversed them.

And again, we were having the greatest year we’ve ever had, and it’s going to be back very soon. You take a look at what’s happening. We’re joined today by a real good friend of mine. Somebody that’s been with me from the beginning. And I’ve been with him from the beginning, Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine. Where’s Mike? Where’s Mike? He’s opening up. Where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. He’s a good man. And Lieutenant governor John Euston. Good guys. Yeah. Thanks John. Good job. Congressman Warren Davidson, do you know Warren? Wow. Warren, that’s very impressive. These are real warriors. I’ll tell you another one, Mike Turner. Do we know Mike? Hell of a lawyer. Thank you, Mike. Thanks for all the help too, both of you, really appreciate it. And a man, I don’t know if you know him. He should become legendary, because when we didn’t have a lot of support, I had a guy named Bob Paduchik, do you know Bob? He kept saying, every time I said, “You know, we’re not getting the kind of support from the top people.” He said, “That’s okay, sir, you went up another two points.”

We won this state by a lot. Remember the fake news. It’s a lot of it back there too, a lot of fake news. But they were going around Mike, hey Mike, they were going around saying, “Well, Trump may not be able to, in order to when you have to win Ohio, right? And then for a year, I heard, “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” But they didn’t say the great state, I say the great state. And I heard it. I heard it for so long. It would be impossible. And then we won that night by what? Nine points? What was it Bob? Nine points. We won by a lot. In fact, it was the first indication that that was going to be a tough night for the Democrats. They said, “Ladies and gentlemen, not only did Trump win Ohio, he won by a hell of a lot more than we anticipated.” And then we won, look at these guys. That’s why I love these guys. Look at this. Nobody’s messing with these guys. You know, they’re great workers, but we use them also for security. If everyone gets a little bit rough, you’ll take care, right fellas? Thank you very much. Thank you. But we won it big, and that was the beginning of one of the most exciting nights in history, because we did something in 2016 that was amazing. And I’ll tell you, honestly, there is more enthusiasm now, and this is fact. In fact, they have a new thing. First of all, you know, we’re working very hard on getting a third Supreme Court Justice. I’m going to announce who that is. The only thing I’ll say, for the women, it will be a woman. Uh oh. There are a lot of angry people. Okay. Here’s the question. Okay. It will be a woman. Does anybody here, please raise your hand if you have the courage, is there anybody here that insists that it will be and should be a man? Is there anybody with the courage, please put up your hand right now. A lot of women here.

So, okay. Ready? Supreme Court Justice, most powerful, most important, just the most important, you know, when you become president, they say, “This is the single most important thing a president does, is pick Supreme Court… ” And by the way, by the end of the first term, we will have 300 federal judges, a record. So let’s give me a free poll. We do this, I have such fun with it. We do it. Give me a free poll. If they go out, they charge hundreds of thousands of dollars. They interview like 19 people, which mean nothing. Here we got a lot of people. So give me a free poll, who would like to see a woman Justice of the Supreme Court. Who would like to see a male Justice of the Supreme Court. The only one I hear there is women. Some women. What’s that all about? No, it will be a brilliant person. It will be, I have five that we’re vetting right now. It’ll be a brilliant person. It will be a woman. It will be a woman. And we’re looking forward to it.

And it will probably announce it on Saturday, maybe Friday, but Saturday. And it’s a big day for our country. It’s a big day for you. It’s a big day for Ohio. And so I think it will be great. I always love, why’d you say that? Like big day for Ohio, and I do it somewhat routinely. Do you ever notice when Biden goes out, and he always picks the wrong location. Like if he’s in Ohio, it’s great to be in the state of Florida. And he looks around, and he doesn’t see too many palm trees. He says, “Are we in Florida?” “No, you’re not.” He did that seven times. How do you do that? When you do that, you just walk off the stage. It’s over. There’s nothing you can do. You can make the greatest remainder of the speech, there’s nothing you can do to save it. But the people of Dayton know better than anyone, the terrible damage that Biden has inflicted over his nearly 50 years, 47 years to be exact. Can you believe it? For 47 years, Joe Biden shook the hands of American workers, and then stabbed them in the back.

He said, “Washington vultures.” I mean, think of it, all over, and they raked in cash. They raked in big money. Where’s his son? Where is he? Where’s his son? I’ll tell you. Where is he? What did I say, “Where is,” Where is he? Go ahead. You know, we did that for fun. Where’s Hunter? We did a t-shirt. That thing sold, we come up with these little gems. Where’s Hunter? You know where he is? Yeah. He’s in the basement with his father. Where’s Hunter? No, Hunter did very well. He had no job, he was thrown out of the military, he was thrown out. He had no job. And then he goes to Ukraine, and he gets $183,000 a month. Although he had no experience whatsoever, knew nothing about the subject of the company, which you know, was energy. I think they got an upfront payment of three million…

… energy. I think they got an upfront payment of three million just to be able to get them. Think of that, $183,000 a month and three million dollar upfront payment. How about that? I’d take that one myself. Then they go to China, he walks out with one point five billion to manage, which is millions of dollars a year. The whole thing is crazy and the fake news doesn’t want to cover it. They don’t want to cover it. Did you see the interview the other day with Anderson Cooper, the other night? That was softball, that was like, “Here, Joe.” So we’ll see. We have a debate coming up and who knows, look he’s been doing this … You know what, he’s been doing it for 47 years. I’ve been doing it for three and a half years, so he should be able to beat me I would think, he’s much more experienced. He’s great, oh, he’s a beauty. But he betrayed you, he lied to you, he abused you, which is why it’s time to retire Joe Biden, this is serious stuff. Do we have any Teamsters here? Teamsters, any Teamsters here? That’s all? One. All right, well, I did a big favor for the Teamsters, they had trucking company. I think 30,000 jobs going out. James Hoffa called up, “Could you help? Could you help? Could you help?” I helped, I kept that company going. They saved 30,000 jobs, but then every year they always endorse the Democrat, doesn’t matter, good or bad. And James Hoffa, I’m so disappointed in that guy. So I called, I said, “I’d love to get their support.” “Oh, I’m sorry, sir. They’ve already endorsed sleepy Joe Biden.” It’s like automatic, but you know who doesn’t endorse him, all the workers underneath and they’ll either throw him out or he’ll retire. He’ll retire. You get tired of it, it’s like automatic. They endorse the Democrat because the Democrats do whatever the hell they want. But the workers, the people underneath, the real people, they’re with us all the way.

I’ve hired thousands and thousands of Teamsters, all the concrete work on buildings in Manhattan. But they just like wedded. It’s almost like a habit. I consider it a habit and I think it’s disgraceful. But I saved this company, a big company, good company, great people. We saved it. And then you say unrelated, totally unrelated, “Hey, we’d love to have you.” “Well, I’m sorry, it’s already done.” These people are terrible, but that’s all right. You always have to remember things. Remember, you got to remember, right workers? On November 3rd, we must turn the page forever on the failed corrupt political class. That’s what it is. They get so much things that are so unfair to the rest of our country and that’s why they’re always with that top level of Democrat but the workers are with us.

Biden is a diehard globalist. Globalists are out, you know that right? Globalist destroyed, they helped destroy this country. I’ll tell you if I didn’t come along, I really mean it. This country was, it was going down and we stopped it. If you look at your Second Amendment, if you look at so many different things, no matter what it is. You look at our jobs, our jobs prior to the plague and now coming back. The housing is record setting. Car manufacturing is record setting. You take a look at car sales are record setting. Retailing, who would think retail is record setting. It’s amazing because we had such a good foundation. We closed it up, we saved millions of lives. We had no choice, we had to do that. And then we opened it and now we’re rocking and it’s going good. It’s really going good.

But the Democrats really waged war on the American workers for half a century. Look what they’ve done. Biden’s policies destroyed 60,000 factories and killed four point, think of it, four point five million manufacturing jobs. We brought back 700,000 when they said, right, they said the magic wand, you can’t do it, manufacturing jobs are gone. I said, “Really? I don’t think so.” Biden championed the NAFTA disaster and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which was a total catastrophe. That’s when China started going up like a rocket. They’re considered in the world trade, they’re considered a developing nation. No, they’re not a developing nation. By being a developing nation they get all sorts of advantages over us. So we’ve been protesting it and we do things that you wouldn’t believe. You don’t even want to hear about it because it’s disgraceful. China is a developing nation. And therefore for years and years, they had big advantages over the United States but no more.

What followed was the nothing short, and think of it, nothing short of a blue collar carnage and it was in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan. You know how many car plants we’re bringing back to Michigan. Nobody’s ever seen it. For 40 years, they didn’t build a plant. And now they’re building them all over. And I tell countries, I told a great gentleman, he just retired, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, you got to build plants here, you can’t do this. You’re building your cars in Japan and sending them. We want our cars built here. We want cars built here.” He said, “Well, that’s not up to me, that’s up to the company.” “That’s all right, Shinzo, I know you can do it.” The next day they announced five plants, I mean, what can I tell you?

I know my people, it’s up to Shinzo, it wasn’t up to anybody else, but he’s great. The workers of America will never forget Biden’s economic treachery. They will remember in November after Biden betrayed and think of it, all the betrayals on NAFTA and China, 40% of all of the manufacturing jobs were shipped out of Dayton. And now the good thing is your roads, you didn’t have a lot of traffic. So that’s the good news, everything else was bad, right? It was everything else was bad. 30,000 Dayton families saw their jobs disappear overnight. By 2016, the per capita income in Dayton had fallen 12% below the national average of $50,000. Remember this, this all happened … I mean, these numbers are incredible what’s happened in three years. Ohio lost one in three manufacturing jobs, two out of three iron and steel mill jobs. And half of its auto jobs, courtesy of Joe Biden and that crew, that group, that whole ideology.

And now of course his ideology has changed. He’s so far left that he is … just so you understand, he has no choice. It’s not him. He’s being pulled left. You see where Kamala, Kamala, she another great one that one. You see her poll numbers, her poll numbers were going down and I can’t … nobody treated him worse than Kamala, right? And she said the Harris administration and working with Joe Biden, did you see that? But he said worse, he said the Harris, right, he said the Harris, Biden administration. And I heard that, I actually heard that live, although it’s not real live, I’ll tell you. It’s sort of half gone, it’s shot, it’s shot. But he said the Harris, Biden administration will … and that’s where it is. Look, this guy is shot. I mean, if he makes it, it’s going to be … I’m going to come back to Dayton and I’m going to say what the hell happened?

I will have lost to the worst presidential candidate in the history of politics. I really believe that. The guy can’t speak without the teleprompter, although I’m telling you, I’m telling you, I think … she says [ 00:27:10]. I hope you’re right. I hope you’re … Thank you. I hope you’re right. I tell you the country can’t afford it. One thing I’ve learned is that President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un, North Korea, every one of these leaders, they’re not shot. And we can’t have somebody that’s sleepy. We can’t have a sleepy guy negotiating. Oh, would they like to see him though? Did you see, would they like to see Joe? It’s their dream to see Joe. How about Iran, you think around might like to see Joe Biden? They’d go back, they say give me another $150 billion. We gave them 150 billion. We gave them one point eight billion in cash. You know what that looks like, one point eight billion in cash?

And I’ll tell you what, if and when we win, we will get a call within about nine seconds after the victory and it’ll be Iran, it’s going to want to make a deal. We want them to make a deal. We want them to be good. We want them to be strong. They just can’t have a nuclear weapon. That’s all, it’s very simple. You can’t have a nuclear weapon. But I told people, I said, “Don’t talk to them now, look, they want to wait.” This is the gift. If they could do that, if China could do it, I mean, think of it. If Russia could do it, by the way, nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me with the sanctions. With the … I exposed, right, Nord Stream 2, that’s the pipeline. No, you never heard of Nord Stream until I came along.

I said to Germany, let me get this straight. We defend Germany, right? We defend Germany and that’s it. They don’t pay what they’re supposed to pay, they’re delinquent, they’re delinquent. So I said to Angela and I like Angela, but I said, but she’s smart, why should she pay if she doesn’t have to. So I said, “Angela, so we defend you against Russia and you pay billions of dollars to Russia. How does that work? Explain to me what’s that all about?” But you never heard about that stuff. We’d give tank busters to Ukraine. We sell them in theory, I don’t know if we’ll ever get the money. We sell them. But he gave pillows, maybe he got them from Mike Lindell, the pillow man. You think when Obama sent pillows over to Ukraine, I send tank busters, they sent pillows. And the fake news goes, oh. Let me tell you, we have been very rough but at the same time we get along. I like Putin, he likes me. We get along. Wouldn’t you say it’s smart to get along, okay, it’s smart.

I get along or I got along with President Xi, but I don’t know, after what happened here I’m having a hard time with China, I really am. They’re buying a lot, the trade deal has been incredible. They have been living up to it in all fairness. The largest order of corn in the history of our country, largest order of soybeans, largest cattle order. But it means less now, you understand. If we wouldn’t have been hit with this pandemic, which they could’ve stopped, it would have meant a lot. But it just means a lot less to me right now. So now after selling you out and bleeding you dry, Biden is back asking for your vote. The guy, when he was in prime time, which for him was about halftime. Long time ago, I had a friend, a senator, a Democrat, believe it or not. I used to get along with Democrats very well, actually better than the Republicans, but I won’t say that.

But I asked him, “Who’s your smartest senator?” And he gave me a name. This is 25 years ago. I said, “Who’s your dumbest Senator?” “Joe.” “Who’s Joe?” “Joe Biden.” Oh, I see, he is, really?” “Yeah, he’s the dumbest senator.” Well, now he’s a lot dumber than it used to be, I can tell you. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. And you can take the gloves up because they do all this disinformation, they make up phony stuff. Like the military with what he said, I think it’s a disgrace and he should apologize. A source said. I have 27 people that said, no way, it didn’t happen. They said … and the names are out there. So when they do that, you take the gloves off, that’s all. Really dishonest people, dishonest people. No, it’s a disgrace.

And nobody’s done for the military what I’ve done. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. We’ve made it stronger than ever. We have the greatest weapons in the world. We’ve gotten raises for our great warriors. Our vet just got a 91% approval rating, the highest in the history of the V.A., our vets. They gave it a 91, the V.A., gave it a 91% approval rating. Nobody’s done more, nobody. And we do. We have weapons, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. Hope to God we don’t have to use them but nobody has them. Not China, not Russia, nobody has the weaponry that we have. We have the greatest weapons in the world and hopefully don’t have to use them. Just remember that, we have the … I call it the super-duper missiles, like at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. You don’t see them either. They go through here, they say, “Boy, what happened? What was that? It’s gone. It’s here. There it is. I hear a noise over there. Where is it? It’s gone but it’s over there.”

But it’s a hydrosonic. I call it super-duper, because super-duper is easier for people to understand then hydrosonic. But we have the greatest … two point five trillion dollars we spent. The greatest weapons in the world. The greatest weapons that this world has ever seen without a question, I don’t have to say what they are. In fact, the fake news said, “He just gave away classified information.” I said, “No, I just said we have the greatest weapons. I didn’t tell you what they are.” I could, because as president I’m allowed to do it. I mean, Hillary Clinton is the one that gives her white classified information.
Yeah, Hillary. And how about the idiot John Bolton? I mean, he comes in and all he wants to do is go to war with everybody. If I listened to that idiot, we’d be right now in World War Five. “Sir, we saw some movement in China. I think we should go to war with them. And I think Russia, let’s do them both at the same time. Let’s also go in right now to North Korea.” Hey, do you remember North Korea? We were supposed to be at war with North Korea. What happened? What happened? You know what the press said? They said, it’s amazing. First they said it was amazing and those people lost their job, probably. It’s amazing what I’ve done, they said. No, we’re supposed to be at war. They have a lot of nuclear stuff, it wouldn’t be easy. We’d win, we’re going to win.

Although, I tell you what I took over our military was totally depleted. We had a depleted mil-, we had old planes, we had old everything. It was a depleted military. And now it’s a beautiful brand new … we have F-35s that you can’t see. Stealth, they’re stealth. We have all new rockets, all new missiles, brand new planes, the bombers, the tankers, the jet fighters. What we’ve done is incredible. And we had to do it, somebody had to do it. Somebody said, well, we’re sort of doing some damage to our budget. I said, “Look, I want to have a strong military.” If I see some people, some soldiers from foreign lands, right, walking up or running up the White House lawn, the beautiful south lawn of the White House. I’m not going to be saying, “We didn’t do too well with the military, but we kept it under control in the budget, right?” No, the military supersedes everything.

I don’t know, to me, I’ve always heard the Supreme Court. But to me, the most important thing has always been the military, our defense and our offense if needed. You know, it’s always [ 00:35:36]. Joe Biden should not be asking for your support. He should be begging for your forgiveness and he should be. Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. This building wouldn’t be here if you ever did that one. Which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry and other industries. He supported the horrendous Korea deal, okay. How about the South Korea deal? It’s a disaster. So that was a Hillary Clinton deal, I must say, not him. Although I guess he had … he was vice, Hey, you know what’s interesting with Biden? So he always says, “Why didn’t the president do this. And why didn’t the president do that? And why didn’t do this and that, and this and that.”

That’s been there for 47 years, but he just left like three and a half years ago. You know what I mean, he was there. And I keep saying, “Why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you do it?” Could’ve done it. It’s not like he was 25 years ago. They were there three and a half years ago. Why didn’t you do it sleepy Joe? But the Korea deal and I say it all the time. She said, “This will create 250,000 jobs.” And everybody got all excited, oh, those jobs. The problem was the jobs were all produced in South Korea, so that didn’t work out to well. 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Anyway, I renegotiated the deal in its entirety, now it’s a good deal. That was a rip, I’ll tell you.

And the pro-China Paris Climate Accord, it’s pro-everything, it’s pro-everybody but us. That would have cost us trillions of dollars, and we would have had the privilege of closing down Dayton’s … probably 25% of your companies. You could have never, you could have never done it. It’s an anti-America deal. And you know when I did it, I thought I’d be scorned. People understood that it was a total rip off. They understood it. With every decision, Joe Biden twisted a knife into the hands and heart of the American worker. But these brutal betrayals ended the day I took the oath of office, that’s true. I mean, I saw so much stupidity, the endless wars and we’re almost out of Afghanistan as you know. Not easy to get out because we have people in this country, the military industrial complex. Eisenhower called it the military industrial complex, and it does exist. It’s not easy-

industrial complex and it does exist. It’s not easy to get out, but we’re very close to getting out and getting out of the Middle East. We’re down to very little in Iraq. We’re down to almost nothing in Syria, but I will be honest with you, we kept the oil. Somebody said, “You still have some soldiers in Syria?” I said, “That’s why they kept the oil.” We kept the oil. We should have done that in Iraq. Remember I used to say a long time ago before I was, “Don’t go into the Middle East, but if you’re going to go in and keep the oil.”

Well, we went in and we didn’t keep anything and all the death, the blood in the sand, I call it the blood in the sand, that worthless sand. All of that death that has been caused for no reason. It was the worst decision in the history of our country going into the Middle East. We’re in there now $8 trillion, we’re almost out. $8 trillion and nothing but death and millions of lives if you look at both sides, I’ll look at both sides. Somebody would say, “Oh, I shouldn’t be looking at the other side. I look at both sides/ a lot of innocent people were killed. We lost incredible soldiers. I see the coffins, the caskets come in in Dover and I see it. And I said, “Oh boy, Why, why, why, why. Why did they do this?”

My first week, I withdrew from the transpacific partnership and saved that whole business of so much and what I had to do is I extended for a short time and then totally ended NAFTA. You know NAFTA’s the worst trade deal ever made? Ever made. And we did the USMCA, Mexico, Canada. We have a great deal. And the reason I know it’s a great deal because the other sides are unhappy. You always liked to have an unhappy person at the other sides. No, they’re okay. But they had a free rip at us for years and years and years, NAFTA.

How many buildings, how many factories did you lose right here? Where they moved over to Mexico, moved up to Canada, moved all over the place, but that’s not going to happen anymore. The new deal makes it very prohibitive to do that. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making it really something. You got to do a couple of little expressions it’s called buy American and hire American. You know life is crazy in politics. Biden runs for president like two or three times, right? And I used to call him 1% Joe. And that was primetime for him, right?

Now that primetime is long over, he ends up winning the nomination. Explain that? But had if Elizabeth Warren left and been loyal to her communist ideology, dare say socialist, but it’s communist. It was pretty close. Maybe somewhere in-between heading toward the C-word. But had she left before Super Tuesday, Biden would’ve lost every state, but she took the votes away from Bernie. And Bernie is a nice guy, you know Crazy Bernie. He is the nicest loser I’ve ever seen. When they talk about sportsmanship, he got screwed by Hillary Clinton badly, but not as badly as this time, this was worse.

Because all Pocahontas had to do is leave a day early. She didn’t even have to endorse him. And the votes that she got, which weren’t many, but far more than he needed, because he lost a couple of states by literally a small amount of votes. He would’ve gotten most of those votes. He would’ve won. He would have been the one we fought. I don’t know/ who would have been better? Who would have been easier Sleepy Joe Biden or Crazy Bernie? Tell me.

Sleepy Joe, who says Sleepy Joe? Who says Bernie? I don’t know. It’s hard. Bernie had more spirit. Joe’s got no spirit, it’s dead as a rock. The only spirit he’s got is spirit to beat me. And that’s called the negative spirit. And historically that doesn’t do that well. If you look at old races when somebody’s getting votes because they don’t like somebody, you know there’s an ideology that let’s face it doesn’t like me too much. Somebody said, “We don’t like his personality.” I said, “I always thought I had a good personality.” They don’t like my personality. Who the hell cares about my personality, right? Right?
 
Got to get the job done. See those rough guys over there? I don’t like their personality either, but they get the job done. Right? Who the hell cares? Who cares about their personality? But when Sleepy Joe was vice president and other countries flooded our market… Thank you very much. Who is that? Wow. Good voice. Have you ever tried opera? Good voice. Thank you, darling.

But other countries flooded our market with subsidized washing machines. You remember that disaster? Does anybody know about the Whirlpool plant in Clyde, Ohio? Right? And the head of Whirlpool came to see me. I was president-elect and he called and I don’t know, for some reason I’ve heard of Whirlpool and I’ve heard of it all my life, I guess. I didn’t know much about it. They made washing machines and I never knew, I knew they were dumping steel on us and dumping certain things. But I didn’t know they were dumping washing machines.

And he was a good guy, came up to my office and he said, “They’re putting us out of business, South Korea, China, they’re dumping washing machines.” They make washing machines. They dump them into our market. They put everybody out of business. Then they charge you a lot of money when everyone’s gone. Just like Rockefeller used to do, right? Just like other people do right now, unfortunately, but we’re trying to track them down. And I said, “That’s really terrible.” I don’t know. Somehow it hit me. So we put a 50% tariff on all washing machines coming into our country. And I visited with Jim Jordan. You know Jim Jordan?

You know he’s a great wrestler. One of the best. He was a great, great wrestler. Really a phenomenal wrestler, a real champion, NCAA champion and old Jim. And that’s the way he is. He’s a tough guy. No games, right? No games. That he works with our guys here, your guys. And he was great, but it’s Jim’s area. And we went up and saw the plant and then making thousands a day. I mean, they gave me a number, it can’t be positive. I think they said like 20,000 a day. I said, “How the hell can you make that many washing machines?” But you know what I’m talking about Congressmen, right?

They’re making thousands of washing machines a day and it’s a vibrant company again, it was dead, it was going to close. But I evened up the score, I put the tariffs and now what they’re doing is LG and Samsung, and these companies that made the washing machine they’re now coming into the United States. And in order to avoid the tariff, they’re building plants in the United States and that’s okay and that’s what we should be doing.

We’re going to be doing it a lot more too. We’re going to be doing it a lot more. Biden allowed other countries to target our steel industries and it was like a disaster for our steel industry, but we took historic action to end these practices and place strong tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. And it brought back our steel. Now steel plants are opening or being upgraded in Toledo, Marion, Cuyahoga Heights, Mingo Junction, and all across the Midwest. They were gonzo.

And you know certain industries you need. Some industries you don’t, but steel you need. Steel you need. For defense, you need it. You don’t want to talk war. You don’t want to talk about that, but if we had a problem,” what are you going to do? “Well, we don’t have any steel mills.” Let’s see if we can get some steel from China. “But sir, you’re fighting them. Well, that’s not working out too well.” No, we had to save our steel. We had to save our aluminum industry and we’ve done it. We’ve done a great job, but you have a lot of steel mills going up right here in Ohio.

And a lot of them being expanded. And they’re really state-of-the-art. As vice president, Biden did nothing as China stole our intellectual property, flooded our markets with dumped goods. Unfairly subsidized these industries. Manipulated its currency. They’re the greatest in the world at that. I go to my guys, they said, “What about doing a little movement on the dollar?” “Sir, we can’t do that. It has to float naturally.” Well, China does it. China, you talk about a manipulation. Man, it’s like a yo-yo. Let’s see, let’s raise it. Let’s lower it, lets do this and that.

But we actually called them on it, didn’t we Congressman? Turner, by the way, you did such a good job. You are a hell of a lawyer. You could represent me any day. Actually he did. He actually did represent me. Right? Davidson Turner, what a group. They’re tough. And then you had Jordan into it. They liked him though, don’t they huh? They like Jim. And they poisoned our communities with fentanyl. You know that? Instead, Biden allowed China to ravage our towns, raid our factories and rip apart our communities. That’s what they did. And then he goes in and he brings his son. “Hey, see if you can give him some money. Give him a billion and a half dollars.”

I went to Steve Schwarzman. Steve Schwarzman is like one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, Blackstone. I said, “Steve, what are the chances.” He does a lot of business with China said, “Steve, what are the chances of somebody walking into an office in China and in 10 minutes, walking out with 1.5 billion to manage?” He said, Zero.” He said, “I couldn’t do it and I have this great company.” It’s a disgrace. How about where he points? Then he says, “You’re not getting your billion dollars unless you get rid of that damn prosecutor.” And then they says, “They got rid of the prosecutor. Here’s your billion dollars.”

Does anything happen? Nothing happens. I’m so angry at Republicans. I am. I’m so angry. I am so angry, but a lot of things are happening. You’re seeing, you’re reading the papers also. A lot of things are happening. You know they spied on my campaign and we caught them. And by the way, that’s Biden, that’s Obama. They spied on my campaign. It’s never happened before. It’s treason. Comey and all the sleazebags, they spied on my campaign and we caught them. Let’s now see what happened. I stay out of it. I just say, I’m trying like hell to stay out of it.

I don’t have to actually, but it’s better if I do. I think. Barry is shaking his head sort of like that’s the weakest yes, but it’s true. Right? But it’s true, I’m trying to stay out of it. But it’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. I tell you what, these people are bad people. They’ve done things. What they’ve done to General Flynn and to other people is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And many others, but Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. It’s very simple.

And I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China and their decades of pillaging, plundering, looting, including these massive tariffs. Don’t forget, I charged tariffs. Took in tens of billions of dollars. They targeted our great farmers. Do we have any farmers here? Any farmers? Well, am I correct? We gave the farmers $28 billion. Thank you very much, China. Right? Because they were targeted for 28 over a two-year period, 12 and 16. Right? Did you get your check? And you might not be in business if I didn’t do that.

Good? Good. Thank you, darling. She gave me the right answer. It’s always dangerous to do that. No, I never got the money. No. She got the money. Yeah? But once again, Joe Biden has sided with China over America. Look, you think this guy’s going to be tough in China? His son? No, no. Think of it. And then he takes ads. “He’s going to be tough on China.” This guy, they looted him and Obama. And in all fairness, not just the eight years, this has gone on for 25, 30 years. Probably the biggest reason I decided to run and give up one of the greatest lives anyone’s ever had for this, for this.

But you know why I like it? Because we have done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in the history of the country. And I say that and these fake news people don’t even question it. There’s nobody done what we’ve done. Between our military, between our trade, between our energy independence. All of the things, we could go on forever. But Biden vowed to remove those tariffs. He wants to remove the tariffs. You know when I made the deal with China, I said I have to leave the tariffs on. They said, “You got to be kidding.” They wanted one thing, the removal of the tariffs, and I wouldn’t do it. We wouldn’t do it. I said no.

But Biden said the other day, he wants to take the… He doesn’t know what a tariff is first of all. “Sleepy Joe would like to remove the tariffs off China. They’re paying billions of dollars a year. Could we take them off?” “Absolutely. What are they exactly?” But it wouldn’t even happen that way. The radical left, which likes China, the radical left would walk into his office. And here’s your bill, right? It was supposed to be a speech. I haven’t exactly used it too much today. And they’ll say, “Here President, sign this.” Oh, okay. Do you have a pen? Okay. What was that?” “That’s the deal with China. Don’t worry about it.” That’s what would happen.

But he gave China free rein to continue ransacking the American Heartland. And you know, look, they were targeting you. The reason nobody took on China was China said, “We’re going to go after your heartland.” And they said that to the presidents. And I said, “Go ahead, do it.” And the farmers were the most loyal. They all said, “We’ve got to do it sometime.” They told me that. I mean, they told me that loud and clear. We didn’t lose anything with the farmers. They said, “Somebody’s got to do it.” And I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to let them target you. They’re going to stop buying. We’re going to charge them tariffs and going to give you back the money that you lost, that you were targeted for. And we’re going to have tens of billions leftover for the treasury.” That’s exactly what happened. Nobody else ever told him that.

Joe Biden is weak. He’s too scared to stand up to the radical left of his own party. And he’s terrified of standing up to China, but I believe he’s much more scared of the radical left than he is of China. That’s why China is desperate. You see the reports and news reports. They want Biden to win. They want Biden to win. They want him to win at any cost. If Biden is elected, China will own America. And if Biden is elected, you will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before. It’s very simple. It’s very simple.
Largest tax increase ever proposed. That’s what they’re going to have. Does anybody mind paying more tax? All my life I’ve studied. I like politics. I just always liked it. It’s lucky I liked it because I never did it before. They said, “He can’t run. He’s got no experience.” And now that I look around yesterday, I was in the Oval Office, I said, “Oh, excuse me. Is this the Oval Office?” No, but a lot of it’s common sense. It’s all common sense. That’s why we call it protest. We’re studying some of the things. I’ll tell you one quick story. So we’re building an aircraft carrier long before my term, the Gerald Ford. And they decide on the catapults. You know the catapult? That throws the plane into the air. For years, it’s been 50 years, whatever longer, it’s been steam, simple, beautiful steam … throws her off …

You ever see those airplanes? They go off. They catapult. So I noticed that this ship is never getting done. I came in and they said, “Oh, it’s got tremendous cost overruns.” I said, “What’s the problem?” Well, the catapult system doesn’t work.” “That’s strange because they’ve been building them for years. I wonder why.” You know about this. And I said, “Strange, let me check.” So anyway, I’m supposed to go over and take a tour. I went to take a tour of the ship, find out why it’s so late. I won’t tell you how many billions of dollars it’s over budget. Billions and billions of dollars. But I heard the catapult system and the elevators are no good. Other than that, it’s wonderful. Right?

The elevators that bring the planes up, they don’t work. So if you have a problem, you can get your plans up. They’re down stuck in a garage, down at the bottom. Not too good. So I go over and they want me to meet the admiral, but I said, “No, no, no. I don’t want to meet the admiral yet.” I meet with the admirals a lot. I got a lot of admirals. I like the admirals. “I want to meet with the catapultors.” “Sir, why would you want to meet with the catapultors for?” “I want to find out why the hell the catapults don’t work.”

So I went there and you know they did a new system. It’s electric, it’s all electric. So instead of steam, which is simple and great and powerful and good. And they know how it works for years and years, they decided to go all electric. Now if you take a little glass of water, take this glass of water, you throw it and that’s the end of that. You bring somebody in from MIT, how the hell do you fix it? And we’re dealing with the ocean and rockets being shot at the ship and the rough stuff. Right? But it wasn’t working. So I said, “No, I want to meet with a catapultor.”

So there were five people that came in. One’s been doing it for over 20 years I think he said. I said, “Who’s the boss?” “I am, sir.” I said, “What do you think of our new system of electric catapults?” “Sir, it’s no good, sir.” I said, “That’s not good.” That’s actually it is what I expected it to be on. I said, “So, it’s no good. Right? The system is no good?” “No, sir.” I said, “What do you think of steam?” “Sir, it’s the greatest. That if it breaks down, I can fix it with a blowtorch or this hammer, I can fix it. And if the waves hit it, sir, all it does is cool it down a little bit, sir. It’s actually good for it, good for the surrounding steel.” I said, “So you think it’s better?”

Surrounding steel. I said, “So you think it’s better?” I said, “Why did they do the electric?” Because they are totally inexperienced. Then I wanted to see the architect and I saw a representative, the architect of ship. Now this is a ship that costs $15 billion. And I looked at the architect. I said, “Have you designed a ship before?” And he said, “Yeah, I have.” I said, “You know, they have a $900 million cost overrun for electric catapults, and they’re no good even if they were.” I said to the guy, “Why is it that they did away?” “Sir, we could do it much faster. The thing goes back and forth.” I said, “All right, well, that makes sense.” But the catapulter said, “But sir, it doesn’t matter because it takes one minute and 52 seconds, if you’re Mario Andretti’s team, to get a plane hooked in. So the steam generates during that minute and a half and it’s all set to go. It doesn’t help that it keeps going back and forth.”

I said, “That makes sense. That makes sense.” So it’s $900 million in cost overruns and here’s the story. They spent much more money and it’s no good. Then they have the elevators. Now, tractors use hydraulic, right? You know, they could do anything. Lift up. They go. It can rain. It can snow. Lightning hits the damn thing and nothing happens. The lightning gets hurt. Nothing happens. So they have these big elevators that lift the planes up. You know, the sirens go off. Everything’s beautiful. The problem is the elevators don’t work. So they’re magnetized. They’re lifted by magnets. I said, “Who the hell ever heard?” I know about that. You know, it’s a new technology that’s about 200 years off. So instead of using powerful hydraulic that never breaks, they have magnetized elevators. So stupid. I mean, honestly, so stupid.

I tell you this because you’re workers and you guys understand this. It’s what we do is so stupid. So they have hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overrun for stuff that’s no good. And two years ago I told them it’s no good. You might as well rip it out because it’s never going to work. You put hydraulic in the elevators and you go back to steam and it’s such a shame to see the kind of money that was squandered by people that have no idea what the hell they’re doing. It’s a shame. Yeah. It’s a shame. And you would understand that. I’d only tell that story to really sort of a group like this because you guys understand it. It’s mechanical engineering at a very easy level. It’s easy to understand. Hundreds of millions of dollars wasted for something not as good.
 
For decades. Our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign Wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities. We are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.

When the terrible plague arrived from China, we mobilized American industry like never before. We rapidly developed lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate by 85%. We’ve done such a good job, except in terms of public relations because the press just will not accept that. Think of what we’ve done with the ventilators. Soon, soon, the vaccines and the therapeutics, Remdesivir and other things. Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality than the United States. They don’t want to say it. And now, as you know, you heard today, Europe had a tremendous outbreak. Okay. You know, they say, “Well, Europe, Europe, Europe.” No, we’re doing great. We’re doing great. Sadly, very sadly, I hate it, but they had a big outbreak that caused a stir in the market today. We launched the most ambitious vaccine program ever created. And we will deliver a vaccine before the end of the year, but it could be a lot sooner than that, a lot sooner.

You know, it’s interesting. The Democrats, they’re all saying, “We want a vaccine.” That’s when they thought we couldn’t get it, right? Because if we relied on them, this vaccine would have taken two or three years more because of the FDA, and I’ve mobilized the FDA, and it’s incredible. But it would have taken two or three years more. So when they heard that we were getting the vaccine, they started knocking it. Think of it. So they put politics over life and death. I mean, it’s incredible. By the way, we’re rounding the corner in any event, but we’re going to have a vaccine very soon, is a great vaccine, great, great vaccine. It’s looking really good, really good. And it’s going to be a lot sooner than anyone thought. And it’s pretty sad when the Democrats try and make that into a political issue. Because they’re unhappy. It’s coming too soon. They didn’t think that would happen. We will end this pandemic in the next year. Will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. That’s what’s happening. The third quarter will end just before November 3rd. You will see numbers, the likes of which no country has ever seen. That’s how well we’re doing. You’ll see. And if it’s before, so, they’re not good. I guess you’re going to have to remember that. And if they’re good, I hope you’re going to remember it too, but they’re going to be great. Somebody predicted 25% and then somebody said 35% GDP increase. Nobody’s ever heard of a number like that. But that’s the kind of thing we’re doing.

Under my leadership, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world, and now we are doing it again. In the past four months, we’ve added a record smashing 10.6 million jobs, never been close to that. Four months, 10.6 million jobs. Manufacturing production is up 61%. auto production has surged 500%. And retail sales have soared 112%.
But if sleepy Joe Biden wins, the economy will collapse. It’s going to collapse. Even psychologically it’ll collapse. And you know, as good as the stock market’s doing, it’s a headwind knowing you have an election. Things happen in elections, some bad things, some stupid things. But that’s a headwind. We’d be doing even better if this election were over. If we win and when we win the election, you’re going to see things roar because that’s what people want. That’s what the market wants. And that’s what the workers want. Biden keeps talking about a nationwide shutdown. There is no shutdown. My plan is to crush the virus. Biden plan and Biden’s really plan is to, and it’s not that he wants to crush America, but he will just out of gross incompetence. Biden will surrender to the virus, just like he surrendered to China.

And just like he surrendered to the radical left, including his own running mate who’s running the show. And she’s nothing special. She is nothing. Between her and Elizabeth Warren, what a couple of great ones. What a couple of, what some people? Well, I’ll tell you something. Elizabeth Warren did do a great number on Bloomberg. Didn’t she? I tell you. One question and that was the end of him. How you enjoying politics, Mike? That didn’t work out too well. $1.8 billion wiped out in one question. That was the most expensive question in history.
 To protect our workers during the pandemic, I suspended the entry of new foreign workers who threatened American jobs. I know you don’t mind. You don’t mind that, do you folks? As the economy reopens, I want to ensure American workers that we’re putting America first and our jobs are put first. Our country is put first. Our manufacturing is put first. Everything is now put first for the USA.

And by the way, we’re up to mile 330 on the wall. We’re setting records on not allowing all of these. I mean, some really bad. When you look at the traffickers. They traffic in women and drugs and other things, but they traffic in women, the drug dealers always. Setting records now on the wall because we have 330 miles. We’re averaging 10 miles a week and we’ll be finished with the wall very soon. And it’s had a huge impact.
 So one of the most radical things that will happen, and there’s no way he can get away with this because he was banning fracking for a year. He’s running, running, he’s banning fracking. I said, “He’s gone. He’s gone.” And then all of a sudden, now all of sudden he said, “Well, I didn’t really say that.” He did. Remember, it’s always the first thing they say with a politician. It’s the first thing. He wants to ban fracking and outlaw Ohio energy production.

And you’re a big energy producer, whether you know it or not. So he’s going to ban fracking. There’s no question about it. And even if he didn’t want to, the whole radical left, their plan is to ban fracking. They want to ban fracking. They don’t want any fossil fuels. Just a few days ago, Biden reiterated his plan to require net zero carbon emissions. So you do that. I think it’s wonderful. Close up about 70% of your plants. This requirement would end all investment in fracking and it would just shut down everything. Our country, do you see the rolling blackouts they have in California? I don’t think we want too many of them in Ohio. Do we? Would anybody like a few rolling blackouts? Like we’d like to watch president Trump tonight. I’m sorry, darling, but we have no energy. We have no energy.
 We’re going to get it from the wind. The wind is blowing. The wind, the wind has got a wonderful, wonderful energy. The wind, when it’s blowing it’s just fine for about 20% of the time. By ending fracking, Biden would destroy 700,000 to a million Ohio jobs and your energy prices would go through the roof. When Biden was Vice President, they deliberately killed 40% of all coal mining jobs and the rest were coming fast. I saved it. I put our miners back to work, clean coal. I call it clean coal. Can do a lot with coal. And while I’m President, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. And that’s what we’re doing. And just in concluding, over the next four years, we will build America into the manufacturing, super power of the world. And we will end our reliance on China and all other faraway lands that nobody in this beautiful facility, whatever the hell you make here, I don’t know, but it looks good to me. But nobody ever heard of it. You have lands that would go to that nobody ever even heard of. Where are you sending this money? We’re sending it to such and such a country. I never heard of it.

We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We’ll cut your taxes and taxes for middle class families at a level never seen before. You know, we gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. We gave you the biggest regulation cut in the history of our country. And we’re going to give you additional regulation cuts. That’s one of the reasons you had the jobs. You know, in many ways, the regulation cutting was perhaps as important or more important. You see the tax cutting easier, but the regulation cutting was every bit as important. And we’re going to expand opportunity zones to ensure that no community is left behind. And they’ve been a tremendous success, especially for the African American, Hispanic community. We’re doing incredible. Tim Scott, great Senator from South Carolina. We worked hard on it. Opportunities zones. It’s a big success.

We’ll enforce immigration rules that defend American families, raise American wages, and always put the interests of American workers first. We will enact fair trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? And we will always live by the timeless words of our national motto: In God We trust. And they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. You saw that. I was listening to this Pledge of Allegiance and I said, “That’s strange. They must’ve made a mistake. It must’ve been a typo. Something happened.” But then it happened twice. And then it was getting ready to happen a third time, and somebody heard that the public was enraged, including me by the way. And by the way, we want the NFL to stand and put their hand on their heart. Got to do it. Right?
 I thought we taught them that lesson about two years ago. The commissioner tried it again. It’s not working too well. Not working. The ratings are not good. People are angry about it. People love our country. You love our country. You love our flag. You love our anthem. This November, if you want jobs, if you want opportunity, if you want safety, and if you want a President who defends the dreams of workers in Dayton and Akron and all across Ohio in America, then you need to get out and vote for Trump, Mike Pence. How good is Mike Pence? Trump Pence. And I love Mike, but it’s not Pence Trump, okay? You understand? It’s not Pence. Mike will be the first one to say. You know, when he said that the other day. He said the Harris Biden administration. I said, “That’s strange.” And Mike called me up. He said, “You never have to do that.” I said, “Don’t worry, Mike. I won’t. I promise.” Mike Pence has done a great job. I’ll tell you. He’s a great guy.

Together we will make America safer. We will make America stronger and prouder and greater than ever before. We’re going to make it greater than ever before. And again, this was not a rally. This was a group of people, workers, and this is what it was told to me as, and we had a lot of fun and we have a lot of fun, but it’s very serious business. November 3rd and before, depending on whether or not you have those fake ballots or whatever. Be careful with that. I mean, that thing is going to be one of the great catastrophes. What a mess. And they want it to be a mess. They know it’s no good. I think it’s 11 different races. When they have small races, they can’t account. People steal the ballots. People don’t get the ballots.

They don’t send them to a Republican area or maybe a Democrat area, whatever, it’s still wrong. But it happens to be Republican, unfortunately. But they don’t send them out. Then they harvest them, which they’re not allowed to do. They have in Nevada, the Governor said he signed an order that they don’t have to sign. We need no signature verification. Oh, that’s great. Because they couldn’t get people to sign, so they said, “We’ll just send them in. Don’t worry about it.” This is a real affront to our democracy. This is a horrible thing that’s going on. And the Democrats know it and they say, “Well, he’s not for our great heritage. He is fighting our vote.” No I’m not fighting our vote. You have ballots that you go out and you can get, you could request as you know, you can request them and that’s fine.

But if you’re not requesting them, when you get millions of ballots, 80 million they say all over the United States, where the hell are they going? Who’s sending them? Who is getting them? Who’s sending them back? What’s happening with the transportation? Who’s guarding the lockboxes? They know it’s a fraud waiting to happen. But you know, we’re not talking about 1%, which is no good, because you could lose or win an election by 1%, we’re talking about 20%, 30% in one case, over 40%. This is a disgrace that they’re allowed to get away with. And what they want to do is they want to have a mess at the end of the evening on November 3rd and then fight it out in the courts. And the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves because they know what they’re causing. We love Ohio. We love Dayton. God bless you. God bless Ohio. And God bless America. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.",21/9/20
"Thank you very much Pittsburgh, a great place. You have always treated me well. Thank you, Pittsburgh. Thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be back in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania [ 00:01:51]
Hard working Americans patriots, and by the way, the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, congratulations. Good team. Great quarterback, don’t you think? I think he’s great. Big Ben, right? Big Ben … We’re going to lift our nation to extraordinary new heights. We’re going to turn the page forever on the failed political class, and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing. We’re going to defend our jobs, our families, our borders, and our treasured way of life. Remember, we now put America first, we do it, been a long time. It’s been a long time.

This is the most important election in the history of our country, I believe that. This election is a matter of economic survival for Pennsylvania. You had the greatest year you’ve ever had last year, and you’re really on your way. We were very, very sadly disturbed by what happened with China. They let the plague out, they shouldn’t have done it, but you’re now on your way. We closed it up, we saved millions of lives. That’s the bottom line. We’d closed it up, we saved millions of lives.

I will tell you, you see what’s happening, you see the numbers as well as I do. You are on your way to, I think maybe, economically the best year, this next year will be the best year we’ve had. The third quarter, wait till you look at the third quarter, look at the numbers. They will be out before the election, but I predict they’ll be very good. By the way, if they’re not, I deny I ever said it. I deny it. But, I’m pretty confident they’re going to be incredible probably the best ever.

Under my administration, we proudly achieved energy independence. Don’t forget, I am not the candidate, two candidates that said we’re not going to have fracking. We’re going to ban fracking. He said that for a year. Then all of a sudden, he said, “Well, maybe we’ll have some fracking.” By the way, that’s not going to last because the radical left won’t let him get away with it. I’m all for fracking. I was in Texas, well, it’s a big part of your economy. It’s energy. It’s just a tremendous part, but I was in Texas two weeks ago and my opponent is against oil, guns, and God.
I just spoke to the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, a great guy. He said, “I think you’re up 15, sir.” I said, “Well, the fake news says I’m up four.” He said, “You’re not up four.” I won it by a lot less. Remember last time with you, with Texas, with many states, it’s too close to call. We don’t know. Then, boom, the polls close. They say Trump won, Trump won, Trump won. We won a lot.

I won Pennsylvania because of you. I won Pennsylvania and you had your best year. So I mean, that’s the way it’s supposed to work. I think we’re going to win a lot. Don’t forget, last time I came in, I said I was going to give you the tax cuts as regulation cuts. I said we’re going to do big things with energy, big things with steel. Your steel mills, every one of them would have been closed and gone had I not won, but I said I was going to do all these things. So, it’s tougher. Now, I’ve done everything I said and more. I’ve done more. I’ve done more than I said. So, this should be easier. I hear we’re doing really well. I know we’re doing really well based on, you know, we came in with a lot of your great congressman. I said, “How are we doing?” They said, “You’re going to win it by a lot.” But, we better with it. We got to go out. We got to vote.

But powered by the incredible workers of your state. You are now really, if you look at it, the number one producer, think of it. We are as a nation, your state is, you have no idea how big an energy, you know how big you are in energy. People don’t think of Pennsylvania that way. Do you have any idea? As a nation, we’re the biggest in the world by far not even close and we are energy independent. Think of that.

But no longer is America at the mercy of these foreign suppliers and all of the people that took advantage of us for so many years. We now don’t have to be in other parts of the world. We’re there perhaps to help allies. We’re there perhaps to help good people, but we’re not there because we need their energy, because we need their oil. Instead, we’re the dominant energy producer. We’re going to keep it that way. We’re going to always have it that way. This, by the way, our opponents, they don’t want petroleum products. Okay? They want wind. Let’s open up wind. Let’s have some wind and every once in a while, the wind will blow and you’ll produce a couple of things and then you can close down your plant for the rest of the season. You can watch those birds fly out of the sky. Gee. I always say it’s a bird graveyard under the windmills.

Doesn’t have the power. Doesn’t have the staying power. You see what’s happening in California. Blackouts, rolling blackouts. How would you like that in Pennsylvania? The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Darling, what’s wrong? I can’t watch Trump on television. I can’t watch our president. Darling, we have a rolling blackout. It’ll only be a few hours. I think we’ll be on by two o’clock in the morning, darling, and we can watch a rerun. Now, this is what’s happening. You have rolling blackouts. You have, in some cases, just blackouts. I don’t even call them rolling. Not going to happen to your state.

Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the largest investment in your state’s history. That was all made possible by our pro energy policies. We’ve done it a lot. In Louisiana, we’re building some of the largest plants you’ve ever seen, largest in the world and it’s incredible, all related to energy, but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril, because the radical left maniacs, they don’t want to have anything to do with energy. They don’t want anything to do with, they have different concepts, right? They have the green new deal, whether it will be no energy, almost of any kind. No, it’s crazy. Thought of by AOC plus three. You know AOC?
Not a good student, not good at anything, but she’s got a good line of crap. I’ll tell you. She’s got a hell of a [ 00:09:21] and she’s got them. She’s radical left, but she’s not as bad as some of them. How about Omar of Minnesota?
We’re going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say. He’s telling us how to run our country. How did you do where you came from? How is your country doing? She’s going to tell us, she’s telling us how to run our country. You know what? The Democrats in Congress, you have to see what they are doing. Their stance on Israel, it’s like a whole different world. It’s like from 10 years ago, it’s like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it’s going to be. We’ve got the greatest country on earth and we’re going to keep it that way. We don’t need socialist and we don’t need communist telling us how to run our country.
I do this every night and a lot of times it’s a waste. I did it last night. We were … Did you see the crowd we had last night? We were in a great place, Ohio. We had a crowd. We had a crowd. You couldn’t see the end of it. I said, “Turn around camera, turn around.” But, they never liked doing that, you know? They don’t like spinning those cameras. They don’t want to show the crowd.
They don’t like showing. They don’t like showing, show the crowd and this is … it’s an honor. Let me tell you. Look, I used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can’t turn, but then whenever there was like a problem, like there’d be a little argument or some kind of an anti-Trump person, you don’t see that much. I don’t want to bring it on, but you don’t see it much anymore. You know why? It’s dangerous. It’s dangerous for them, but you know, I’d see the camera would never move, whenever where there’s something like a little negative happening, that thing would turn around like a pretzel. I said, “Oh, it does move.” But, they never want to show the crowds. They never, last night.

Now, I went home and I tell you this, I go home all the time. First lady, “How’d you like the crowd?” Sir, I didn’t see it. I didn’t see it, but I didn’t see it, Donald. I didn’t see it. Sometimes she’ll call me Mr. President, but she’s only kidding. Believe me. She’s only kidding. Has she been a great first lady, right?
She’s been a great first lady and very popular. She’s really done a great job. She works hard. We have some great people here tonight. I brought certain members of my family, but I’m going to introduce them to you in a little bit, okay? Great family. They work hard. I’ll tell you what, they work hard. They really work hard. But I do wish they would show because it would be, you know, it’s actually better for them if they show. It shows the importance. The only thing you can do is show. I’ll say, “How did it look?” I don’t know how it looked, but the sound was phenomenal. Okay? It sounded like a Penn state football game like the Steelers football game. You can’t disguise it. You ever see Sleepy Joe with the little circles? Oh, you can. He puts them very far away, so far away. Then he comes up with the mask. He’s like a hundred yards from the nearest human being. He’s got a … He feels good about the mask. I wonder in the debate it’ll be him and I or the stage. Is he going to walk in with a mask?
I’ll be honest, he feels good about the mask and that’s okay. You know what, whatever makes you feel good. He feels good. He feels, I mean, honestly, what the hell did he spend all that money on the plastic surgery if he’s going to cover it up with a mask. Seriously. No, I think he’ll come in with a mask. I don’t know. I have no idea. Well, the question is, will he leave it on during the debate? Because it’s a little hard and I’m all for mask when you need them, I’m up, but when you’re making a speech and the nearest person’s like where you are and you’re in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he’s speaking, it makes him feel comfortable.

Honestly, whatever makes you feel good is okay with me, but it’ll be interesting. I’m going to be, we’re going to have a big rating on that. He’s been doing it all his life. He’s been doing it for 47 years and I’ve just started doing this stuff. I’m just starting. But, I’m just thinking, but I did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. That’s true. That’s true. You look at what we’ve done.

Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
No, it’s true. That’s actually true. He did a lot of negative stuff too. You have to deduct that out. When asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration, Joe replied, “No, we would make sure that it’s all eliminated.” All of a sudden, he gets the nomination. He’s been trying to get the nomination for decades. He finally get, and that was prime time for him, which was never great. He never got more than 1%. We called it. Remember, I called him his first nickname was 1% Joe.
Frankly, had Elizabeth Warren been loyal to her philosophy, which is radical left, socialism, perhaps communism. I don’t know, perhaps. It’s verging on communism, right? But had she been loyal, she would’ve left. She would have quit. She had no chance. She was out. Pocahontas. She was gone. Remember, I said, ” I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none.” I’d love to have some, but I don’t happen to have any. Then she choked and she went out and got a test. She announced she had 1024th, right? 1,000. That means, like I said it last night, that means around 700 or 800 years ago, somewhere, there was a little bit of a relationship going and that’s okay. Seven, 800 years ago, maybe. What a phony she is. It’s terrible. Now, we’re going to pick a great woman, any one of the five that I told you, but any one of the women that we had they’re all great people, great scholars, great, brilliant people. A lot of people.

No, they’re all great women. They’re brilliant. Great scholars. By the way, while I’m here, would anybody prefer that I pick a man? Is there any man that has the courage to raise your hand? There’s one right there. I got one. We found one. No, we’re going to pick an incredible one, brilliant woman and watch the abuse that she will take. Whoever … The decision’s going to be announced on Saturday, 5:00 on Saturday at the White House. You see, we have tremendous Republican support. Two people. Always got to be two. Always got to be the two. Those two. We have great support from the Republican party, tremendous support. It’s never been this unified before ever, ever and the fake impeachment. We had 196 to nothing Republican support. We had 52 and a half to a half in the Senate. Who is the half? I can’t imagine. I can’t. Buddy was very good today. I have to tell you, he was good. Now, I’m happy. Thank you, Mitt. Thank you.

No, he was very good, very positive statement, but days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions. That’s basically saying, you know what that is? There’ll be no more oil. There’ll be no more gas. There’ll be no more nothing. There’ll be no more industry. There’ll be no more country. That’s what it’s like really. That would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you. I’ll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong and you’re going to be doing fracking for a long time.

I can say the same because you are really big in energy. I can say the same thing to you as I say in Texas. So, they don’t want oil. They don’t want fracking, right? They don’t want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful. It’s not going to do it. It’s not going to do it. So, they don’t like oil. They don’t like the gas. They don’t like God, religion, churches are close. How about these states? They still have churches closed. By the way, your governor hasn’t been so great. You know that, right?
Are your churches still closed? They’re still closed. They’re doing it for a reason. By the way, November 4th, they’ll announce, “We’ve decided to open up.” Okay? They’re trying to make our numbers as bad as possible. So, California’s closed. Pennsylvania’s closed. North Carolina’s closed. Michigan is closed. That’s another beauty right there, Michigan’s closed. Then they have these fake ballots, millions and millions of ballots. By the way, when not if, when you see shenanigans, please report it to your authorities. Okay?
The real authorities, they’re watching and the authorities are watching, but please report it. But when you look at it, really, it’s amazing. They’re trying to make our numbers look bad, but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order, right? Law and order, the red states, the Republican states, they’re working great. Record low crime, record low, but Democrat run states, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, New York has gone through a … We have to bring back. We should draft Rudy Giuliani. Okay? Let’s bring him back. Draft Rudy.

We want Rudy. Rudy, Rudy. I’ll tell you Rudy is amazing, but he did a great job. New York was in big trouble. He came in and he just was tough, smart, and it became the safest big city. Now, we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300%. He fired 1,000. He fired a lot of police, I guess, a billion dollars a year worth of police, worth of great police, firemen and women. It’s a terrible thing. I love that place so much and it’s so sad to see what’s happening to New York. We’re going to make a little bit of a play for New York. In theory, the Democrats automatically win New York, but I do phenomenally in most parts. Then one part, it’s automatic, but I can’t imagine that particular part is going to be very happy. So, we’re going to make a play for New York.
Yeah.

With Pennsylvania, I don’t have to make a play. We’ve got Pennsylvania. Just go out of here. We don’t have to make a play. We don’t have to. It’s a great, you know, for years though Pennsylvania was a place that Republicans just didn’t win. For many years, everybody thought they were going to win, every Republican. So yeah, we’re going to win Pennsylvania. They thought they were going to win it and they didn’t. I came along and we won it and we won it quite easily. Quite easy. I think we’re going to do even better now, because remember, number one in the history of your state last year, and that’s because of what we did, we stopped the dumping. We saved your stell. So many different things, but Pennsylvania is the home of American energy. Think of it that way. This has taken place over a very short period of time. Also, the birthplace of a thing called the American constitution. Right? American constitution.

To uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge, I will soon be announcing that nominee. You’re going to love it. You’re going to be so happy. If you don’t love it, don’t vote for me. Okay? You don’t like it. My opponent refuses to release a list of justices. I was told that a big thing when I was running last time, nobody really knew me. They knew me very well. We had great success at The Apprentice and in business and it was great, but they never knew what kind of a judge I would pick or to be a justice, right? A justice of the Supreme Court. I said, “I mean, what am I going to do? How am I going to solve that problem?” But, I was in politics, never. Don’t forget, when I ran, they said, “No, he’s inexperienced.” I ran against some very talented people. Some of whom are very good friends of mine. Some of whom I don’t like too much. When I don’t like somebody, it last for a long time, but I said, “Well, how do we solve that problem?” I don’t know. They just weren’t believing. The appointment of a-
Just weren’t believing. The appointment of a United States Supreme Court justice was much more important to the voters than I thought. And they’re right, because they will set policy for 50 years and they’ll set policy, whether it’s life, whether it’s second amendment. The second amendment, if I weren’t president, you know the pressure, your second amendment would be obliterated. It would maybe be gone, but at a minimum obliterated, they haven’t touched your second amendment. Not even touched it. Because I’m here to block. I’m a blocking force. I’m like a lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers. I’m a blocking force.

No, they haven’t touched it. But your second amendment would be under siege. So nobody knew. I never knew. You hear about Supreme Court, you know about Supreme Court, you know about other judges, by the way at the end of the first term, we’ll be close to 300 federal judges, including court of appeals, which I think is a record. I guess it’s a record. It’s a lot. That’s a lot. Nobody’s done that. It’s record. Think of that. 300. That’s a big percentage of the entire judiciary. Think of that. 300. And many, many court of appeals judges, but two great Supreme Court judges or justices. And now we’re going to get a third. Can you imagine our enemies? Three in one term. So many presidents, they just don’t have the chance and it’s so important. But I said to my people, I said, so if they don’t believe me, what I’ll do is I’ll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we’ll tell them, “I will only pick from that list.” They said, “That sounds like an interesting idea.” This was my idea. When you’ve never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination.

So I got out a list, I named the people, the people are good, and I said, “And I promise that I will pick someone like the people on this list.” And it didn’t work. It went nowhere because they didn’t trust it. They said, “We want you to pick the people on the list, not somebody like the people on the list.” So I went back the next week, I said, “I will pick somebody that’s on this list.” And they were all great, great judges for the most part, I think almost entirely, but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country, solid, incredible people. And as soon as I did that, things went through the roof. It was amazing how important it was.

By the way, would you stand up with that beautiful jacket? I love this guy. How many times- How many events? He’s been to a couple. That’s really great. Thank you very much. I’ve seen him before. He’s been here a couple of times, like about 90. Thank you, man. That’s really nice. I’m going to get one of those jackets. By the way, the wall. The wall, yeah, 330 miles. 330 miles. 330 miles. And yes, we have a great relationship with Mexico. First they said, “He’ll never be able to build it.” The Democrats were just brutal. I made a terrible mistake, I said it last night, I should have said, “We will not under any circumstances build a wall at our Southern border.” They would have given me all the money in the world. But stupidly, I said, “We will build a wall.” And the Democrats said, “Let’s not give it to him.” But we got it, we won. We won court cases, we won court cases.

I won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted. So then they said, “All right, all right.” They’ve lost. So by the way, we’re up to 330, the exact wall. Their dream choice. I said to the border patrol, I love these people, they’re great, ICE, the border patrol, what they do is incredible. They’re incredible. I said, “Give me your dream wall, as long as we’re building we might as well build a wall that you want. Let’s build it right.” “Sir, we have to have vision. We need steel and concrete.” I said, “How about one or the other?” They said, “No, sir, we need steel and concrete. We need steel. Inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they’re 30 feet tall. We need all sorts of things. We need them to be wired.” I won’t tell you why they’re wired, but they’re wired for a reason. They’re all wired up and they’re incredible.

But you know what? We got the wall. Nobody could have done it. So once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles, 200 miles, now we’re at 330, and we’re building 10 miles a week and it’ll be finished very soon. And we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking, trafficking coming along and we’ve done phenomenally well. Because that’s a lot of the territory that we need. We’re going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles, so we’re at 330. But once they saw that I had it, they said, “Yeah, but Mexico’s not paying for it.” But they are paying for it, Mexico’s paying for the wall. They are paying for it. They’re paying at the border. They’re paying for the wall. All those trucks that go back and forth. They’re paying for the wall.

So the Democrats said, “Yeah, but Mexico…”, they always have to find something, right? And do you remember what I used to say that if they fight us, remember people would say, “What happens if they fight you on the wall? What happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall?” I said, “The wall would get 10 feet taller.” Took a little hit on that, we took a little bit of a hit, but that’s okay. The wall is a tall sucker, you don’t want to get up to the top. They look down, they say, “Oh, ye, ye, how do we get down off this?” It’s tall and it’s strong and it’s great. And we appreciate, because Mexico has been working with us very closely. They have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border making sure that people don’t come into our country. I want to thank the president of Mexico. Very helpful.

So I made this list of potential justices and I’ll tell you, it all changed. Now I’m asking sleepy Joe Biden to give me a list and he doesn’t want to do it. You know why? Because he can only put super radical left judges on, people that would destroy our country, people that would destroy your country. And he knows that he’s not electable… He shouldn’t be electable anyway. This is the worst candidate. You know where he is today? They have a thing called the LID. I don’t even know. Do you know what LID stands for? LID. He put out a LID today early in the morning. LID means he’s not going to be anywhere today. I’m working my ass off, I’m in Ohio, I’m in Texas, I’m in Florida, I’m in Michigan, I’m in Wisconsin.

Man. Thank you. That’s so nice. Well, that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there, they said they’ve never heard of that one. “There was a chant that’s going over the last six or seven rallies saying, ‘We love you.'” That’s never happened to a politician before. Am I a politician? I don’t want to be a politician. I don’t think of myself as a politician. But it really is, I appreciate it. I’ve never heard it. I liked Ronald Reagan, but they never said we love you, or maybe they did. They’re going to try and find out. Then they’ll say, “President Trump lied last night because 40 years ago I remember…” But no, nobody’s ever heard that one before and I appreciate it because it is reciprocal. Thank you very much. Reciprocal. Reciprocal love. It’s reciprocal.

I had such a nice life before I did this. I had such a nice life. Then I had the witch hunt that goes on forever. It goes on. And then we catch them spying on our campaign. How about that? Let’s see what happens though. But we caught them spying, all of that, the whole big deal. And then the guys that were doing the investigation, they have their 31 different phones, they were accidentally wiped clean. 31 different phones, I think it was like 19 different people, and they all did the same exact accident. Which if you knew anything about phones, it’s almost an impossibility to do it once. Let alone 31 different times. So we caught them and that’s called obstruction. We have to remember that’s called obstruction.
That was the Mueller group. That was a Mueller group. All those phones, they were wiped so clean. And Hillary got a subpoena on the 30. I said, “Forget about these things because you’ll find them. They have them. They’re in the state department.” I have no doubt about it, they’re in the state department but they’ll get them. But you know what? 33,000, they have a request from the US Congress, that’s not bad, US Congress they send a subpoena, very, very important, and after getting the subpoena, she deleted all of her emails and acid washed, and then she took her telephones. I’ve gotten rid of phones too. I throw them away. She took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away. And they found a couple of them. She was very angry, obviously, if she did the hammer work. But if anyone else said this, there’s a protection, there’s a dual level of justice, but we’re getting down to the bottom of it because it’s not fair to us. Not fair to us.

33,000 emails. She deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughter’s wedding, Chelsea, and also yoga classes. 33,000 emails on yoga and a wedding. I don’t think so. And Comey said, “Oh, that’s okay. That sounds like a good reason.” That’s Comey. That’s another beauty right there that Comey. But we caught him, we caught him. Very smart move. Getting rid of that guy was a smart move, but we caught him. Listen, we caught him. They were spying on the campaign, they were doing actually worse than that. Nobody’s ever done a thing like this, so let’s see what happens. But we caught him cold, we got so much stuff.

Remember the insurance policy, right? From Strzok and Page, two lovers. They were very smart. They would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didn’t want to be caught having an affair. So they went over the public. That was a very good thing for us. Wasn’t it? ” Darling, darling, darling, please. She’s going to win. She’s going to win, isn’t she? Peter, Peter only you can save us. Peter, she’s going to win. Yes, darling. She’s going to win. I know. 100,000 to nothing.” Remember that? It was actually 100 million to one. This was a hundred million to one. This is this idiot. So listen, “So darling, please, please tell me again. Yes, 100 million to one she’s going to win. But just in case she doesn’t, we have an insurance policy.” Now that only means one thing. And we went through the insurance policy and we caught them. So let’s see what happens to these treasonous crooks. These terrible people. And they put our nation through turmoil. But I just want to thank… A lot of people were very unfairly treated. You look at General Flynn, look, he’s still going through it. Can you believe it? But a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous, horrible people. And they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup. Wouldn’t you think? Who would ever think this country… But that’s all you can say. Some people would say, “Well, that’s a conspiracy theory.” No, just take a look at the records.
For me, it’s a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible. Now let’s see what happens. But we have them cold, they spied on our campaign. It’s our campaign And if you want to save America, you have to go out, get out and vote. This is the most important election. In just three and a half years we’ve secured America’s borders, which makes them very unhappy, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, we built the military. It was totally depleted when I took over. We built a military. Two and a half trillion dollars we spent, all made in the USA, the greatest equipment, the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear. I hate to even mention the word and hope to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world. And we did that over a very short period of time. Weapons that are so powerful that we’re the envy of the world, but I never want to use those weapons. And hopefully we’ll never have to. You know the way you don’t have to use them, is when you have them. It’s when you have them. But nobody’s ever built force like what we have.

And the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said, “He just gave away classified information!” I said, “No, I will look you right in the eye,” first of all, I’m allowed to do it, I’m the president, so I’m allowed to actually. I’m the only one that’s allowed to. But no, no, I didn’t give away. I’m just telling you, most powerful weapons ever produced we have, and other countries know that. And it’s a good thing that they know it and I don’t think we’ll ever be using them. And I hope we don’t. I hope to God. I use the word God, because they refuse to use the word God in their pledge of allegiance, right? Twice. I use the word God. I hope to God, we never have to use them.
But I obliterated the ISIS caliphate, which was all over the place. 100%. Remember I got it down to 99%. They said, “You got to go a hundred.” I said, “Let’s get out of here. We’re bringing them all back home. Everyone’s coming back home.” Long, long wars. The never ending wars, the endless wars. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, they were a disaster, brought jobs and factories back to Pennsylvania under 16 years. And think of this, for 16 years presidents, Obama, President Bush, household income rose $2,945. That’s over a 16 year period. In three years, your household income rose almost $10,000. When you include energy. You have to include energy. Without energy, almost $7,000. But we have to include energy. I mean, how much are you paying for your gasoline? You never saw $2 gasoline. Less, right? It’s less. They go up, it’s less. It’s a big difference. What is it nowadays? Come on, tell me. I haven’t got any gas. I haven’t stopped recently at a gas station. 15? Okay. Because for a while it was way under two. And we’re going to keep it there. We have so much, we have so much.

In my first three years we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country, by far. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And right now we’re doing it again. I see all these hats, Make America Great Again. And now I’m going to say this, Make America Great Again, Again. Make America Great Again, Again, Again.

We saved 1.4 million jobs in Pennsylvania alone and to fight the China virus, it’s the China virus, not the coronavirus. Corona sounds like a place in Italy, a beautiful place. It’s corona. No, it’s the China virus. They don’t want to say it. The radical left, they don’t want to say it. You ever notice they’re always going to have to Russia. Look, nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me. “Russia, Russia, Russia.” I said, “What about China?” They never going to to mention it. They got little deals going on I think. But coronavirus, doesn’t it sound like Italy? A beautiful villa. Corona. No, it’s a China virus. They should have stopped it.
To fight the China virus we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We did an A+ job, except we did a D job in terms of public relations, explaining it because we were too busy doing it. But the fact is they wouldn’t have written it anyway. It didn’t matter to them. It’s there. It’s their little thing. You have a watch Biden? He can’t talk about it he thinks, so he gets up, “The coronavirus,” they say, “We want to talk about Supreme Court judge today.” Well, I don’t know about that. “The coronavirus.” And he doesn’t know we did a great job, he has no clue. He said, “I should have opened.” He goes, “I should have shut down one week earlier.”

What he doesn’t say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu. It was a joke. And what he did, his own man, that was in charge said recently, “We had no idea what the hell we were doing. It was a total disaster.” There were amateurs. And now he tells us how to do something that’s far more lethal. But he said, ” They should have closed one week early,” except when it came to closing the border, which I did, which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives, Biden criticized me until two months later when he said I was right. But we should have closed a weak earlier. Think of that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. Remdesivir, the plasmas, we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country. Nobody knows that.
And I am devastated to see it happening, but you see what’s going on in Europe again. They were always saying, “Oh, Europe is doing better.” Actually we did better, but now Europe has a big spike, a big spike. So they’re not talking about that. The number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47% and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down, visits to hospital. Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. They’re liking to compare us to Europe. 50% greater excess mortality rate. Our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed. You’ve heard about it, they don’t want to talk about it. What we’ve done in a record period of time with the ventilators, now we’re building ventilators for the world. Very hard to do. We’ll develop and distribute a vaccine very, very shortly in record time, it would have been two or three years, four years, if Biden’s group had done it, but we’ve done a great job with the FDA in clearing a path and you’ll be seeing it very shortly. And these are great companies that are doing it.

So we’ll crush the virus and our opponents will, with him, they will crush America. We can’t let it happen. This country is too great. Our love of each other is too great. This guy doesn’t know he’s alive. He really doesn’t. He doesn’t know he’s alive. He did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died. And it was such a disgusting thing. I said, “The only good thing about it is now I can take the gloves off.” This guy doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t know where the hell he is and they’ll give him a shot of something. I don’t know, he’s going to get something. Because I watched him so badly, he performed so badly in the debates, and then with Bernie, he was average, not great, but he got through and I said, “What the hell is he taking?” And we’d like to ask him. And I said that, “We want a drug test, we want a drug test. We’ll both take it. We’ll both take it.” Because with Bernie he was able to get through.
But listen, it wasn’t Winston Churchill. This wasn’t the greatest, but he got through, it was fine. Him and Bernie screaming at each other, mostly Bernie. Crazy Bernie. He’s not too happy. I’ll tell you, did you ever see a better loser than Bernie though? Seriously. He’s a good loser. He got terribly treated by Hillary and that group. And then it happened again with Elizabeth Warren, right? It happened again. What the Democrat party did to him. And then you have this guy, Mike Bloomberg, mini Mike, one question and he was gone. There goes 1.8 billion out their window. I said, “You think it’s easy up here, Mike, don’t ya?” One question and that was the end. He said, “Where am I? Get me the hell off of this platform.” Mini Mike, mini Mike.

So now he’s trying to buy into the party. You would think after the way they treated him, they called him every name, Pocahontas destroyed him, she didn’t do good against me, but boy did she do good against Mini Mike. I figured he’d be calling and saying, “Listen, I want to become a Republican.” We’ve done great for the economy, you’d think. But he always wanted to run for president, and he tried before, I guess, but he tried and it was a bad experience. And you would think he would have joined our party. But instead he’s trying to buy his way back in. When somebody treats you that way, even stay neutral, don’t go back in. He wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship. And one thing you learned about politics, I spent a fraction of the money that crooked Hillary spent. They raised $2 billion. I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money…
I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money, like 35%, 30%, and we won. Nobody ever says that. It’s not about money. It’s about other things. There are other things involved. It’s not just about money.

In the old days, my father would teach me, “If you can win and spend less, that’s a good thing.” I remember after I won and I won decisively look, 306 to 223. That’s a lot. 306 delegates, 306, that’s decisive. We won Michigan and we’re going to win it again. We’re up in a poll just now. Oh, they’re going crazy. They’re going crazy. We won Wisconsin. We won Pennsylvania.
But my father taught me. He said, “If you can win and spend less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.” Like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don’t go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country, like when I get along with Putin, when I get along with Kim Jong-un. Whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with North Korea? Nothing happened. They said I gave away so much. I said, “What did I give away?” They couldn’t find that anything. I didn’t do anything. They said, “You met.” “Oh, I met. Oh, okay. I met.” Now you would have been in war with her. You would have been in war.

But if you can spend, think of this, if you can spend less money and win, that’s a good thing. So after I won one of these people back there, right back there-
… in order to keep the thing going on Trump, I had won, he said, “But Trump raised substantially less money than crooked Hillary Clinton.” That’s because I didn’t need the money. I didn’t need the money. I can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money, but I feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that, it’s like you’re sort of … It’s not the same. I could call up every guy. They call me up and they say, “Sir, how are you, sir? Mr. President, sir.” I have friends see.

I don’t have too many friends up because I used to be comfortable. You have to be comfortable with people, right? I have friends, I have one friend, Richard. I talk about him all the time, but multiply this times a hundred people. Richard used to call me up five, six years ago. “Hey, let’s have dinner.” “All right. Where do you want to go?” “I don’t know. Go to some crazy restaurant.” Today the restaurants are all closed in New York. They don’t want to open them. They want to make them do badly until November but don’t worry, they’re opening in November 4th. But it’s true.

So, it’s Richard on the phone, Richard, my friend for many, many years. I said, “Hey Richard, how are you doing?” “Mr. President sir, how are you?” I said, “Well … ” He’s been calling Donnie and Don and DJ, and all. “Richard, are you okay? Everything good?” “Yes, sir. Mr. President, sir. You’re doing a great job and I’d like to thank you.” “Good, Richard. Richard, loosen up please. You don’t have to call me Mr. Parson.” I said, “Just call me Donald. It’s okay.” “Thank you Donald. I really appreciate it.”

And you hear the guy can’t breathe. He’s having a hard time breathing. He’s very nervous. Then at the end of the phone, he goes, “Mr. President again, thank you so much for the job you do,” and he hangs up. I said, how can you be friends with … ? It just doesn’t work. It’s like, I’ve lost a lot of people this way. It’s called respect for the office. They have respect for the office. They really do. Nothing wrong with it. I sort of understand that. They have respect for the office. Nobody has more respect for this offices than I do. That’s why I’m doing a great job, and I’ll always do a great job. It’s respect for the office.

But on November 3rd, Pennsylvania, will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before, or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn’t have a clue, to kill the recovery, raise your taxes, delay the vaccine.
So he wants to impose a $4 trillion tax. Do you believe? 4 trillion. Ban American energy, which means what? Hey, let’s go back. Let’s call up the Middle East and let’s be real nice to them because we need their energy. No, thank you.

Destroy your suburbs. You know, I got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs. Destroy your suburbs. I call it the Obama Regulates. They’re building nice projects right next to your beautiful home. Lots of luck.

Give free healthcare. I hope the people in the suburbs … When I did this, I took a lot of heat. I got rid of a regulation. They all said, “Sir, we’ll amend the regulation. We’re going to amend it.” I said, “I don’t want to amend it.”

A couple of stories where written. I wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories. They were written by people that say, “I can’t believe a president had the guts to do it.” I did because I want to save the American dream. By the way, a big part of the American dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don’t want to be next to a project.

So all you people in the suburbs that say, “I don’t know, I’m making up my mind.” Cory Booker was the one that was going to lead it out. He was going to be the one. He wants it to be … wants those projects to be nice and big. I just hope you’re going to remember that, sooner than November 3rd, because you can do it sooner, give free healthcare to illegal [ 00:53:59].

So, the problem with free health care … We all have a heart, we all want to take care of people. The problem is when you promise free education, free healthcare, all this up and free healthcare. Remember sleepy Joe during the debate? “Who wants to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants?” Everybody immediately raises their hand, radical left, raises. Joe, do you remember? That’s a classic. He’s [ 00:54:23]. Remember? Sleepy Joe.

He’ll do it because he has no choice because they have total power. He’s like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies.
To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission.

We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day. We’re not going to let it fail. The Democrat party has joined forces with flag burners, anarchists, anti-police people, they’re extremist.
Agitators. And then they say, “Oh no, no, this was a peaceful protest. This is a peaceful protest.” They know what I’m talking about. They know our great uniform. Brilliant. We love them, but you know what? We call it a peaceful protest now, because the only thing you’re allowed to do in Pennsylvania, can’t go to church, right? You can’t meet, you can’t congregate. You can’t look at each other. You can’t give your wife a kiss goodnight. You’ve got to wear a mask. You can’t do anything.

They got you closed up. “Don’t go out to dinner, stay where you are.” Michigan, same thing like the governor. Her husband went boating. It was a disaster because nobody’s allowed. He was the only boat. He had this massive, beautiful lake. You know the lake I’m talking about. It’s a big lake.

Then the guy tried to put a boat. “Who is it?” “It’s the husband of the governor.” That didn’t work out too well for her. But the only thing you’re allowed to do is protest. They have a line. You can’t go to church. You can’t be with your neighbors, but if you’re going to protest and burn down stores, and loot stores and shoot people and step on people’s faces and do all sorts of bad things that these people will protect you from doing if they were given their rightful power and dignity. So they have a clause; stand up, fellows, stand up
They’ve got to be able to do their job. You’ve got to let them do their job. Got to be able to do your job, right? They let you do your job, you’d see. You’d see Pennsylvania, not some big, bad crime numbers in your state. You let them do your job. Any state, New York’s finest.

By the way, I got endorsed by New York’s finest. First time they’ve ever endorsed. And you know that’s hard when you have radical left running the city, all politicians, the mayor. I got endorsed by the Chicago Police. Can you imagine that? I got endorsed by Oklahoma and I got endorsed by Texas and Louisiana. I got endorsed by Florida, the sheriffs. All the sheriffs got together, they endorsed Trump.

I got endorsed by law enforcement, everybody. But how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don’t respect the job you do, and don’t let you do your job most importantly? Because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world, you wouldn’t have problems.

These are other police departments. You look at Seattle. We said we’re going in, and they immediately said, “We’ll put up our hands.” It was so easy. We were going in the following day.

You look at Portland. How about Portland? It’s like an anarchist’s dream. We’re dealing with the governor, because you know, I hate to say it, but they’re all Democrat-run cities and states. All of them, every single one. The Republicans are doing great, but they have to ask. By law, they have to ask us to go in.

So, we did it in Minneapolis. You saw that, but it was too late. Was it like 10 days? The police are excellent, but they’re not allowed to do their job. Now, they wanted to defund the entire department. There’s not going to be anybody to protect you, and the people are starting to go wild. That’s why I’m going to win the state of Minnesota. I’m going to Minnesota. That’s [ 00:59:10].

But do you remember that beautiful day? It was 10 days late. You had these people from CNN and other places. “These are friendly protests.” That’s a lovely thing to say. As he’s getting rocks and cans of tuna fish. They go out to buy tuna fish and soup. You know that, right? Goya. I hope Goya, he’s great, isn’t he? Good guy.

They go out and buy Goya because they throw it. They throw it. It’s the perfect weight, tuna fish they can really rip it, and that hits you. No, it’s true. Bumblebee brand tuna, and you can throw it at soccer, you can a curve on it. You can do whatever else you want. The cops in Chicago, you saw, they’re going like this. It was terrible. They’re not allowed to fight back. They’re not allowed to fight back. These guys if they fight back, nobody’s going to be there very long throwing things.

But they’re professionals, they’re anarchists. They’re paid for by outside stupid rich people that … They’re stupid people. By the way, you know the first ones that get wiped out? They don’t have a shot by the way, I’ll tell you that, but if they ever did, the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff. Those are the people that would get wiped out.

But you know, they’re very smart. Everything is perfect. Do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag? Then they drop, everyone picks them up, throws them at our great police. We’re not going to let that stuff happen, but this is all a Democrat. It doesn’t happen with Republicans.

I was with Greg Abbott. I was with Ron DeSantis, Texas and Florida and other governors that can’t even believe a thing like that could happen, but they get caught. They’re walking up. There’re like 30 cans of soup. They have like 25 cans of tuna. They get caught. “I’m bringing this home to my family. How dare you stop me?” No, no, no. They use it as ammunition. It’s terrible.

So, we said to the governor, we said, “We want to go in and we want to take over Portland. It’ll take us literally a half hour, maybe less. We’ll march … ” And you saw a little dose of it. Minneapolis, the governor finally said, “Go in.” We have the National Guard. Remember that beautiful sight? The street was a mess. That idiot reporter from CNN got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down, “I’ve been hit. I’ve been in.” He’d been hit. The one with the shaved hair, shaved … Maybe I’ll do that one day. I’ll give it up shaven. But he went down and he didn’t like it. He was hit. “Police brutality.” You remember that?

What these people would do, they’re throwing rocks and throwing everything they can at the police. Okay. Now the National Guard forums and we just saw the one guy come out in a black uniform. The uniform costs approximately $250,000. They got infrared stops. They got. They walked in, and they’ve got the tear gas. They’ve got everything you can possibly have. Pepper spray.
They don’t want you to use tear gas anymore. In some places like I think in Milwaukee, they said no tear gas, no pepper spray. How the hell do you keep big crowds back? You can’t. So the police all quit. They all quit. They said, “We can’t do it.”

But you remember, they went out and you had one, then you had two, three, four, then you had five, six, seven. All of a sudden they started pouring in. They were getting off the buses. They came from a different locale, and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately. In fact, I was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other. They were right next to each other. They were touching arms and they had big, strong arms like these guys right over here. There were big strong guys. That’s all right. They were like together.

Then you saw the first line. Then you saw the second line, then you saw a third line, and then you saw a fourth line. Then they said, “March.” They never halted. Just walked right through, cleaned everything up, and Minneapolis was cured. They were cured.

They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They were grabbing them left and right. Sometimes they grabbed, they grabbed one guy, “I’m a reporter. I’m a reporter.” “Get out of here.” They throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn.

But no, but I mean, honestly, when you watch the crap that we’ve all had to take so long, when you see that, it’s actually … You don’t want to do that, but when you see it, it’s actually a beautiful sight. It’s a beautiful sight.

They had the same thing on some other streets and the whole thing was gone. I haven’t heard of any real problem in Minneapolis since that happened. I mean, they were just burning down the city and that idiot was standing there. “This is a friendly protest” Behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was … I’d never. It’s a classic. I don’t know. Anybody, you know what I’m talking about? Is it …

So, I just have such respect, but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best. You have to let them do what they … It’s called law and order. We need law and order. So, Democrat phenomena.

If they win, Sleepy Joe, if they win, because he has no power over these people, these people are crazed lunatics. If they win, your cities will be like this. You’ll lose all rights. Your constitution will be worthless. It’ll be a terrible, terrible thing. I’m not even sure that, after some time listening to that and going along with it, I’m not even sure the country can ever recover. That’s how bad it would be. I’m not sure it could ever recover.

Over Labor Day. Left-wing radicals rampaged through Pittsburgh, harassing diners at restaurants. I saw that one. That was horrible.
No, I saw that, right? I saw that. That one guy grabs a woman, a older woman, she’s eating a steak. He grabbed the steak and started eating it, then he threw it back on the plate. An outdoor place, and her husband standing there like they’re afraid for their lives. It was a terrible thing, and should never be allowed to happen. A thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started. That was terrible. Remember that? An older woman.

Last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant, over 100 rioters rampaged in Lancaster. Went to school right nearby. Looting businesses, setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass. You saw that.

Joe Biden has the support of violent left wing extremists. He never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire Democrat National Convention. Never once. They didn’t talk about the riots, they didn’t talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police. They didn’t do it. They didn’t talk about it. It’s not a subject. They will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about, they will go to your suburbs next. I have the support of America’s law enforcement heroes. I was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country. We’re endorsed by everybody. We’re joined by Butler County Mike Slupe. Thank you, Mike, as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations, oh that’s nice, to become Republicans. They were long time Democrats. Who are those two showers?

Wow. Thank you. It’s Fayette County Sheriff James Custer and Forest County Sheriff, Bob Wolfgang. Where’s Bob? Stand up, fellows. Thank you.

Were you long time Democrats? How the hell did that happen? Well, this is somewhat of a phenomena. This is somewhat … This is crazy what’s going on now. It can be stopped so easily, and you guys know exactly what I’m talking about. Thank you very much. It’s an honor to have you in the party. Thank you. That’s great. There’s a whole great group of sheriffs and law enforcement here.

Also, with us, our Congressman Guy Russian Reschenthaler. Guy. Where’s Guy? Great warrior. Where are they sitting? And a friend of mine and a warrior. He’s a warrior. He’s tough as hell. They said, “We want to impeach the president for making a perfect phone call.”

Oh, did you hear today? They want to impeach me again. They said, if I submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the Supreme Court, they want to impeach me. They want to impeach me if I’m following the constitution.

No, think of it. This is crazy Nancy. These people are stonecold crazy. Think of it. I got impeached for making a perfect phone call. Perfect phone call. Everybody read it. Nobody to this day … and the Republicans stuck together. It was great.

Also, a friend of mine and he wanted to just rip them apart, I remember when he heard about it. He’s a rough guy and he’s a popular guy too. They love him. Congressman Mike Kelly. Thank you, Mike. Come on up here. Come on up here. Just come up. Come on up. Mike, come up. Come on. Guy, come up. Congressmen Glenn Thompson, Congressman Dan Muser, come on. And Congressman Scott Perry. Thank you, Mike. Hey Mike, good shape. Come on, get up there. Oh what a group. What a group. Thank you.

Thank you. We also have a candidate here for Congress. This is a candidate who is the real deal. He is tough as hell. He’s no lamb, no lamb. I don’t know if you can get over that, but this guy could get over there and rip it apart of [ 01:10:00]. They have big security over here. That’s okay. Secret Service. That’s okay. Come on up here. Sean Parnell, who has my complete and total endorsement. [ 01:10:14].
He’s the real deal.
Conor lamb is just a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer. You know crying Chuck? He cries every time he thinks it’s appropriate.

Now, I’ll tell you what. This Conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony. When he was running … It’s a very Trump … they like me. I thought he was a Republican because his ads were so good. “We have to respect our president. We have … ” I said, “This guy’s doing some beautiful ads,” and then I found out he was a Democrat. I’ll tell you what. He’s nothing compared to Sean. Sean is the real deal. Thank you so much.

Just give a little hand, because he’s done a hell of a job too. Our campaign chair, Bernie Comfort. Thank you, Bernie. Bernie Comfort. Thank you. Thank you to Bernie Comfort. Thanks, Bern. All right. While you guys are standing behind me like a beautiful curtain there … Well they’re not blocking Air Force One so we could … But I have a woman with us tonight who has devoted so much. She gave up her business. She said, “Dad, I’m going to come to Washington and help you. I love you daddy, and we’re going to help people. I don’t care and … ” She was very successful in every way, and it’s my daughter Ivanka.

I just want to thank this group of people. And a man that helped, we just negotiated a major peace deal in the Middle East. Everyone said it was impossible. You know that, right? They said it’s impossible. They’ve been killing everybody for years and years, they had this guy, John Kerry, who’s grossly incompetent. They paid $150 billion to Iran, they paid 1.8 billion in cash. That’s even more impressive, frankly, in cash, that’s John Kerry. And we just made a deal with Bahrain and UAE, United Arab Emirates, and Israel, and it’s a great thing. And the man right there, Jared, the abuse, the abuse he takes, but he did something that nobody’s been able to do, and he wants none of the glory, he’d rather not come up here. These guys will come up 100%. Jared, great deal, great job. Incredible. Everyone’s talking about it. We have plenty of other countries going to join and there’s no blood in the sand. Okay. Thanks honey. Thank you.

Great people. Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Sean. We have spent the last four years reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 40. They like Sean. Sean, will you please win? Sean Parnell. I’ll tell you, he’s popular. That’s great, Sean. We love Sean. But Biden championed every globalist portrayal of Pennsylvania for half a century, he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country, NAFTA and China’s entry into the world trade organization, which built China like a rocket ship. They were flat lined for many, many decades and then right through the roof, that was a Biden approval. These disasters ripped out one third of your state’s manufacturing jobs. You know what happened. Biden shouldn’t be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a terrible job.

Now the Democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. You want to spend a lot of money for nothing? Eviscerating your state’s economy, you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really, it takes away your power, it takes away your energy. You’ll be closing your plants and factories all over the place. I withdrew from it. And you know what, the people that understand, the smart people, they said, “I can’t believe you had the guts to do it.” And I figured I was going to be absolutely killed on this one. And you know what, I’m so proud I did it and people get it. It was a rip off of the United States.

I withdrew from the catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pittsburgh, not for Paris. This election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, if Biden wins, China wins. When we win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, back home in the USA where they belong. All coming home.

During the pandemic, I’ve suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs. As our economy reopens, I want to ensure that Americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages. America first. Biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace US workers. You know that. And that’s why never, never, I see his say, hire American. He got it for me, all the words he’s got there, are my words, right? Do you ever see it? They say he copied my campaign. I keep saying, what the hell happened for 47 years and now he’s copying my campaign. As president … and you know it’s not going to happen with him, as president, I know my first duty is always to take care of you, the American worker. That’s what we’re taking care of.

Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing that wall, it’s going to be done so fast. It’s got to be done so fast. Since 2017 ICE has successfully arrested nearly a half a million illegal aliens with criminal records, including over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex offenses and 5,000 murderers. If you don’t mind, Democrats will bring them the hell out of our country, we’ll get them out of here. Some of them are so violent, we have to keep them. We don’t want to house them for 50 years, but if we let them go, they come back in, as much as we watch. If they come back in, we don’t want it, we don’t want them. So we keep them here, we have no choice. If the left gains power, they will abolish … Republicans will always … they’re going to abolish. Republicans will always stand with these incredible heroes of ICE and border patrol.

You have to see these ICE people. They go into a den of MS13, and they call them a den, a nest, where you have these guys that are vicious, vicious gang members. And they go in there, they just start swinging. It’s the craziest thing, they love it. Now, who wants that job? Do you want that job? Look, he’s a tough guy sitting here, you too, you’re tough guys, you don’t want any part of it. They’re just incredible and they love our country. They love our country. And then people say, ” Oh, they’re too rough. They’re too rough.” You have no idea how bad some of these gangs are and what they do. They use knives because it’s more painful. They cut people up. They cut two young, beautiful girls, 16 years old. They were going home from school and they cut them to pieces, killed them, they’re animals.

We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US armed forces in 75 years, space force. Not since the air force. Think of it, the air force was last. If I did just that, space force big deal, by the way, it’s going to end up being one of the most important things you’ve ever imagined. But if I just did that, a sixth branch of the US military, that would be a big deal. That’s like one of many, many things. We passed VA choice and VA accountability. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, they were after him for a year. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many others. Qasem Soleimani is gone.

I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, one of the great disasters. And by the way, it’s practically expired. The crazy deal that Obama made practically expired. And his chief negotiator, he never left. ” I want this.” “Nope. We’re not giving to you.” “Okay, let’s go on to the next one. Give me this.” “Nope.” “Give me this.” “Nope.” “Give me this.” “Nope.” He never won a point, he lost everything. It’s the worst deal I’ve ever seen. And the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm. And I promised everybody I would never go riding in a bicycle race. I swear to you. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.

I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. That was a 52 year development that I got done in about a day. They’d been negotiating that sovereignty over the Golan Heights, I got it done immediately. 52 years, they worked on that. But instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. It’s so great. Peace in the Middle East. So Biden’s put forward a platform that would end America as we know it. And this is true. I don’t think of him as a radical lefty, but basically he’s controlled by them. And what about this Kamala? How about her? She at 15%, no, she’s at 13%. Then people started … no she’s at 12. No, she’s at 10. She’s at nine, she’s at seven. These are a poll numbers. She got worse than worse. She quit before she ever got to Iowa.

Plus nobody, including Pocahontas, treated Biden so badly. Called him a racist, brought him into the me too movement, made him a member of the me too movement. The things she said. And I brilliantly said, “Well, the one person he can choose is Kamala.” “Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to pick Kamala,” and she’s rated more liberal than Bernie. You know what, he’s number two. Believe it or not. You know, it’s a true story. She is rated the most liberal person in Congress. And I think she’s grossly incompetent, I’ll be honest with you. I don’t think she knows what [ 01:22:50]. We have a great vice president, Mike Pence. He’s great and he says hello.

If elected, Biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions, people with preexisting conditions, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. They’re all going to come in. If you have that, the problem is we’re going to give you healthcare, they’re going to all pour into the United States and our country can’t afford it. We want to be nice, we all have hearts, country can’t afford it. They would get people that never even thought of coming if they see that. Can’t do it. They would end our travel bans on jihadist regions. We have very strong … remember I got travel bans. Everyone thought it was such a terrible thing, such a terrible person. He’s such a terrible person. I’m such a bad guy, I got travel bans. And increase refugee admissions by more than 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Ban school choice and all charter schools, they’re very important. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America.

A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. All Americans, race, color, creed, all Americans. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China, once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Pennsylvania. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We’d ban them. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. Thank you. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, stupid foreign wars. We losing our youth to countries that you’d never even heard of, right? Never even heard of them.

We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will surprise, think of the surprise medical billing, we’re going to end it, surprise. You ever walk into a hospital, oh, gee, fix you up. Oh, great. Then you get a bill for $2,000 for a band-aid. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I’ve already signed and brilliantly starts on January 1st. Hey, you better vote for me. You know, I think that’s, in a way, bigger than healthcare. Can you imagine Biden if he won? Price transparency is so big, it’s all done, it starts on January 1st. How smart is that? How smart. And you’re going to see numbers and reductions like you’ve never seen. Could you imagine if he were president, “Sir, our medical costs have dropped in half price. Transparency has been unbelievable.” “What is that? What is price transparency?” And they’ll explain it to him. He still won’t have a clue.

But can you imagine giving him credit? I signed it, it’s all done. It starts on January 1st. I say, “Why can’t you start it now, just in case?” And know what they said, “Sir, statutorily, it has to start then.” I said, “All right, let’s go.” But I know we’re going to win, so it’s not going to matter. And we’re going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We have a favored nations laws, well now we get the same price as all these nations that are paying a tiny fraction, which should have been instituted a long time ago. And the drug companies are going after me with those ads. Oh, it’s terrible, terrible. You know why? Just every time you see an add from the drug company, they got plenty of money, that’s why nobody ever fights them. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, just remember one thing, your drug prices are coming down. That’s what it means. That’s what it means.

We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients. We will protect every single patient. America will land, by the way, the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You know, NASA was an absolute disaster, grass was growing through the fairways too. They had fairways, that’s about all they use, were the fairways. And now we have something, right through the runways, the landing strips, it was all grass infested, it was all weed infested, and now it’s the number one space center in the world, by far. It was a closed up mess. And we have rich guys sending up rockets, Elon and others. They send up rockets and we say, let them keep going. Let them keep spending money on these rockets. They love rockets. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words in our national motto, in God, we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania, like nobody has ever stood up before. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote

And early voting, if you didn’t know it, has already begun and watch it and watch those fake ballots, you got to go out and turn them in. If you see somebody cheating, you got to turn them in, from Erie … and you probably will, it’s going to be a mess, watch this. But get out and vote early. From Erie to Eastern, from Altoona to Scranton, from Harrisburg to right here in Pittsburgh. Say hello to big Ben. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for their beloved country. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence, right? This is the state. Such history, such history. It’s where the army, weathered it’s brutal winter at Valley Forge, I know it well. Where George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. Gettysburg, one of the great, great, incredible sights of history, Gettysburg. So vicious, so horrible and yet so beautiful and so historic, right? Incredible. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater, greater, greater than ever before. Not even close, not even close, it’s what we’re doing, we’re doing it together. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.

We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you.",22/9/20
"Hello, Jacksonville. We love Jacksonville. We love Jacksonville. I’m thrilled to be back in my home state of Florida with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. This is some crowd. I just wish the cameras would show the crowd. They don’t want to do that. They don’t like to do that. It’s harder for us to win because we have a fake news back there, but somehow we just keep on doing it. Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it crazy? It’s interesting, when Biden comes to Florida, he’ll have 12, 13 people. You know they do the circles and he has a hard time filling up the circles. Here, we probably have 30,000 people or something. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people.

Well, I want to thank you. Forty days from now, we’re going to win Florida. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. And this is the most important election in the history of our country, I believe that. It is because we’re dealing with people that are crazy. They’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to take away your second amendment, you know that. Your second amendment is not going anywhere with me, I can tell you that. The Democrat party has been completely taken over by socialists, Marxists and far left extremists. They embrace the policies of Communist Cuba, Socialist Venezuela. They want to end the American dream for Hispanic-Americans. We love Hispanic-Americans well.

Did you see, they released a poll today? They said Trump’s doing really well. What’s going on with the Hispanic? It took you so long to figure out that I love you. How long did it take? No more of that stuff. No, the Hispanic-Americans are great. And they did, they released a poll today and nobody’s ever seen anything like it. The Republicans are beating the Democrats with Hispanic-Americans. No, we’re doing great. We’re doing great. And they never like to show those polls. Whenever you see, they don’t show too many polls, that’s only because we’re winning. We’re winning by a lot. We think we’re winning by a lot.

But the only poll that counts is on November 3rd, right? That’s the only poll that counts. So get out there, don’t let them bluff you. Whatever it is, get out there and vote. The Republican party is the party of job, safety and freedom and we will ensure that America never becomes a Socialist or Communist country. I’ve added that recently. I said, “Socialist country.” I said, “Now a Socialist or Communist country,” because these people are crazy. Kamala, Kamala is further left than Bernie. I didn’t know that. She is the furthest left in the U.S. Senate. She was up at 15% when she started, you know that right, that story? She went down to 14, then she went to 12, then she went to 11. She went to nine and eight, six, four, two, one and then she left before Iowa, the great state of Iowa, where I made ethanol possible for them, ethanol.

And I gave our farmers $28 billion, thank you very much, China. We took it out of China because they were targeting Iowa, Nebraska, a lot of our great States, Wisconsin. We gave our farmers a lot of money. Some came down to farmers down in Florida. They don’t know that. We’ve got a lot of farmers in Florida. But here’s the choice facing every Florida vote, Joe Biden will deliver a crippling shutdown. He’s actually thinking about… No, we did that and we saved millions of lives. That’s it? We’re doing good now. And by the way, your governor’s done a great job. Florida is down, low down with the China virus, it’s China virus. Some people call it coronavirus. That sounds like a beautiful place in Italy, right? No, it didn’t come from Italy. It came from China.

But this guy’s talking, he’ll shut it down. If the scientists say shut it down, he’ll shut it down. No, we’re not shutting anything down. We are doing so well. You look at our numbers. Wait until you see the third quarter. I shouldn’t say it because back there, but wait until you see how good the third quarter is going to be, and it comes out just before the election, so I’m taking a risk when I say it. You won’t believe the numbers you say. I tell you, you’re going to see numbers, nobody’s going to believe those numbers. We’re hearing from 25 to a 35% GDP. Nobody’s ever heard of that. Well, Iran has a 25% GDP too, but it’s a negative GDP of 25. They just announced negative 25.

They don’t like me too much. Be careful. Be careful. I’m delivering a safe vaccine and we’re doing a record recovery. This recovery is a record. They’ve never seen anything like it. And next year is going to be, I think, the best economic year in the history of our country, unless a very sleepy guy got in and he decided to quadruple everybody taxes. Then you can forget it. He’s a sleepy guy. Did you see he did a lid this morning? Again, lid, lid. You know what a lid is? A lid is when you put out word you’re not going to be campaigning today. So he does the lid all the time. I’m working my ass off. I’m in Texas. I’m in Ohio. I’m in North Carolina, South Carolina. I’m in Michigan. I’m all over the place, Wisconsin.
Thank you, thank you. But he puts a lid on. So a lid, I didn’t know what the hell I lid was. I’ve only been doing this for three and a half years. Right? But a lid is you’re not going to go out today. You’re going to stay in your apartment, or let’s put it this way, in his basement. So early in the morning, he’s put a lid on. That means nothing for the… I guess they do that for the press. The fake news goes home and they say how great he is as a candidate. They go home and they say, “He’s a great candidate,” but he put another lid, many lids. So he did a lid today, early in the morning, that he won’t be working today. And I don’t know, I’m working so hard. Maybe he’s right. Think of it. Supposing he never campaigns and he wins. You know how badly I’m going to feel? I’m working hard and you’ve got to work hard. And you know what? I said it today, we cannot have a low energy individual as our president. We can’t.

And he’s the lowest energy individual I’ve ever seen. I’ve ever seen. So we’ll see what happens, but he’s lidding up. Maybe he’s going to be great at the debate. He’s been doing it for 47 years. Somebody said, “Oh, he won’t do well at the debate.” I said, “I think you’re wrong. He’ll do fine. He’s going to do fine.” They’ll give him a big shot or something and he’ll go out there. He’ll have a lot of energy. He’ll have energy. He’ll be like Superman for about 15 minutes. Biden’s plan will crush Florida. My plan will crush the virus and we’re doing it. We’re rounding the third. We’re rounding the turn. Under my leadership, prosperity will surge. Normal life, oh I love normal life. We want to get back to normal life. We’ll fully resume. The Florida tourism and hospitality industries will reach record highs. That’s what’s going to happen, you see it. And next year will be one of the greatest years.

We are going to have… I’m telling you, mark it down and if I’m wrong, you’ll say I was wrong. I’ll say, “Sorry about that.” But we’re going to have a great year. We’re going to have a great everything. Our country is doing great. Our military has never been stronger. We’ve taken out so many bad ones. Hopefully it’s so strong that we’ll never have to use it. You understand that? You’ll want to make it so strong. We’ve never had weapons like this. No country in the world ever possessed the power, the weaponry. What we have is so incredible. Nobody’s ever possessed it before, not Russia, not China, not anybody. We’re the envy of the world.

Russia, not China, not anybody, we’re the envy of the world. Hope to God, we never have to use them. That’s all I can tell you. This election is about jobs. By the way, speaking of jobs, it’s all made in the USA everything we have.

This election is also about law and order. You know, they said, “Oh, don’t say law and order. That’s too tough a term.” They say, “Sir, say law and order very lightly.” Then say, ” And safety and liberty and this.” I said, “No, no, it’s about law and order.” We have to have law and order, right?

These Democrat run states are a disaster. They’re a disaster. You look at what’s happening all over the country and many of them, look at Portland. How bad is that? I mean, how bad is that? I will say last night in Kentucky, I spoke to the governor. He’s a Democrat. We had a great talk and he pulled out his national guard, and he’s doing it good. I gave him credit. I give him credit, but mostly they don’t want to do that. I say, “Let us send the national guard.” I did it in, you remember? Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota.

So, I did it in Minneapolis. Minnesota, they were having a hard time. It took a little long, a little longer than we wanted, but we got the okay to get in. We solved that problem in about 25 minutes, I think it took. They formed a line. That was the hard part. The easy part was just walking straight ahead. They never flinched. They were not socially distanced. They were right next to each other. They had $250,000 piece uniforms. They had more stuff in their head.

I’m trying to figure out what is it. They had computers. They had infrared goggles. They had everything. They walk forward with their canisters of tear gas and pepper spray. It was, remembered the CNN reporter? He went down. He got hit on the knee with a can of, what? Yeah, that’s right, he got hit. He said, “I’m down. I’m down.” He was down. Still bad. I felt badly for him though. He went down, Ali Velshi. Remember, he was standing and he was saying, “This is a friendly protest. It’s wonderful to see the lovely people that are here.” He’s ducking and behind him, the entire city was burning down. Do you remember that? The entire city. Why are they doing that? What’s the purpose of it? I don’t get it. I don’t get it. But no, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas. They say it hurts, hurts.
That’s only going 52 miles an hour. A bullet goes about 2,000 miles an hour, but they say it hurts. But they cleaned out that city in half an hour. They had no problem. Minneapolis, that’s one of the reasons I’m going to win. Another reason would be Ilhan Omar. That’s a reason. Omar, we’re going to win because of Omar. That’s a beauty. That’s really, she’s great. She’s great. She loves our country very much. She has a total disrespect for our country, and I think she has hatred for our country, but I would say Omar is a big reason that we’re going to win. They’re not too fond of her in Minnesota. I’ll always fight for the right of all citizens to live in security and peace, so we have law and order.

Joe Biden is weak as hell. He surrendered his party to flag burners, riders and anti- police radicals, the Democrat party’s war on police. A lot of people say cops, I never liked the word. My father, sit down, please. Come on, won’t be here for awhile. What the hell. We have nothing else to do. I have nothing else to do except run a country. The hardest part about running the country is dealing with crazy Democrats. We’re working on stimulus for people, because it’s not their fault. It was China’s fault that we can’t get Nancy Pelosi to approve it. She wants to wait until after the election. I said, “People want their money now. Not going to have any impact from that standpoint, people want their money now.”

The Democrat party’s war on cops is putting the lives of innocent police officers in danger, but my father had great respect, always had great respect for law enforcement, for the police. One time, I said, “Dad, the cops are out there. Look at that, they look great.” He says, “Never use the word cops. It’s police.” That’s the kind of respect he had. He thought, I don’t want to, you know? Right. Look, I have this couple of pretty rough looking guy. No, it’s true. So, I always find it a little hard.

I just left an impression, this police. He thought it was slang. I don’t think they mind. I don’t think … How many? We got a lot of them here. Does anybody mind the term cops? Who’s here that’s a police man or woman, policeman? Do they mind? A lot of them. A lot of them. Do they mind that term cops? No. They just want respect and they just want to be allowed to do their job properly as nobody can do it. You agree with that? That’s what I say. All right. Now start calling them cops. Respect us and let us do our job.

Earlier this month, two sheriff’s deputies were ambushed at close range in Los Angeles, California. I called them both and they’re okay, but they were hit. They were hit bad. Last night, as you know, two police officers were shot in Louisville, Kentucky. Every year, dozens of courageous police officers lay down their lives for people that they never met, people that they don’t know, people they never saw in most cases, right? They laid down their lives for people they never met. They’re incredible. Law enforcement, let’s give them a hand, please.
Thank you very much. That’s good. I tell them all the time, we have endorsements from all of them, but I tell them all the time, you have no idea how much you’re loved. They don’t hear it because they watch the fake news at night, and you don’t get the truth. So, that’s a lot of people back there. That’s a lot of fakers back. Look at all those red lights. The red light means you’re on live. The problem with being on live, you make a little bit of a mistake and they say, “This was a horrible evening.”

Hear our voice! Hear our voice! Hear our voice! Hear our voice! Hear our voice! Hear our voice! USA! USA! USA! USA!

All right. Thank you. That’s enough. That’s enough of it. No, it’s very dishonest. It’s a shame. Really does hurt our country. It’s so fake. They don’t show the protesters. They don’t show it. When you think that like cities are burning down and storefronts are being exploded, people are being killed, they would have you believe there’s nothing happening. It’s the most incredible thing. I don’t even understand why. No matter what your philosophy is, no matter where you stand, why wouldn’t you want to show the facts, show what’s happening? Then we fix it.

The Republican cities don’t have trouble. The Republican states, they don’t have trouble. You go to different states, they don’t know … They find it, some of these governors, friends of mine, and I have friends on both sides, but Republican governors, red states, they look like, how is a thing like this possible? Because they have law and order. They have law and order for this. That’s what it is.

For the entire summer, Joe Biden was silent as his far left supporters assaulted police officers, harassed innocent Americans and set fire to buildings. There were rioters. There were looters. They were anarchists. He called them peaceful protesters. He said they’re peaceful protesters. Joe, they’re not peaceful. Now, maybe he may believe it. I mean, honestly, they may say they’re peaceful. Okay, I’ll say they’re peace. I think he believes it. I actually do. It’s the other ones that you have to worry about, because they call the shots, not him. He’s called for the ridiculous cutting of police funding, abolishing cash bail, if you can believe that and the closing of our prisons. They want to close up prisons. That’s a good idea. He even described law enforcement as the enemy. He said law enforcement is the enemy. Now, I assume, I’ll ask the fake news. Has he taken it back? I assume, because he’s taken everything back. He’s taken anti-fracking back. He’s taken pretty much everything back, but remember, it’s the first thing they say that’s what they stick with. Biden’s anti-police crusade must stop. As president, I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement, that’s why we’re here.

I was honored to receive the endorsement of 48 sheriffs right here in Florida three weeks ago, and all over the country, law enforcement from Texas, Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York’s finest endorsed me. They’ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The National Troopers Coalition. Chicago, how about that? Chicago police, they endorsed me, Chicago. All the major law enforcement organizations all across our country.
They go back home to mommy. Mommy, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You know the incredible thing about that? I didn’t hear anything except our crowd. No, they have no voice. They’re screaming at the top of their lungs, but their lungs are very small, and I didn’t hear, all of a sudden, you hear wah like this right here. That’s true. People, if you wouldn’t recognize them, we wouldn’t even know they’re here. Now tomorrow, the headline is, so you have one young protester, the headline will be tomorrow, Trump’s rally broken up by protests. One very young girl, she’s a girl …. girl, she looks like she’s like about … years old. How the hell has that happened? 200 generals and … leaders, also hundreds of … spouses … given their complete and total endorsement … to uphold our land and to uphold our …. as written on Saturday … announcing my nominee to the … States Supreme Court.

It’s true. It’s going to be a big deal. We’re doing it at the White House, the Rose garden of the White House unless it’s raining. In which case, we’ll still do it there. That’s okay. It’s beautiful, the White House. So beautiful. We love the White House, right outside the Oval Office. They don’t want us to do it. The Democrats say, “You shouldn’t do it.” Why? We have a lot of time. Let me ask you the one simple question. If it was them, instead of us, do you think they do it? I think so. No, this will be a very talented person. It will be a woman. I’m sorry, man. It will be a woman. All right. Ready?

Who wouldn’t rather see a man? Oh, that’s trouble. Try it again. Who would rather see a man? That’s not good. Who would rather see a woman? I think it would be, really, I think it would take tremendous courage. I don’t care how great the man is. Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to tell you that Jim Fitzgerald, and then you would see a lot of very unhappy faces. Right? My opponent refuses to release his lists of potential justices because they will be handpicked by extremists like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sometimes known as AOC plus three, right? AOC. One of the three I think is Omar, right? But they’ll pick her first.

So, if Biden does that, if he puts an extremist in to that position, he loses everything that’s like normal. If he does the other way, he loses the left. So, he doesn’t want to give a left. I’d love to have him put up a list. I’d like to see what that, I could see what that list would be. I could already tell you the people on that list. It would not be good. It would not be pretty. You would not be happy. That would be the end. If given power, Biden and his supporters would pack the court. They’re talking about pack into court, because we have one race. We have one. I’ll tell you what. So this will be my third and we’re in great shape. You see what’s going on with the Republican party, how unified the Republican party is? Right. Now we’re unified. It’s a beautiful thing to say. Thank you, Mitt. Thank you. Appreciate it. Even Mitt’s on board. Even Mitt’s on board.

No, it’s a good thing to see having a unified part. Of course, when they did the impeachment hoax, we had 197 to nothing in the house and 52 and a half to a half. That was Mitt, but that’s okay. I’m no longer angry at Mitt, because he’s being very nice on the Supreme Court. He’s doing the right thing. I just want him to do the right thing, but they want to pack the court. You know what that means? They want to put on a lot of justices. These are things that are just horrible. I guess we could do that too. Right? We could do that too. But remember, it was Harry Reid that made this all possible. They’re angry at us. Listen, Chuck, Crying Chuck, you know who Crying Chuck is? Chuck.

Every time you complain, remember it was Harry Reid, your person in charge. He had your job before. It was Harry Reid who made this all possible. Thank you very much, Harry. I hope you’re enjoying your evening. No, they blame us. Harry Reid gave us the power, nuclear … very much, but he wants to pack the Supreme Court with radicals who will terminate the second amendment, confiscate your firearms, eliminate the right to self defense, strike under God from the pledge of allegiance and all other places, tear down crosses from public spaces and force taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion.

These far left … violent criminals, shield foreign terrorist, impose sanctuary cities and declare the death penalty totally unconstitution. Hey, it will be totally unconstitutional. They wanted to declare it unconstitutional for even the most depraved mass murderers. And it’s a tough thing. It’s a tough thing. They came to my office today and the death penalty for clemency. I said, “What was the crime?” The crime was so horrible that I won’t tell you what it was, but it’s been going on for 21 years or so. The crime was so horrible that this person committed, that I said, “Look, I just can’t talk about it.” It was so horrible. That’s usually the case, usually the case like the Boston bomber.

By the way, they want to give votes to prisoners, people in prison. They want to give votes. So we immediately said, remember Bernie? Crazy Bernie. Bernie is, I’ll tell you one thing about him. He’s the greatest loser I’ve ever seen. No, true. No, I mean that in a respectful way, because what they did to him with Hillary was bad, but this time was even worse. Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren would have left the campaign one day before super Tuesday, Bernie with her ideology basically, because she’s a radical left and she was really fresh to him, but she was really fresh. How bad was Elizabeth Warren to Joe Biden? There’s only one person that was worse.

Who was worse? Kamala. I said he’ll never, this shows you my great instinct, my great knowledge of politics. I said, “He will never pick Kamala because no human being has been treated worse than anybody than Kamala.” Remember, she called him a racist. She called him xenophobic. She called him all sorts of things. She called him things that were so bad, I can say them. I can’t say them, but she called him a lot of things. I said, “Well, she’s out.” Then he picks her. She picks her. You always pick people going up, not going down in the polls. If I were get to pick, and by the way, how good is Mike Pence? Is he great? Okay.

He’s a rock. He’s a solid guy and he’s a great guy and a great vice president. He worked so hard. He’s all over the place. He’s in Michigan. He’s everywhere. Where you go today, Mike? I went to Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina. I went to Wisconsin and the guy, I’ll tell you what, he’s an incredible guy and he’s a great guy. He loves the people of this country. He loves our country. You cannot do better than Mike Pence. You know that.

If you want to save America, you must get out and vote. In just three and a half years, we’ve secured our borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, obliterated ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals and they were a disaster. I read some of them. I said, “Who agrees to this stuff?” Stupid people agree to it, and brought jobs back home to America. We brought them back. You had the greatest year you’ve ever had last year, the greatest year you’ve ever had. Under 16 years of presidents, Obama and Bush, household income rose only $2,945. Okay. That’s over a course of 16 years, close to 3,000, right? In three years and including energy because look at the saving. How are you doing at the gas pump? Not so bad, right? Did you ever see that? You ever think that was going to happen? In three years, so that was less than 3,000 over 16, in-

So that was less than 3,000 over 16. In three years, you went up $10,000, including energy. We lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the first three years of any president in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Not only here, anywhere. We were beating everybody.

For years, I heard that China in 2019, was going to overtake us, right? That didn’t happen. Then they released the plague, but that didn’t happen. And it still’s not happening with the plague, because they got hit hard themselves. I wonder if they understood that they were going to get hit too. But the plague came here, they could have stopped it. They could have stopped it from going all over the world. 188 countries all over the world, including Europe and the United States.

We’ve added a record 10.6 million jobs in the last four months, including 3.3 million jobs for Hispanic Americans. That’s a record.

When the plague arrived from China. We launched the largest national mobilization since World War Two. We pioneered life saving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April, you see what’s happened. Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. And now you see they’re being hit very hard. The fake news was saying, “Well, I don’t know if you’ve done as well as Europe.” I said, “We did better than Europe.” And now Europe is exploding again, unfortunately, I don’t want that to happen, but they don’t want to talk about that because that’s not good for their narrative.

Our early and aggressive action saved many millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed, we developed and distribute a vaccine. We will have a vaccine so soon you won’t even believe it. Although they’re trying to do a little bit of a political hit today, just a little bit, you notice that? Let’s delay the vaccine just a little bit. But we have three great companies and then others also. Johnson & Johnson, right? Pfizer, Moderna, great companies, all of them, great companies. And they’re right there. They’re way advanced, way advanced, they’re in the final steps.

I took historic action to get critical relief for American workers. Through our paycheck protection program, we save 3.2 million Florida jobs.

We’re launching a historic effort to bring our medical supply chains back home, where they belong. In 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Rico’s thriving pharmaceutical industry. I am reversing that and we’re going back so that Puerto Rico can get its pharmaceutical industry back, and they’re going to have it back soon. That was Joe Biden that did that. And then they’ll vote because automatic, they vote for a Democrat. What’s the purpose? He’s the one that did it. He’s the one. Look what he did, how devastated, look at what he did to our African-American community. And people don’t want to talk about it. But what he did was devastating. Devastating. He’s not good for anyone, let’s face it.

Last week, I also announced an additional $13 billion that goes to disaster relief for Puerto Rico. They got hit hard. I hope they remember that. That was given by Trump, not by the Democrats. Our hearts are also with the communities in the Panhandle. I love the Panhandle. Ron will tell you. I’ll tell you. You’re a great governor and he’s doing a great job. He called up, he said the Panhandle’s hit, sir. They love you in the Pan-, I think I’m at about 99. 9% in the Panhandle. But we took care of the Panhandle, you remember Hurricane Sally? That was not good, but we took care of it. Ron came into my office, he’d say, “Sir, we need more money.” I said, “How much?” He gave me a number you don’t even want to believe. I said, “You got it, Ron. Don’t come back, Ron.” He comes back about three days later, “Sir, we need more money.” But that’s I guess, a good governor. That’s what a good governor does, right? That’s what a good governor does. I approved a major disaster declaration for the State of Florida last night. And we will be with you every step of the way, every step, we’re there so fast. We sometimes, other presidents took long time to approve them. I approve them before the storms hit shore, because we know what’s going to happen. We took care of Florida.

On November 3rd, Florida will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recovery, delay the vaccine, impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, which he wants to do, destroy the suburbs. He’s going to destroy the suburbs. Give free healthcare to illegal aliens, which means millions and millions of people are going to pour into our country and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in their class, in their school room.

To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced something last week that was very popular. That we’re launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We’ll teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the Earth. And you haven’t seen anything yet. You see what we’re doing. I’ve also issued an executive order to prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in the federal government.

That hateful Marxist doctrine paints America as a wicked nation, seeks to divide everyone by race, rewrites American history, and teaches people to be ashamed of themselves and be ashamed of their country. That’s not happening anymore. We fired so many of these wise guys. We had one getting $350,000 a year teaching our military this stuff. And he said, “What happened?” We said, “You’re fired. Get out.” Many people.

No, it’s become a cancer. It’s like a cancer, but many, many people gone. They’re all gone. And if they’re not, let us know and we’ll let them go. But we have to unite together as one proud American family. That’s what we are. We’re joined tonight by some incredible warriors, some incredible people. One of them that I’m most proud of is a man that came to this state and what a job he’s done. Your great governor, Ron DeSantis. He’s doing a great job. Ron is doing a great job. Ron, how are we doing on the election? How are we doing on November 3rd, Ron? He says, good. We better do good. He won a great primary, then he beat a man that they said had a good future. I’m not thinking his future is looking to good. How’s his future. I don’t think it’s to good right now. Ron was great, tough and strong, and he didn’t choke under pressure. That’s for sure. But much more important than Ron is the First Lady of Florida, Casey DeSantis.

The Mayor of Jacksonville, a really good guy. I got him to really, he wanted to do it so bad. We wanted to have our Republican National Convention right here in Jacksonville. But the timing was a little bit bad. We got hit a little bit with COVID, as they say, we got hit a little bit with the China virus, but I’ll tell you what, Lenny Curry was absolutely fantastic. Your mayor, Lenny Curry.

All right. You ready? Some of the greatest, toughest warriors you’ll ever meet. During the impeachment hoax, they said, this is the biggest pile of crap you’ve ever seen. I’m the only guy in history that got impeached for an absolutely perfect conversation. It was perfect. We sent it around. Everyone said, “What’s wrong with this? We sent it to the Justice Department, please check this. Thank goodness we had people that were taking it down, right? Exact notes, great patriots. They took it down, two of them, and it was perfect. We sent it to the Justice Department. Please examine this conversation. We’d like to know what you think. They called back, they said, “Okay, listen, what exactly are you looking for here?” These guys are used to looking at killings and drug dealers and they’re saying, “Explain to us, what are you looking for? We don’t see it.” This was the greatest hoax.

And today, by the way, you see what happened. They caught him. They’ve got him cold. They got him cold. We’ll talk about it in a sec. They caught him. They now find out that Trump was a hundred percent truthful. It was a hoax. They got him cold, it was just announced. Dan Scavino just said, “It’s the biggest, it’s the hottest thing on the internet.” They got him cold. We’ll talk about it in a second. But these are warriors. When I needed warriors, I had Representative Matt Gaetz. Where is he?

Matt, what a great guy. What a guy. Big future. Thank you, Matt. What a warrior. Thank you. He’s very shy on television, right? I noticed. He’s great. Thank you, Matt. Ted Yoho. Ted, where’s Ted? Great job.

Now, a man that is in charge of all spying. He was so good that Matt and Ron and Ted and Mike Waltz, and a lot of people came to see me. Mike, another great one. Thank you, Mike. Is John Rutherford here? Good job, John. Thank you for the help. Thank you, John. But Mike Waltz has been so great and candidate for Congress, Kat Cammack. Kat. So Kat was in the Oval Office yesterday, right? And I said, “How you doing?” “Sir, I’m up 42.” I said, “42 what?” 42 points. That was a big Trump district, right? You’re not in any real trouble. That’s for sure. She’s got it. That was a great win you had, she’ll be with us a long time, a long time. I really appreciate it.

And we also have some others that are running for different offices in the Republican Party. And we love the Republican Party. They have been incredible. They have been incredible. We also have some of our really unbelievable, undercover operatives. And if you don’t mind, I won’t introduce them. All right? I don’t think we’re going to introduce them. I want to so badly. I want to have them stand up and bring them up here. I want to hug him and kiss him, which I’m not allowed to do because of social distancing. But somehow they’ve may lose some effectiveness if I introduce them. So they’re in the crowd. I saw two of them and I won’t bother, but they are great, great champions of our country.
 
And also here is a woman who was so, I mean, she was tough. She was in charge of a great state, Michigan. As you kept asking me, “Come back, you’re going to win.” Everyone said Republicans hadn’t won Michigan in many decades. And I felt I should because I was bringing back and I was doing so much for the business and jobs and bringing people back and recommending and telling them, you’re losing your business to Mexico, Canada. And they gave me, 12 years ago, they gave me the man of the year in Michigan. And I made this crazy speech that I said, “You’re losing all your jobs to Mexico.” And all of a sudden I’m running for office and a woman who handled it was unbelievable. She’d say to me, “Sir, would you please come and make a speech?” I said, “Who are you?” “My name is Ronna McDaniel. I’m in charge of Michigan.” Where’s Ronna?

She said, “My name is Ronna McDaniel. I’m a charge of Michigan.” I said, “I hear we don’t have a chance.” We should win Michigan. But I hear, “You’re going to win it if you come here.” So I went and made a speech. Then I went and made another speech. Then she’d call again and again, I couldn’t take it. And then I said, “Look, I’ll do one more.” She wanted me to do one more. She said, “I’m telling you, you’re going to win. Do one more.” This is two weeks left. And I said, “All right, this is it, though, this is it.” I’ve devoted a lot of time to Michigan. And everyone says you can’t win. By the way, just got a poll, we’re three points up in Michigan.

She said, “Sir,” then she used to call me Mr. Trump, I wasn’t president yet. She said, “Sir, please, just this one time, this is it, three weeks out.” I said, “All right, this is it. Can’t do anymore. I’ve got to go to a lot of states. That’s it.” “This is it, sir, I promise.” So I did it. Then the night before the election, she said, “Sir, you’re going to win Michigan, but you got to make one more stop.” I said, “You got to be-”

And I made it on election day. I arrived at 1215 in the now morning. That was now election day, right? I started speaking at one o’clock in the morning on election day. My wife said, “Are you crazy?” We had 32,000 people. And the reason I went, she wanted us there. But we found out that crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Hussein Obama, and Mrs. Obama and Bill Clinton were traveling to Michigan unexpectedly because as Bill Clinton told them three months ago, “You’re going to have trouble with Trump and Michigan.” They don’t want to listen to him. they said, ‘Oh, well,” because he’s a natural politician. And he said, “You’re going to have trouble in Wisconsin too, and be careful of Minnesota.” This was Clinton. Remember they were laughing, they thought he was very funny. But they knew they were in trouble. So they flew there. They had 500 people. I went there. I start speaking at one in the morning with 32,000 people in Grand Rapids, Grand Rapids.

In Grand Rapids. And I said, it’s like this. I said, “We’re not going to lose this state.” You can’t lose. When you have a crowd, you can’t lose. You can look at a crowd, I can look at this crowd. I can say, “Look at it.” As far as the eye can see, as far as the eye can see. I’d leave here, I said, “We’re not losing Florida.” I can tell you that, you could tell, you can feel it. You can feel it. You have an instinct. We’re joined as well by a group of incredible supporters who have recently walked away from the Democrat Party. They walked away from the Democrats. They just registered as Republicans. Thank you. Thank you. And they’re going to be voting for us. It’s just a whole big group of people. And I thank you. And you’re all over the place. Thank you, thank you. They know. It’s called, they’re smart and they have common sense.

We’ve spent the last four years reversing the terrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Together, we’ve taken on a corrupt and broken system that’s been throwing everything at us from the very beginning. And remember this and I say it all the time. I’ve done more in 47 months than Joe Biden’s done in 47 years. But today a trove of text messages was released from the FBI agents involved in the Russia witch hunt. You had to see this. This is what I was talking about before. The headline from the Federalist reads, Trump was right, explosive new FBI texts detail internal furor over handling of the crossfire hurricane investigation. That was the name. We caught him. We had him before this, but this is like, remember the insurance policy, darling, darling. Oh, I love you so much, darling. She’s going to win, isn’t she? Yes. 100 million to one. That’s not good odds for me. They might not have been great, but they were a lot better than that. 100 million to one, Lisa, I love you so much. But if for some reason she doesn’t win, we have an insurance policy, that’s what we’ve been living through, their insurance policy. You can’t be any more obvious than that.

These people are scum. They were trying to do a coup, who would think? And we caught them. Before that, we caught them spying on our nation and they’ve gotten caught. Let’s see what happens with them now. But this was a big day. This was a big day. Never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you, there’s a lot of truth to that.

For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA. Joe Biden championed every globalist betrayal of America for 47 years. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made, emptied out your factories. And he was a cheerleader for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of American jobs. And I proudly signed a historic executive order, making it official government policy to buy American and hire American.

By the way, you ever seen this guy? He’s using my slogan. He’s using my slogans. I saw him the other day. It’s like, buy American. I said, “I’ve been saying that for five years,” right? He’s using my, he has no clue, I’m telling you. You got to come up with your own slogans.

… I’m telling you. You’ve got to come up with your own slogans, Joe. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military and launched the first new branch of U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years after the Air Force, the Space Force. Right here. We passed VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought that could happen. We have a 91% approval rating of the VA. 91% approval rating, highest in history, highest ever. Do you ever see, I don’t want to say this to them because they’ll find the vets, is there an unhappy vet some place? 91% approval. Remember, we used to always watch every night, you’d see things on the news about how badly the vets are treated. Now we have a 91% approval rating. My guys are doing a great job. And today, I can announce that the VA is approving a new $46 million lease for a brand new Veterans Healthcare Clinic in North Jacksonville.

We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist. All over the world, number one. The mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani is dead. Took him out. He deserved to be taken out. We withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. $150 billion, do you know what he got for it? Nothing. 1.8 billion in cash. He got nothing, nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. You saw what is happening there. In fact, I was nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes last week. You know the story. You know the story.

And I told our great First Lady, I said, “First Lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. I’m going to come home early. I’m going to watch it on NBC News,” which is one of the biggest scam jobs I’ve ever seen. NBC probably worse than CNN, NBC. “But we’re going to watch it. We’re going to watch the evening news. So we’ll watch the second place NBC.” You know it is. It’s second place. They spent all this money on PR and then I hit them hard. But they are bad. I said, “First Lady, wait till you see it. Nobel Peace Prize. This will definitely be the biggest thing.” All right, ladies and gentlemen, NBC News, they start off with you. They said you got some heavy rain. They started off with something else, something else, something else, something else. Now the show’s almost over. I said, “First Lady, they’re not mentioning the Nobel Peace prize. This is very embarrassing.” But then it was okay because two days later, I got nominated again. That was for Israel. I got nominated again.

Remember when Obama got it, they said, “Ladies and gentlemen, Barack Hussein Obama has just been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.” So what happened? I said, “First Lady, I just got nominated again. This time for Kosovo-Serbia. They’re not killing each other anymore. I stopped it. It’s totally different.” The first was Israel, Bahrain, UAE. This one was close to a totally different one. I don’t know if that’s ever happened before. I said, “First Lady, let’s give it another shot.” We watched the news, never even mentioned it. When Barack Obama got his Nobel Prize immediately after he got elected, they asked him, “Why did you get it?” He had no clue. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. And it was a big story. Breaking news. “We have breaking news.” They didn’t have breaking news when I got it, but that’s why we understand the press. We understand them very well. They’re fake.

The last administration made a pathetic one-sided deal with a Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. I stand with the proud people of Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. And you’re going to win that very soon. You’re going to win that very soon. The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama-Biden-Santos deal with Colombian drug cartels. They surrendered the narco terrorists. They surrendered to them and they caused illicit drug production to soar. Under my administration, we worked with our Colombian partners to launch a historic rival operation against the drug traffickers. And since April, we have seized or disrupted 227 metric tons of poisonous narcotics. Nobody has ever done anything like it.

Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered for the rise of China as a positive development for our country. I don’t think so. That was a disaster. Now Biden is put forward the most dangerous and extreme platform of any major party nominee in history. The band news is he doesn’t even know what the hell it is. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. It will drain your Medicare by giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants that will come over to this country by the millions when they see this. End virtually all immigration enforcement and oppose totally open borders. He would terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. Remember, I got that approved. They kept saying, “Oh, he lost. He lost. He lost.” And then I won in the Supreme Court. We have a travel ban. Guess what?

And increase refugee admissions by over 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. He wants to ban school choice and ban charter schools, which are absolutely imperative for our children. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep out of America, of our great country, we will stay away from those ridiculous, endless, foreign wars. They never end. Endless foreign wars. They’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. And nobody has strength like we have strength. Peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. They’re going to becoming down by 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% favored. Favored Nations. Favorite Nations Clause, we’ll be paying as low as anybody in the world. It’s called Favored Nations. Nobody had the guts to do it. And they are spending a lot of money on ads against me right now, that Big Pharma. They are spending a lot of money. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars.
I had such a nice life before doing this. But no administration has ever done in the first three and a half years, not even close, what we’ve done, and that’s very gratifying, I want to tell you that. And thank you very much. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.
And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote. We have to win this election. Most important election we’ve ever had. Early voting has already begun. Don’t wait, vote. It’s safe. Go out and vote. I hear we’re doing very well, by the way. That’s what the word is. We’ll see. We’ll see. But I hear we’re doing very well. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Orlando to Miami, from Pensacola to right here in Jacksonville, we stand on the shoulders of Florida patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and from here, in this beautiful, beautiful state, this sun drenched state of Florida, we launched American astronauts to the moon, we made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. You watch. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your health, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.

Thank you, Florida. Thank you, Florida.",24/9/20
"I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know about Herschel. I’d watch him in college, I’d watch him carry that ball, but I think he’d do just as well as a senator or a governor. We’re going to have to start talking to him about that. He’s a fantastic person, great man. I’m honored to be back in the heart of Georgia with the truly incredible organization, Black Voices for Trump. And we appreciate it.
 In 39 days, we’re going to win four more years in the White House. And we will do it with a record number of votes from the Black community, we have no doubt. That’s all happening. That’s all happening. We’re getting a lot of the people back there, they’re saying, “What’s going on over here?” They’re not happy about it, but that’s okay. Our movement is welcoming millions of Black Americans back to the Republican party, the party of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. Right? When I ran for president four years ago, I looked at the dismal and shameful record of the Democrat party. And as Black Americans, what the hell do you have to lose? Right? And they all said, “You shouldn’t use the word hell.” But I said, “It’s just, it’s more descriptive. Doesn’t work as well without it.”

Today, I want to share what you have to gain from voting Republican on November 3rd. It’ll be the biggest election of our lives. For decades, Democrat politicians like Joe Biden have taken Black voters for granted. They made you big promises before every election. And then the moment they got to Washington, they abandoned you and they sold you out. The Democrat party used you and they lied to you every single time. You know it better than anybody else knows it. The Democrats will always take back the vote. What they want to do is they’ll take that vote back, they want to take the Black voter for granted, and they have taken the Black voter for granted. And it’s not fair, it’s not right, and it’s not going to happen because we’re going to have such a victory like you’ve never had before.

Thank you. Thank you. In 2016, I made you a solemn pledge that whether you voted for me or not, I would be your greatest champion. Since that time, I’ve delivered even more than I promised. It’s one of those things. Few politicians do that. But I believe we have. Before the China virus, we built the greatest economy for African-Americans in the history of our country. And we are doing it again. In the first three years, we achieved the lowest Black unemployment rate in history. The Black youth unemployment rate reached an all time low. We achieved the largest job gains for African-Americans on record. Black Americans saw the largest increase in home ownership. The poverty rate for African-Americans reached the lowest level ever recorded. And last year, 811,000 African-Americans were lifted out of poverty, the most in over 51 years. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country.

I did more for the Black community in 47 months … I saw they used that line, so I don’t want to ruin it by saying it a second time. It was in the video, but I will say it again. Than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And I’m here today to announce a brand new plan to deliver more opportunity, more security, more fairness, and more prosperity to Black communities. We call it the Platinum Plan. Platinum Plan. And that’s a contract with Black Americans, and it’s going to be something that people talk about for a long time to come. If you vote Republican over the next four years, we will create three million new jobs for the Black community, open 500,000 new Black owned businesses, increase access to capital in Black communities by $500 billion. This includes investing in community development, financial institutions, and minority depository institutions. Build up peaceful and safer urban neighborhoods with the highest standards of, and you know this, of policing. We want the highest standards. We have to have highest standards of policing. Bring even greater fairness to the justice system. We did criminal justice reform. We remember that. Even greater.

We will create a national clemency project to right wrongful prosecutions and to pardon individuals who have reformed their life. You saw Alice, right? We love Alice. She had another 24 years to go. Can you believe it? She served 22 years, she had another 24 years to go. It was ridiculous. And she’s a great woman. Create a ladder of opportunity for African-American children by delivering school choice to every parent in America. So important. Give Black churches the ability to compete for federal resources for their communities. Bring better and tailored healthcare to address the historic disparities that we’ve had for so many years. You know that. This includes investing in treatments for kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, sickle cell disease, and maternal mortality. Advanced home ownership and wealth building in the Black community. Bring more manufacturing back to the USA, which we’re doing anyway. And back to the inner cities, which have been largely forgotten, although not so much in the last three years when you get right down to it.

Thank you. End Democrat policies that import low wage foreign workers from overseas to replace Black workers in our inner cities. Joe Biden cares more about the citizens of foreign countries than he does about Black Americans living in our own country. I will always put Americans first. And that includes, very, very importantly, Black Americans. And there’s much more in our plan, which we’re releasing today. So we’ll get everyone a copy, and it’s actually been very well received. And we appreciate that. The Platinum Plan is a bold vision that we can and really will achieve over the next four years that we’ll be able to do it. If not sooner. Unlike my opponent, I’m not a career politician, thank goodness. I get results and I keep my promise. And you’ve seen that. You’ve seen that.

Together, we will not only build up America’s Black communities, we’ll help with your vote with the Platinum Plan. We’ll lift up all forgotten communities, and we’ll strengthen our entire nation. And we are going to have an incredible four years. But more importantly, we’re going to have an incredible 40 years. We’re going to have many, many great years because we’re setting a foundation for the future. So when I’m not here, you’re going to be here forever. Especially look at these young people over here. You’re going to really be there for a long time. But we want this for long term. This year, the Republican party has 26 Black Republicans running for Congress. Where are they? Are they here? Are they here? A lot of them are here, right? Whoa. That’s a good looking group of people. And you’re doing well just about in every instance. Well, we’re going to help you to do even better. We’ll be helping you, you watch. And we’re thrilled to be joined today by eight of them. Raise your hand. Which are the eight? Oh, that’s so great. Yeah. They have what it takes. That’s fantastic. Great job.

One of them I’ve endorsed very strongly. I saw an ad that I liked. I said, “I thought it was great.” Raise your hand please. They’ve been now endorsed, I will tell you. And congratulations, by the way. It’s going to be a fantastic night, November 3rd. Now, I don’t know. With this ballot situation, you’re not going to see it November 3rd. The Democrats are playing games. You see they found ballots in a wastepaper basket? They found ballots dumped in a stream. Take a look at Iowa, the primaries. You remember the primary? They went to Iowa. We love Iowa, but they tried this ballot concept and they still don’t know who won. That was a long time ago. That was in that primary, the first primary. And it’s a very terrible thing that’s happening. Very, very terrible thing.

But you’re going to be raising the hand, if not November 3rd, hopefully shortly thereafter. And I know you’re going to be raising your hand with me. We may end up in a dispute for a long time because that’s the way they want it, but we’re going to end up winning. That’s for sure. Okay? We’re going to end up winning.

When I give my State of the Union address next year, I look forward to welcoming a historic number of Black Republican members of Congress. And we’re going to take back the House. We’re going to take back the House. We’ve already won some seats back. They don’t like to talk about that. The fake news, you’ll find out about the fake news. Have you figured out the fake news yet? You’re young and handsome and beautiful. Have you figured out the fake news yet? You’ll learn. You’ll learn. You’ll learn to live with it. You’ll learn to do what you have to do. But we are going to take back the House. I think we’re only 17 short now. We picked up a couple.

We just won a big one in Los Angeles we haven’t won in 22 years, California. Won a big one in Wisconsin, it was a great one. We won some really good ones. So we’re inching up. And you watch what’s going to happen. It’s going to be a very big night for the House. It’s got to be a really … Retire Pelosi. That’s not a bad idea. That’s going to be great. Congratulations, all. That’s already a great achievement. It really is. It’s already. But together, we’ll fulfill our contract with Black America and we’ll pass the Platinum Plan into law, and we’ll do it quickly and easily.

We’re also joined by a great friend of mine, Dr. Ben Carson. Where’s Ben? Where’s Ben? Ben. I love Ben. Special man. He’s doing a great job too. He’s been my friend from the beginning. Can I tell the one story, Ben? He came up to me, he was campaigning. He was the toughest. I tell you what, we had some really tough ones. A lot of them like to try and say they were tough, but they weren’t, like Kasich. Like Kasich. He only had one thing. He wouldn’t leave the race. He’d get minus one, he’s going on to the next one.

This guy did great. He was incredible. And he came up to me during the race and he was doing well, he said, “You know that you’re going to win, don’t you?” I said, “Excuse me.” He said, “You know you’re going to win.” He was doing great. And he was really in second and third and fourth and back to second. I mean, he was right up there. He was great. I learned, I said, “We got to get this guy out of here.” But he came up to me, he did. And he said, “You’re going to win.” And I’ll let him tell you the rest of the story if he’d like to do it sometime. But he gave a very specific reason. And I will never forget what he said. But he said, “You know you’re going to win, don’t you?” And I just thought it was really nice. And you know what I’m talking about, Ben. So Ben Carson, what a job he’s done too. Respected by everybody. Thank you, Ben. And a man who ran in the primary, who I got a call from another great man, David Perdue. He said, “Could you do us a favor? There’s a guy named Brian Kemp and he’s running in a tough primary, he’s got a tough opponent. And do you think you could maybe endorse him?” I love David Perdue. I said, “Who is he? I don’t know him. Okay?” And then he said, ” Well, he’s been for you.” I said, “Well, I’ve heard that before. I better be careful.” And we did a little … Where’s Brian? Where’s Brian? Right over here. Brian. We did a little research. We did a little research. And he has, he was for me all the way. And I said, “That’s good.” The worst thing is when you’re endorsing people that say bad things, right? He only said good. And I got to know him. And I got to know his wife, Marty. And I said, “Absolutely.” And we endorsed him and he won that primary so easily. He won so easily. And they’re still trying to figure out what happened in the race. I’ve been watching. You know what? It wasn’t that close. He won by a lot, actually. He didn’t win by 15 votes. He won by a lot. How many votes was that? That was a lot. Well, we won’t call it a landslide, but it wasn’t very close. You know? How many votes was that, Brian? It was a lot. 51. To me, you know what that is? It’s Yankee Stadium for a World Series. People would say, “Oh, that was tight.” I heard I won Michigan by 12,000. I said, “That’s an almost full Madison Square Garden. Not quite full.” But that’s Yankee Stadium for the World Series. I think that’s a lot. We look at it differently.

But I do want to introduce also David Perdue, who he is really an incredible guy. He loves everybody in this room. Where’s David? David. Please stand up. Is that right? Did you make that call? You made that call. He made that call. And that was a good call because your governor’s doing a great job and David’s doing a great job. And I hope you can support David and Brian and all of them. They’re incredible people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, David, for everything. Thanks also to Oklahoma’s first Black Speaker of the House, T.W. Shannon. Where’s T.W.? I like that. I want to do that. I want to do that. Thank you, T.W. Great reputation. Thank you very much. And a friend of mine who my children, you know, they’ll always be children. They may be a little older than children, but they’re always my children. They love her, Lynne Patton. Lynne, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lynne. Thank you.

And if you’re a UFC fan, anybody like UFC? I’ll tell you what. That’s right. Usman. He goes Usman. I know who he is. He’s tough, that’s who he is. Kamaru Usman, where is our champ? Come on, champ. Get up. Man, oh man, oh man. What a fighter you are. I don’t want to mess with him. I may weigh a couple of pounds more. Do you think I could take you to fight you? I don’t think so. He goes, “No.” I think you’re right, champ. But I watched a fight you had a couple of months ago, unbelievable talent. But right up here too, it’s a combination. The muscles are important, but you got to have the other. He actually looks very good in a suit, but he’s one of the few people that look better without a suit. There aren’t too many of us. Hey, there aren’t too many of us that can say that. Right? Right, men? The men in this audience, huh? But I just want to thank you, champion. Good luck. I’ll be watching you. You have a big fight coming up and I’ll be watching, and it’s a great group of people. Great group of champions. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Another great fighter, Ali Abdelaziz, who is tough. Where is he? There he is. Oh, you’re tough. You’re so tough, the two of you guys. I’d like to see you both fight, but there’s a little weight difference, I guess. Right? You probably think you can take him, right? But what is the difference in weight? What is it? 20? 10? I know, I know.

… 20, 10. I know. I know. I know. What is it though because… and were you a fighter at one time? You’re pretty good? Not good as him. Nobody else is either. So that’s easy. You were a good fighter. Also, Atlanta’s top hip hop producer, Polow. Where is he? Where is he? Da Don. Don King used to call me the don, right? He still does actually. but you didn’t get it from Don King I know that, right? Nice to see you. Great to have you. Great to have you. Thank you very much. Do we have another UFC fighter here because I have heard, yes? Because I know we had somebody else. I just don’t want to skip in case we do. I have a lot of respect for them. Anybody gets in a ring and does that and comes out winning, to me, I have a lot of respect. And when you become the champ, I want to tell you, that’s a hell of a thing. That’s what you live for, the belt, right? The money or the belt? You know what? If you get the belt, the money comes, right? So great. Great going champ. Fantastic. Over the last 50 years, Black Americans have mostly voted Democrat, but everyday more Black Americans are deciding that the old way is not working. Five decades of evidence proved that Democrat politicians do not care about the black community. They only care about power for themselves, whatever that means. My opponent is offering Black Americans nothing but the same old tired, empty slogans. By the way, he’s staying in again today. The guy. Hey champ, if I lose to a guy that… that’s like you losing to a fighter that hasn’t worked out in the last six months. This guy never goes out. It’s terrible. Oh, you better make sure I win. I’m going to be very embarrassed. I lost to a guy that didn’t campaign. You know why he’s not campaigning? I guess it’s an energy factor.
 44:06)
So what the hell is going… if I lose to a man that doesn’t campaign. Every day he announced we’re going to stay in today. I don’t know. Hey, I can’t tell you, but the Democrats are angry at him. They say, “You can’t do that.” I just left Florida and from here I’m going to Washington then I’m going to Virginia, then I’m going to someplace else and someplace else. By the way, I see Kelly and I see Collins back there. Will you please stand up? Please. Those are two champions. So they had their names in there, but they took them out. You know why? Because they probably want to not mention them together. They’re going to end up liking each other, you watch. And they you’re great people. I’m not going to skip them over. They go to be a diplomatic. That’s that diplomatic, that’s stupid, right? But I stand here to offer solutions. I want to congratulate you both. Really fighting a good fight. I want to say that both of you, Doug, Kelly. Really great. Well, I sort of like it. You know why?

They’re going to be in there fighting, fighting, fighting. Don’t anybody get out. And everybody’s going to come with them. And the only thing I know for sure, they’re all going to vote for me. Both of [ 00:45:30] So Brian, don’t let them get out. Don’t let anybody get out. But everyone’s going for both of them. It’s got to be, hey, we don’t have long to go either. We don’t have a long time ago. November 3rd. I’ve spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted on the black community over 47 years. 47 years. He always says, “Oh, I should have done this. I should…” I said you’ve been there for 47 years. It’s always great when they tell you what you should be doing and they haven’t done it themselves. And it’s not like it was 25 years ago that he left. He was there three and a half years ago, right? So it’s one of those things. No one in Washington politics today has done more to hurt Black Americans than Joe Biden. Its true.

For half a century, Joe’s personally advocated or enacted virtually every policy that has caused pain and suffering in the black community. You know that. Joe Biden shipped millions of your best jobs overseas, hollowed out the black middle-class and with open borders, trapped children in failing government schools. Sent young men to fight in endless wars. They just never ended. They’re coming back home. You see that. They’re coming back home. Many are already back. While our inner cities crumbled at home and made cities less safe and less secure. Joe Biden should not be demanding your support, he should be begging for your forgiveness. He really should be. He should be. My opponent drafted the 1994 disaster, the 1994 crime bill which caused unfair sentencing disparities that devastated black families. And I mean just… I have heard more about the 1994 and when we did criminal justice reform, it was largely about erasing that terrible act. That was his deal. I rolled back the unfair provisions of the 1994 Biden crime bill. And I signed it into groundbreaking criminal justice reform, which people are so happy about.

Even my enemies are saying, thank you for that. Today, we’re glad to be joined by the first person to be released under thee First Step Act who I was honored to have as my guest at the State of the Union. A really wonderful man, Matthew Charles. Where’s Matthew? Where is Mathew? Where is Matthew? What a good man. What a smile. I looked at that smile from the podium downstairs. I was surrounded by all those killer politicians. And I looked at Matthew’s and nicest looking guy in that house. Thank you, Matthew. You’re doing well, Matthew, right? That’s great, Matthew. You deserve what you got. You deserve it. Biden supported the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization which eliminated one in four manufacturing jobs held by Black Americans. You know that.

Joe Biden’s globalist agenda closed down factories in Baltimore and sent them… just see what happened to all these factories, all these jobs, all of these factories, sent them to Beijing. He shuttered the plants in Michigan and he sent them to Mexico. I replaced NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals, one of the worst stupidest deals I’ve ever seen in my life with the new US-Mexico-Canada agreement, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. That was one they said could not be done, David. Right? They said it couldn’t be done. David Perdue. They said that one couldn’t be done, right, David? And we got it done in pretty quick time too. To revitalize neglected communities, we created nearly 9,000 opportunities zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. You know Tim Scott. Tim Scott is great.

Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina came to my office, came to the Oval Office and he had this idea. And I said, “That sounds good.” And we got it done. And people were surprised that we could even get it done. And it has turned out to be incredible. $75 billion dollars of investment have poured into these neighborhoods, which will create an estimated 500,000 jobs and lift 1 million Americans out of poverty. When the China virus struck, we raced to ensure that Black Americans had the medical care and the financial support that they needed through the Paycheck Protection Program, which was a big deal. We helped save over 200,000 black owned, small businesses. A lot of small businesses. It’s incredible. The black community has tremendous talent in terms of those businesses and small businesses. We saved at least 200, 000 of them. As we continue to battle the virus, my administration is sheltering those at highest risk while rapidly developing treatments. And the vaccine is coming very quickly.

I see where a couple of the Democrats don’t want to have the vaccine because they said, “Well, we don’t want it because we think Trump is pushing it too fast.” Well, that’s the reason we’re going to have it. This would have taken years to get. We’re years ahead of schedule. And this would have been two, three years by Democrats. But now they’re very concerned because they’re afraid it’s happening too fast and that means we’re going to get credit. I don’t want credit. We want to save lives. We will crush the virus, our opponents will crush the black middle-class. That’s what they’ve been doing. And they’ve been doing it for a long time. For too long. They will deliver a crippling shutdown and a very steep depression. If he gets elected, this guy, you will have the greatest depression that this country has ever seen. And that includes a pretty big one in 1929. Hello. How are you? Great. I love her dress. That’s great. Thank you for being here. I didn’t know you were going to be here. Thank you very much.

Nearly 1.3 million African-Americans have gotten jobs in the last four months alone. And next year I think it’ll be, economically, the greatest year in the history of our country. And that’s good for everyone. That’s good for everybody, right? Especially for these young geniuses, these young political geniuses that are coming along. But I think we’re going to have the greatest year in the history of our country economically. And I think our third quarter, which happens to be… it’s going to be announced two days before… the numbers come out two days before the election, right at the beginning of November. And I mean, I’ll say it now. These people, all those people up there, they’ll hold me to it. They won’t give me credit if I was right but if I was wrong, it’ll be headlines. We have breaking news. Trump said wrong. But I think we’re going to have a tremendous third quarter. After years of rebuilding other countries, we’re finally rebuilding our country. The path to the American dream has always been education. Republicans believe that school choice is the civil rights issue of our time. And Joe Biden isn’t allowed to go there because of the radical left. He’s controlled by the radical left totally. He’s exhausted. But Biden’s promised a ban on charter schools and to oppose school choice. Joe Biden is willing to spend billions and billions upon resettling refugees from all around the world, but he won’t spend one penny providing school choice to black children in America which is interesting. During their first year in office, President Obama and VP Biden cut funding for historically black colleges and universities. I’ve increased HBCU funding and I made it permanent. Just a quick story. So what was happening is that, the first year I saw these probably 42 people came up and they were the heads of individual colleges, historically black colleges, universities. And they were the heads and I see them and I said, “Oh, hello, how you doing?” They were nice people. And we took a picture in the White House. We do that. A lot of presidents don’t believe anyone should ever enter the Oval Office but them.

With me, I say, “Come on in.” But we took it picture. Then the next year they were there again. And I said, “Right. We know the story my friend. We know the story.” They were there and I said, “Oh, what are you doing back here?” They said, “We’re here because we need money again.” I said, “What do you mean again?” And I forgot about it. I said, “All right. Well, whatevs.” And they got it. And then the third year, David, they came in again, right? And I said, “What is this? What are you guys here for? I mean, you’re great people, but why?” Well, we don’t have any funding. They don’t have permanent funding. So they could be shut out if they had the wrong president. Honestly, you could have the wrong president and you wouldn’t get 25 cents. They wouldn’t give you anything.

And I said, “That’s terrible. So you come up here every… do you like doing it?” No. And the one gentleman looked at me, he said, “We feel like beggars.” That was a hell of a statement. I said, “I understand that.” And I said, “We can’t let this happen.” So we worked on it, David Purdue, all of us worked on it. Kelly worked on it. We all worked on it. And I have to say it had to go through the House. And where’s Doug? Doug worked on it. Right Doug? You remember that? That was a hard thing. It wasn’t easy. There were people that didn’t want to do it. And we got it passed. We got more money than they asked for. I said, “You’re going to need more.” I’m in the real estate business. I said, “You always need more. Whatever you think you need, you need more.”

But we got more money than they asked for and we got it for a period of 10 years, right? So I said, the only bad… we signed it together. About 42 people. We signed it together. I said, “The only bad thing is that I like your people, I won’t see you anymore. I won’t see you for another 10 years.” Let’s say, will we be president in 10 years? Only if we add a couple of terms. Now we have a story. This is your breaking news. I told you, he’s a dictator. We’ve been saying… he will not give up power. Under no circumstances will he give up power. He intends to serve at least two more terms. Oh, that’s a [ 00:56:57]. You can’t joke, because if you joke, they take it away. A lot of times you add a little sarcasm in your joke, but your big serious, and then you start laughing afterwards. But they always cut it before the laugh. They cut it so that they think he’s serious. He wants 12 more years. They start shouting now, 12 more years.

Thank you. Earlier this year, Biden said that if you don’t vote for him, then you aren’t black. You know that. And this was very outrageous. This is offensive. In fact, he was very derisive of the Black Americans when he very negatively compared them to another group of Americans. It was very terrible. And he did it. Biden believes that all Black Americans have to think the same way. That’s what it was all about. Today’s Democrat Party is run by… he doesn’t know Black Americans like I do. Today’s Democratic party is run by out of touch, liberal hypocrites who stereotype you, disrespect you and sell you out. They’re only good for your six month period. Six months before the election and then they’re very nice and they want your vote and then they, as you say, I like that better than what I was to say, they forget all about you. They’re gone. They’re gone. Biden wants to lecture the country about racial justice when he spent his career hurting Black Americans, hurting Hispanic Americans and forging alliances with pro segregation Democrat senators, you know that.

Racial justice begins with Joe Biden’s retirement from public life. So today I’m urging Black Americans to walk away from the corrupt, hateful, divisive, and very extreme. And they are going crazy, Democrat Party. On no issue has the Democrat Party more totally failed the black community than public safety. Democrats have run America’s inner cities at every level of government for 100 years and even more. Last year, 19 of the top 20 most dangerous cities in America were run by Democrats. The murder rate is higher in Baltimore than in Afghanistan, El Salvador, or Honduras, right? It’s higher. Instead of fighting for public safety for these communities, the Democrats are attacking our police and empowering far left rioters, looters, and anarchists. They are anarchist. The Democrat Party’s war on cops has caused black owned businesses to be burned and black homes and churches to be totally destroyed. Most tragically of all, so many innocent black lives have been cruelly taken from us. People are dying by the thousands and black on black crime, and I want it to stop.

And people aren’t talking about it. They’re not talking about it. They’re not talking about it. In Chicago, as an example, there are weekends when 60, 70, or more people are shot. This is shot and many die. How can we allow this to go on? How can we allow this to happen? But they’re all Democrat run cities. Every year thousands of African-Americans are murdered as a result of violent crime. And again, in these Democrat run monstrosities. The way they run them, it’s worse than Afghanistan. It’s worse than… we are at war. We go to war zones and we don’t lose this many people in war zones. Democrats ignore these American victims and I won’t. And we have to be asked to come in. We have to be asked to come in. By law, they have to say, please come in. And wherever we’ve gone in, Minneapolis, we went in and we solved the problem. They should have called us two weeks earlier. They would have had a city left. But Seattle, they knew we were coming in. I said, “We’re going in? We don’t care. We’re going in.” And night before we went in, they left.

That was the end of that and others. I mean, look at Portland. I mean, how bad is Portland? How bad is Portland? And we could solve that one in about a half an hour. A bunch of young anarchists. They live with their parents in a basement also. They live in the And I’ll always support the heroes of law enforcement, we have to. Including over 50,000 incredible black police officers who risk their lives every day to keep us all safe. They protect people that they’ve never met before. And it’s very dangerous. They’re amazing. Those pushing to defund the police are hurting black communities the most. And as I’ve always said, when there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully responsible and accountable and they will. And they will do that. Politicians supporting mob violence are not allies of the black community, they’re causing extraordinary damage grief hardship. In recent months, our nation is grieved for the tragic deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery. Our hearts break for their families and for all families who have lost a loved one, especially if you look at it this way. So senseless. But we can never allow mob-rule. To have safety, to have prosperity, to have everything that you want to have, we must always ensure the rule of law. As you know, we have to-

… rule of law. As you know, we have to. Many of those who are spreading violence in our cities are supporters of an organization called the Black Lives Matter or BLM. It’s really hurting the black community. It’s hurting the black community. This is an unusual name for an organization whose ideology and tactics are right now destroying many black lives and whose first phrase was, you remember this, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” referring to our police. That’s referring to our police. The stated goal of BLM organization people is to achieve the destruction of the nuclear family, abolish the police, abolish prisons, abolish border security, abolish capitalism, and abolish school choice. That’s what their stated goals are.

This is not the agenda of the black community. This is the agenda of an extreme socialist, or worse, you know what the other word is. Yeah, Marxist, communist. But this is the extreme socialist left, but beyond that, in my opinion. That’s why the founders of the organization call themselves “trained Marxists.” And yet we have major corporations out of weakness or fear or whatever reason donating hundreds of millions of dollars to them. These are fools. These are fools. The big progressive corporations donating to BLM should instead be spending their money helping black families rebuild from these horrible left-wing riots. Wealthy liberal hypocrites want to defund the police in our inner cities while living behind walled compounds. Their walled compounds. You got to see the way some of these people live. They live pretty well. The funny thing is that if anything ever happened, they’d be the first to go. You know that, right? “Let’s go get these people.”

They’re fools. They want to get rid of school choice for black children while sending their own children to the best private schools in the land. They want to open borders, and that’s what they want, they want open borders for you but security for themselves. They want top security, but let’s open up the borders. Let’s let everybody pour into our country so that you won’t have jobs left, you won’t have anything left. And it’s a tremendous public health crisis. We built now over 330 miles of wall and it will be finished soon. Our numbers are in the border are now the best they’ve been in decades and it’s incredible what’s happened. The wall has been incredible. 330 miles, David, that’s pretty good.

A long way considering we had a party that didn’t want to let us build the wall. They wanted the wall 10 years ago. They really wanted the wall. And as soon as I wanted it, they didn’t want it. And I said it last night. We had a tremendous rally last night with probably 35,000 people. I said it last night, I said I made a mistake. I should have said, “We will not build a wall,” and we would have had funding in about 15 minutes. Instead, I had to win six different lawsuits. This was not easy. Crazy Nancy. She’s crazy. And do you notice how quiet it is now? Now that it’s 330 miles, it’ll be completed, we’re doing 10 miles a day on average. Think of this. I don’t hear any more about the wall. They don’t want to talk about the wall anymore, but the numbers are great.

Republicans will always uphold equal justice under the law. We will defend the civil rights of every single American, and we will defend our God-given freedoms, including religious liberty. And the Second Amendment, by the way. I have to save our Second Amendment. I’m the only thing standing between you and me and Second Amendment, I’m standing. We’re not going to be losing our Second Amendment. They’re going to get rid of it. You know who they put it in charge? Beto. Remember Beto? Beto O’Rourke. That’s a Spanish name. He needed the Spanish vote, right? He said, “I want Spanish.” I said, “What about Hispanic?” He said, “I don’t know about that.” He knows less about it than perhaps I do.

But Beto, I remember he had a cover in a terrible magazine. And they said he said that, “I was born to run for president.” He was hot then even though he just lost a race to. He was hot, and he said, “I was born to run for president.” Anybody that says that is a sure loser. Can you imagine if I said that, I said, “I was born to run for president.” You’d say, “This guy’s whacked out.” It’s not an easy deal going on over here. I had a very nice life before, you know that? You read about my life. You knew a lot about my life. I had a great life. What the hell did I do this for, David? Why did I do this for, David Purdue?

No, I enjoy it. You know why I enjoy it? I love it. Oh, by the way, did you see, they just got the FBI? Did you see the text messages? It’s brutal. One of the guys said, “Listen, this is really illegal. I want insurance.” They bought insurance for these people because they thought they’re going to be locked up. We got it. Now they’re going crazy. This is the hottest thing right now on the internet all over the place, boy. They’ve been looking at me. So essentially then, it was the exact opposite. And you see Biden’s son? He got three and a half… Hunter. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? You know what I do? I call him “Where’s Hunter.” That’s his name. Where’s Hunter. We made a t-shirt, I was making a speech, I said, “Where’s Hunter?” I’m looking at this… I was kidding. I said, “Where’s Hunter?” The next day it was the biggest selling t-shirt in the history. Where’s Hunter?

No, Hunter got a check back from the wife of the mayor of Moscow for three and a half million. Would anybody except whatever he was supposed to do for three and a half million? There’s no job that I can think of. Three and a half million. Now before Biden became vice president, he got nothing. He had no money, no nothing. Got thrown out of the military. He got thrown out. He had no job. Now he’s getting checks for three and a half million from the mayor, the ex mayor, very substantial person, by the way, of Moscow. So we got it wrong. It wasn’t Trump. I have nothing to do. I didn’t have a phone call. Now think of it, let’s call Bob Mueller, put him on the case. Thank you. He said, “Let’s call Bob Mueller.” I stole from him. Hey, I plagiarized from him like Biden. That was very good. He says, “Let’s call Bob Miller.” Bob’s a sharp guy. He’ll get him. He’ll figure it out.

How about me? Three years of investigation, [ 00:07:49], they find nothing. A friend of mine, very smart in New York said, very smart, he said, “You must be the most honest person and in the world. When 19 geniuses, bad people, but geniuses, plus unlimited law enforcement, 49 FBI agents, two and a half years, can’t find anything. You got to be the cleanest person in the world.” But it turned out to be the opposite story. It was them who was dealing with Russia. David, if you guys could start working on that when you get back. Doug, please, if you don’t mind. You were so incredible to me, and if you don’t mind, think of it, it was the exact opposite, Doug. He’s trying to defend us. “Please, defend the president.” Well, it turned out to be the opposite. They were the ones that were dealing with Russia. It was a disinformation campaign. Kelly, start working on that with David, please. Okay? I think Monday morning would be okay.

We are appointing a Supreme Court justice today. We are. That’s a big deal. The Democrats, they don’t think we should do it, because actually we have a lot of time left. It’s really January 20th. We have a lot of time left, but they don’t think we should do it because it’s toward the end of the fist. Well, we’ve got a lot of time left. Now, put them in our shoes. You think they’d say, “Well, I think we should probably not do this.” What chance do we have of that, Dave? Zero, would you say? No, the only difference is they would have gone even crazier. They would have gotten totally. They would have been fighting, “Let’s get it done immediately.” They would be working over the weekend. They have been not good to deal with.

But you know what? When we built this great success, it started to all come together, then we got interrupted by China. What they did, they should never have done that. They should remember this, we can never forget it. But it was starting to come together, and it will come together because we’re going to have an even greater success, in my opinion, next year. Well, Democrats have tried to silence pastors, and we had some great pastors up here. I watched backstage. I watched those guys and I said, “I don’t want to follow them. I want to follow them.” I was looking for somebody else to speak first. But they were great. Weren’t they really great? You know the truth. I could see, they love you, they love the country. They at least like me, because you know what? If they didn’t, they couldn’t do what they just did. They did it from the heart. Didn’t they? Really. I watched that. I won’t forget it either. I’m never going to forget it. I’m not forgetting. I don’t forget things.
Thank you. I don’t forget things. Where are the pastors? They got up. Where are they? Where are they? Where are those guys? Man, oh man. I’ll never follow you again. At least we had Herschel in between, right? And Herschel didn’t like it either. That was really great. Thank you both. Thank you all very much. That was beautiful. That was from the heart and we appreciate it. We won’t forget. We won’t forget. I will fiercely defend the vital role of black churches in America. Joe Biden and the Democrats say that black lives matter but they do not protect the most vulnerable black lives of all; unborn children. They support the unlimited abortion of black children right up until the ninth month of pregnancy. And if you look at this governor of Virginia beyond, I had not heard that. But if you look at the governor of Virginia, he said, “The baby is born, and then they start to talk.”

I said, “Wait a minute, that’s not abortion. That’s not abortion. You know what that is? No, I call it execution. You’ve seen that, right? I had not heard that. You hear late term abortion. You never heard that. But the governor of Virginia, the one that thinks he’s Michael Jackson, the one whose wife stopped him from trying to imitate Michael Jackson moonwalk. Now one thing we know, he’s not going to be Michael. There’s nobody that can moonwalk like Michael. See. he got very lucky. That would have been the end if he would’ve done that. But the Democrat’s champion Planned Parenthood, an organization founded on racism that continues to target the black community. In the Republican party, we believe in protecting all black lives, including the unborn.

We believe that every child, of every race, born and unborn is made in the holy image of God. Republicans believe that all human life is sacred. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. Now, you know that. There’s never been a difference like this. Our opponents want our children to grow up in a socialist nation. That will mean less opportunity, less prosperity, less safety and less hope for the future. The Democrat party’s message to your children is that their path is doomed and that their country is evil. My message to every child in America is the exact opposite. I want our children to know that they are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, anyone can rise.

Democrats divide our country by race, Republicans unite Americans through our shared bonds of citizenship. You see it here. This glorious country is the shared heritage of all Americans. In every generation, black patriots poured out their blood, sweat, heart, and soul to defend American liberty and to realize our founding promise that we are all made equal by the hand of all mighty God. African American leaders lifted up the conscience of our nation to end slavery and segregation and secure your civil rights. Black heroes like Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and Thurgood Marshall help the most just noble free and exceptional nation on earth.

Now with the help of a new generation of black patriots, and there, some of them are right now, we will reach new heights of glory and greatness. And you know this; we are going to revitalize our cities. It’s in the process. We will bring more jobs in factories back to our communities. We will give every single child a chance to reach their full God-given potential. We will build the most inclusive society, the most successful economy, and the most inspiring future the world has ever seen. And we will do it for citizens of every background, every race, religion, color, and creed. Together we made unbelievable progress and achieved once unimaginable success. Nobody thought it was possible. And with your support, your vote, and your voice, the best is yet to come

So this has been a great honor for me. I have a lot of friends in the audience, and I just want to thank you very much. God bless you. God bless America. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.",25/9/20
"Thank you very much. Hello, Newport News. I know it well. I know it well. I know it well. You know, my father and I had a couple of little jobs here and they were great. When the ships came in, they were packed. When the ships out, they were stone cold empty. I said, “This is a different kind of a place.” But we loved it, and it’s a great place. And I’m thrilled to be back in the Commonwealth of Virginia with the thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. And I also want to thank the great people of North Carolina. Who’s here from North Carolina? Not bad, it’s a little area there.

39 Days from now, we’re going to win Virginia. We’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the white house and keep doing what we’ve been doing because it’s never been anything quite like it. This is the most important election in the history of our country. One of the biggest issues for the people of Virginia is your second amendment. And if sleepy Joe Biden wins, your second amendment will be eliminated and your firearms will be confiscated. Whether you like it or not. When asked if a Biden administration was coming after your guns, Biden replied, “Yes.” Fully had to say yes.

He promised to put the gun grabber, Beto O’Rourke … you know Beto, Beto. Remember Beto? He was on the cover of a third rate magazine and he said, “I was born to run for president.” That was the end of his run. That’s what it ended. Anytime they say they were born to do it they got problems. That didn’t work out, it was a steep drop. But he put Beto in charge of his assault on your guns and you know what happened with Beto, Beto went crazy. He wants to take your guns away. Biden vows to impose punishing taxes on gun owners. Outlaw many of the most popular firearms in America, create a national gun registry, and wage the most aggressive war on gun rights in US history.

Biden will disarm law abiding Americans. At the same time, they’ll have riots down your street and that’s just fine. That’s okay. That’s okay, according to the left wing. Only by voting for me can you save your country and can you save your second amendment.

So I was told not to go for Virginia. We did really well last time and I never came, I never did anything, and we did really well. I said, “Why didn’t I go for Virginia?” But it’s traditionally not a Republican state over the last number of decades. And I said, “Why not?” You have a crazy governor and every time I see it, every two weeks he’s trying to take your guns away, right?

And he’ll attack constantly right to life. And you know, he’s so far left, he doesn’t even talk about late term, he talks about after the baby was born. Which is the first time I ever heard of that. You hear late term, but he said and after the baby is born we’ll start talking to mother. In other words, he’s talking about execution of the baby. Execution. You have a governor that thinks he’s Michael Jackson. Remember his wife saved him. Remember he wanted to prove that he was just dressed up like Michael Jackson and that he sometimes thought when he was young that he resembled Michael Jackson. I don’t think so. And you remember he wanted to moonwalk across the stage and his wife said, “No, no, don’t do it, darling. Don’t please, darling.” Nobody moonwalks like Michael. That would have been good, I wish I could have seen that. That would not have been pretty.

So based on your governor and based on the fact that he’s always … every like month you’re fighting for guns. If I’m not here, your second amendment is gone and I’m talking about all over the country. Forget about just Virginia. So I said, “Let’s give Virginia shot.” We’re nearby, right? We’re nearby. I even said, “We’ll bring in the heavy artillery. We’ll bring in our great vice president, Mike Pence.” Did he do a good job?

I’ll tell you what, Kamala, Kamala is no Mike Pence. She’s no Mike Pence. No, he’s great. He’s done a fantastic job. And he’s with you all the way. So I said, “Let’s give it a shot.” And you know, there’s a big difference. I tell you what, there’s never been a bigger difference between candidates or parties, never been. No party that supports, as an example, what he would do to a child after it was born is fit to be even involved in any way in this nation, let alone running this nation. As you know, sleepy Joe Biden endorsed your governor. So that means he endorsed the policy of your governor. That means he endorsed breaking up your second amendment. So it’ll either be totally broken up or it will be wiped out. Essentially it won’t be that much different.

So here we are in Virginia. Like I had nothing to do today. I woke at six in the morning, I read some papers. I read the fake news. And then I was in Florida early in the morning, and then I went to Florida and we did a big round table with the Hispanics. They were great. And then we flew to Atlanta from Florida, Palm Beach. And then we flew … We started off in all different places. We were all … And then we flew, we went to Miami. We started off. But I’ll tell you what, Florida’s great. We’re going to win Florida. We’re way up in Florida. Way up. Way up. Even a poll that gave me … I mean, I’ve never had a good number. ABC/Washington Post poll, it’s a terrible poll, always been bad. I think it got everything wrong four years ago. They said I’m four up or more, but I’m four up in the State of Florida. So anyway, so we went to Miami, went to a beautiful place actually in Miami, you know where that is, right? And we had, I won’t say because then they’ll say I’m advertising if I do [ 00:15:58]. I won’t say. I won’t say the name of the place, but it is beautiful. And then what happened is we went to Atlanta and we … so we left the great Hispanics. We call them the Latinos for Trump. Latino.

Where we are polling at numbers that I guess no Republican has ever polled before. Perhaps Abraham Lincoln, but in those days he wasn’t big into the Hispanic movement. I think Abraham had other things to think about, don’t we think? But I will say this, nobody has done more for many communities, but I always say for the Black community, nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump since Abraham Lincoln. Nobody.

So we flew to Atlanta and we had an unbelievable two hours. And this was with the African American community, the Black community. I always say, “What do you like better? Tell me what you like better.” They say, “Usually the Black community.” And what is the answer, tell me? African American. I don’t want to hear from other people, I want to hear. African American. What do you like better? African American or Black? It’s Black. Yeah, that’s what we hear. I’ll go with whatever you want. That’s your choice. We can use either one. I’ll go with whatever you want.

We had a great two hours, incredible people, Herschel Walker introduced me. Serious, serious guy. We had a lot of champion fighters, a lot of great people. It was an amazing time.

And then we flew to Washington where we had a round table. And then I say, “Well, that’s it for the night, right?” You know, this starts at six in the morning. So I said, “That’s it for the night? Is that it? I’ll go back home to the White House.” No, sir. Well, I wonder what … You’re going to Virginia, sir. Good. That’s good. Thank you, very much. This was like, I asked the question about an hour ago,” where am I going now?” Put me in coach, you ever hear the expression? Just wind me up and put me in coach. I said, “Where are we going tonight?” I said, “Let’s go back to the White House, let’s see our first lady.” And they said, “No, sir, you have a rally scheduled. You have a rally scheduled.” Where is it? In Virginia. I said, “That’s good. How many people?” They said, “A hell of a lot of people.

Well, I wouldn’t. I’m kidding. I’m kidding. I’m kidding. When you have rallies like this, you don’t forget them. You don’t forget them. Thank you, go ahead. Go ahead. What the hell.
No, so we’re going to put a heavy play in for Virginia. Seriously, we’re going to put a heavy play in Virginia. And I think we can win this state. Man, that crowd is big. Look at that, it goes way back to the hanger. That is a big crowd. That’s good. You know, I always tell the cameras, “I don’t want to bore people with this,” but I implore them, turn the cameras around and show them the size of this crowd. It Goes back to the building. But they never like doing it because they don’t like including Fox, they don’t like showing big crowds. You know, they don’t like showing big crowds. We left Ohio. We’re way up in Ohio. Way up in Ohio. We’re way up in Georgia. We were in Georgia today though with the governor and the senator, Senator Perdue. And Representative Doug Collins, great guy, Kelly Loeffler, great person, Senator, and Senator Perdue. And I said, “How are we doing?” They said, “You’re winning by a lot in Georgia. You’re winning by a lot.” Of course, if you see these people, they’ll say, “He’s pretty close in Georgia. Too close to call.” And then we have election night comes, the polls in Georgia are close. Donald Trump has won the State of Georgia.” You only win if you’re up by, like a lot. If you’re by a lot, they announce it … That was what happened with Texas last time. They said Texas is too close to call. All for months and months and months. The only one that didn’t believe that were the people in Texas. So when it closed, they said the polls in Texas are closed, Donald Trump has won-

The polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump has won that state, like in the same breath. Nah, we’re doing great in Texas. We’re doing great all over the place. We’re doing great all over. I hear we’re up in New Hampshire, which is great. Last time that one got taken away from us with the people that just came in with buses all over the place. They had buses coming up from Massachusetts. You have the RINO governor, you know, the RINO governor of Massachusetts, right? Baker. He’s a RINO but I guess he does whatever he can to get elected.

The Democrat party is now run by socialists and Marxists who want to destroy our laws, our values, and want to destroy your way of life. To uphold our Constitution as written, tomorrow I will be announcing my nominee to the United States Supreme Court.
Fill that seat. Oh, we’re going to fill it, don’t worry about it. And the Republicans have been very unified. You see that, very unified. Even a couple of people that normally don’t vote for with us. You know, they usually don’t vote with the Republicans, but they are. And we have tremendous unity in the party. Mitch is doing a good job. Kevin is doing a good job. We’re going to take over the House. We’re going to take back the House. People are tired of craziness. They’re tired.

We want to get some stimulus out. She doesn’t want to give it, only for political reasons. It’s not your fault. Do you know, whose fault it is? China’s fault. That’s whose fault it is. That’s whose fault it is. But you know, it’s an amazing thing because the Democrats are saying, “Well, it’s the end of a term.” You know, we have a lot of time left. Think think of this. If it were them… Don’t forget, we don’t have to do it by the election. But we should be really able. That would be a great victory, going into the election with that biggest of all victories.

You know, they say the biggest thing you can do is the appointment of judges, but especially the appointment of Supreme Court Justices. That’s the single biggest thing a president can do because it sets the tone of the country for 40 years, 50 years. I mean a long time. So we’re going to be announcing somebody great. I just watched, the great thing about Air Force One there are more televisions on that plane than any plane. They got them in every room. You open up for closet. You want a shirt. Let me open, “Oh, there’s a television.”

And I’m watching the Democrats saying how terrible it is that we’re appointing. We have the right. We won the election, right? Then we have the right. We won the election. We have a lot of time, and if they weren’t in opposition, they would do the same thing. Maybe they would just do it more rapidly. Okay? More rapidly. So tomorrow I think is going to be a big day. Five o’clock tomorrow at the White House, we’re going to be naming the nominee, hopefully will be on that court for 50 years. Five-oh, fifty years. Be on there for 50 years. The only thing I can tell you for sure is it will be a woman. Is that okay?
Does anybody have any objections to that?
Please raise your hand. A lot of cowards out there. Look at you, men. There’s not one man here that has the guts to raise your hand. Not one. If given the power, the radical left we’ll pack the Supreme Court with extremists who will strike the words “under God” from the pledge of allegiance as they did twice. I heard their pledge of allegiance. They had it in their caucus. I’m watching. I said, “Oh, they made a mistake.” I said to the First Lady, “Darling, they made a mistake. They left the words ‘under God’ out.” And then I heard it a second time and they made the same mistake. I said, “This is strange.”

This is like the guys on the Mueller team. They cleaned their phones, right? 31 phones. And they said, “Oh, we made a mistake.” And they all made the exact same mistake. The odds of that are a billion to one, right? They all made… Oh, they got caught. Did you see what’s going on. Oh, they got caught. Hey, I feel sorry. That’s a shame.
Yeah. They should be, I’ll tell you. They should be. They’re crooked people. They’re crooked people. So they cleaned up their phones. Hillary took her phones and smashed them. She took 33,000 emails and deleted them after Congress requested them. And I think they’re looking at that too. I think so. I think so.

Can you imagine? I have a friend he’s very smart. Rich guy made a lot of money, but he’s a very streetwise guy. He said, “You know, you’ve been under investigation by these thieves, and they’re smart.” They just weren’t smart when they all use the same exact method to clean their phones. That wasn’t smart. You know, at least put it in a little bit different. 31 different phones. Like what is it? 21 people, 31 phones. But that’s okay. That’s okay. That’s only illegal. But this friend of mine said, “You know, they’ve gone through everything. They’ve gone through your taxes. They’ve gone through your financials. They’ve gone through everything. You have to be the most honest guy in the world.”

And they come up, no collusion. Oh, if they found anything. No, it’s a bad group of people headed by Robert Mueller. Bad group of people. Who wanted the job at the FBI. But he lied to Congress. He said he didn’t say that, but he did. I bet he did. We have all the proof. So he is in the same group you know? But they’re actually in worse shape because at least with Mueller, you can say, he probably didn’t know what the hell he was doing. Sort of like Joe Biden. I figure about the same. Does that make sense? Does anybody under-

How would you like to you’re getting a divorce or something, and you say, “I got to be represented by Bob Mueller.” You think so? You saw his performance in Congress, right? I want to be represented by Bob Mueller. No. The same thing. How can we have Joe Biden representing this country?
And he’s on the lid. You know the lid, right? The lid is where they say we’re going to put a lid on it. So I guess it means probably what it’s supposed to. I have no idea. The lid, it’s a lid. But it’s an expression. And every day, early in the morning, they say, “Joe, Joe.” I mean, Joe Biden, sleepy Joe. He’s put a lid on it. Sir, Biden has put a lid on it. What does that mean? That means he’s not working today. This guy takes more days off. You will have to have a president that’s going to work his ass off for this country. We need everything. We need a very energetic president.

They said, “How do you think he’s going to do in the debate?” I think good. He’s been doing it for 47 years. I think he’s going to do good. I think. And one thing we know if he does just okay, just okay, they’re going to say, the fake news, they’re going to say it was the single greatest debate performance in history. It was unbelievable, far better than Winston Churchill in his prime. Winston Churchill was nothing compared to this sleepy Joe.

So you know that. If he finishes the debate, if he finishes, which I think he will. And he might even do well. But if he does well they’re going to say it’s the greatest debate. And they have it already written. They have a couple of scenarios. If he does really poorly, they’re going to say he wasn’t bad. He wasn’t bad. If he does modestly well, like he did against Bernie, they were sort of even. If he does like that, they’ll say it was the greatest performance in history. But with your vote, I will preserve our Constitution and ensure law and order.
Joe Biden is weak. He surrendered his party to the flag burners, the rioters, the anti-police anarchists, the radicals. All these guys running around these Democrat-run cities and states, look at it. 10 out of 10. We could fix up Portland so fast. They have to invite us. And I want to be invited into that one. We would fix that like we did Minneapolis. We would fix that up in less than a half an hour. Remember Minneapolis, they were a riot. I mean, the problem is they invited us in about two weeks. By the time they invited, it was a lot of flames behind them. Remember the reporter, he’s standing there. “This is a peaceful protest,” and behind him, you have like blocks. It looked like Berlin during the war, didn’t it? I never saw anything. This is the craziest thing. It’s a peaceful performance.

But what we did, we said it’s a peaceful protest. And we don’t call these rallies anymore because in Dem states like where you have a governor who’s a Democrat, you’re not allowed to go to church and not allowed to go to a restaurant. You’re not allowed to go to your friend’s house. You can’t move from your house unless you’re related to the governor. Then you can do whatever the hell you want. You can’t do anything. You can’t do anything, unless of course it’s a peaceful protest. Okay?

So what we do is we call these peaceful protests, and we’re getting big crowds. 25-30,000. 35,000. There’s more enthusiasm now than there was four years ago because we’ve done a good job, right? There’s more now. Now we have more enthusiasm now than we did. You know, it’s interesting. Don’t forget, four years ago, I did a nice job. I was successful. Had a great television show, The Apprentice. It was great. People got to know me a little bit. I said, “Let me run.”

From the time, the first hour that we came down the escalator, First Lady and I down the escalator, her with a white dress, right? Very famous escalator right now. People go take pictures of the escalator. But we came down the escalator. We were in first place, right? We never went, I never left center stage, right? And that’s based on poll numbers, if you’re the number one poller. And I said, “Look, I want an odd number. I don’t want an even number.” They said, “What are you talking?” I said, “Because that means two people are in center and that’s not fair. So I want an odd number.” We were on center stage.

But we’ve done a good job. What happened is I came. I said I was going to cut your taxes. We gave you the biggest tax decrease in history, right? I said I was going to cut regulations and we were going to have an incredible economy. And regulations were probably even more important than the tax cuts. Okay? You want to know the truth. You ask the business people, the great ones, they will tell you if they had a choice, they’ll take the regulation cuts. And we still have a ways to go with that. But we did that.

We rebuilt your military. We added Space Force. I mean, what we’ve done Is far more, far more. Right to try, how about right to try? I never talked about that. I never talked about that. We knocked out 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Right?
We achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our very pristine environment, by the way. And earlier this month… Oh, you’re going to be so happy, Virginia and North Carolina. Come on North Carolina, you’re going to be so happy. You’re going to be cheering like crazy, because I think you’ll like this. But about a month ago I signed an order prohibiting offshore drilling on the Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coast, right? Right? And because I happen to like this state a lot, I said, ” What about Virginia? What about North Carolina?” And somebody said, “I don’t know. I don’t know if they like it.” I said, “I think they like it.” So I’m extending the moratorium to North Carolina and Virginia. Okay?
And if you want to have oil rigs out there, just let me know. We’ll take it off. I mean, you know I can understand that too. I can understand that too, but I think you want it. So we’re extending it to Virginia. We’re extending it to North Carolina up the coast, and we’re not going to have any problems like can be had. All right? So I think you’ll like that. You don’t like it, you’re going to let me know, I’m going to change it. I can change things very easily.

We built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re quickly doing it again. So I did all of these things. And in doing all of these things, you said the second time, well now this is actually a much easier campaign in a way. I mean, the only problem is I’ve been tarred with this horrible witch hunt for four years and I didn’t do it.
No, think of it. What would my numbers be if I didn’t go through almost four years of a Russian witch hunt that turned out to be just the opposite. They were the ones that were involved with Russia. It was a whole big disinformation campaign. Now what would my numbers be with all that we’ve done, and if you didn’t hear night after night on fake news, CNN and MSDNC, and the New York Times and the Washington Post.

And now it’s turning out, not turning out, it’s done. Because if you look at everything that’s come out over the last few days, it’s we caught them. They’d been caught. They spied on my campaign and they tried for a coup. Can you believe it? In this day and age? And we caught them cold, so what would our numbers be? Our numbers, not mine. What would our numbers be? If every night, every morning, every day they were saying Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a total hoax. In fact, Biden’s son, it was just revealed two days ago, got three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Think of it.

But really, think about that. What would be? We did all these incredible things with the economy, with everything, and then we got hit with this virus from China. They should never have let it happen. We won’t forget it. And we closed up. We saved millions of lives. Now we’ve opened it. We’re opening to records. But what would our popularity be if every day for almost four years, you didn’t hear any of this bullshit, okay?
What would it be? It’s true. It’s true. What would they be with all we’ve done I think they would be very nice. The Democrats would say “Yes, if you’d like we could cancel the election because we have no chance.” But you know what? Hopefully they have no chance anyway. And hopefully you’re going to remember what I just said, because we were unjustly treated, unjustly accused by a bunch of treasonous crooks. They’re a bunch of bad, bad people who got caught. And I think they’ll have to pay a very substantial price.
When the plague arrived from China, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. You know, the question was asked to me, “How well did we do on the pandemic?” And I said, “I give us an A to an A+.” You look at the ventilators. You look at all we’ve done. We did a great job. We helped the governors. The governors are always very thankful. Then sometimes they’ll get in front of a camera. They’ll remember, some of them are Democrats, right? But I said, the only thing we did badly on was public relations because we were working so hard we didn’t think… I think, frankly, they’re not going to cover it well, no matter what. But we did a hell of a job.

And then compare us to Europe, and we did very well. But now that Europe is exploding again, they don’t want to talk about it, and neither do I because I want Europe to heal. I want the whole world to heal. But we’ve done a hell of a job except in public relations, and that’s explaining it to people. On that I give us a D, but we got an A+ in terms of what we’ve done.

Through Operation Warp Speed, we will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time by the end of the year and it could be sooner than that. But we have the greatest labs, the greatest companies of that kind in the world. And they are right there. They are right there. It’s going to be incredible. So it’s going to be a great vaccine. We have Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna. Another one just announced today. These are great, great, great companies.

On November 3rd, Virginia will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recovery, delay the vaccine, impose a $4 trillion tax cycle. That’s what he wants to do. Ban American energy. He wants to ban fracking. How about that? He wants to ban fracking. Then he locks into the nomination. You know, he shouldn’t have gotten it, because if Pocahontas left two days early, Bernie would have won. And we would have had Bernie. I don’t know who I would have been better against. Maybe, who knows? But we would have had radical Bernie. But we’re going to get a lot of Bernie votes like we did last night because his people agree with us on trade, except we’re better at it than he is.

So we’re going to get a lot of the Bernie votes. Boy, Bernie takes a hard shot does he? It is this twice it happened. And he has such a nice attitude, between him. And how about Bloomberg? Bloomberg gets absolutely decimated in the debate, right? Mini Mike, mini Mike. Mini Mike, he gets decimated and in order to get back with the Democrat party, “I’m going to put a hundred million dollars into Florida.” If I were him, I’d just take a pass. He doesn’t have to give us anything. We don’t need his money. Just take a pass. You know? So he wants to buy his way into the Democrats. And so he’s going down to Florida. It’s real.

But unfortunately this time that wasn’t so good, right? He said, “I’m going to pay off all these fines of the prisoners.” There’s only one problem. It’s illegal. Now he’s got himself a problem. Now he’s got himself a bigger problem than he had when Pocahontas beat the hell out of him in the debate. Oh that wasn’t so easy, Mike. Remember she was going point, after point, after point. And he thought she was talking about me. And so did I actually. And then, and then what happened? She said, “And I’m not talking about President Trump. I’m talking about you.” And he went, “Oh my God.” He’s not a good guy. He’s not a good guy. Stupid. To do that, stupid. You have to have some pride. You can’t go… But the way they treated him so badly, you can’t do that.

But they’re going to destroy the suburbs. You know, I keep hearing about suburban women like you, right? Suburban women. Well, I just ended a regulation that would have allowed projects in your… Do you mind having a project next to your house, your beautiful? You live in a beautiful house, right? Happily married, beautiful kids, everything perfect. The American dream, right? Do you mind having a project built next door? Yeah. She said she minds. Do you know who minds? Everybody minds. I just don’t think anybody knows that we did this. I really don’t. I don’t think anybody knows. And they’re going to change the zoning that allows them to build projects in the suburbs.

So the guys came to me. I said, “I want to end that.” They came, “Sir, we’re all set. We’re going to really bring it back.” I said, “No, I didn’t say bring it back. I said I wanted to end it.” “Well, that’s not so easy.” I said, “I want it ended. I don’t want it. I don’t want it.” And we terminated it so you can live happily ever after, if you vote for Trump. If you don’t vote for Trump, you can forget it because they will put… Do you know who’s in charge of it? Cory Booker, Senator Cory Booker. He’s another beauty.
Cory Booker, Senator Cory Booker, he’s another beauty. He was Elizabeth… If you really think, you had Elizabeth Warren, you had Cory Booker and you had Kamala. You know if you pronounce her name wrong, she goes crazy. Kamala, like a comma. It’s like a comma. She’s like a comma. And by the way, nobody treated sleepy Joe worse than his vice presidential pick. I brilliantly said, “He’ll never pick Kamala because he got called a racist. He got called xenophobic,” which he didn’t know what that meant. He got called all sorts of things, right? And so I said, “Now, obviously he’s not going to…” He picked her. I couldn’t believe it, but I think that’s good. We like our Mike Pence. We like Mike Pence.

And she’s rated further left than Bernie Sanders. I thought he was the most left in the… He’s not actually even in the party. He’s sort of like an Independent. Nobody ever used to say that, but he’s like an Independent. But she’s rated further left than crazy Bernie, and this is what you want? I don’t think so. Just so you understand… And then she calls it the Harris administration along with… Just like you’re naming a movie, the producing credits, right? “In the Harris administration along with Vice President Biden…” No, no, no. He’s heading up the ticket, but then he said the same thing. He put her name first. I’ve never done that. I love Mike, but I’ve never said, “Mike Pence and Donald Trump.” I always say Trump, because you know what? You got to know that you’re the president. He doesn’t know that he’s in first position. He doesn’t know it. He doesn’t know it. He forgot. He forgot.

Hey, look, you’re entitled to a mistake every once in a while. It was strange that they did it almost in the same hour, though, right? It was like one on top of another. Give free healthcare, they want to give free healthcare to illegal aliens and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in school. We don’t like that. To combat the toxic, and you see what it is, it’s toxic, left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we’re getting better, better, better all the time. And we’re joined tonight by a friend of ours, a warrior, Congressman Rob Wittman. Where’s Rob? Thanks, Rob. Good guy.
 Virginia Republican party chair, Rich Anderson. Good job. How are doing? Am I making the right move? I’m not wasting my time here, Rich? I got to ask him. Rich, what do you think? I think so, right? I think so. And congressional candidates, Nick Freitas. Oh, look at him. We had a call the other day, a very successful call, right? Great call. Thanks Nick. And a real warrior, a real hero, Scott Taylor. Scott, great job. Those are two very important races and I think you’re going to win them. I saw some good polling. We’re taking over the House from crazy Nancy. We’re going to have it. And I think those two guys, I think they’re going to win.

Also, somebody that I have heard incredible things about, the Republican nominee for the US Senate, Daniel Gade, Daniel Gade. He’s a good looking guy. [ 00:46:11] And I’ll tell you, he’s got to beat his opponent because he is just… Warner was, you know he was talking about Russia, right? Trump and Russia, Russia, Russia. Then he gets scammed by a guy with the greatest Russian accent. You remember that, right? “I have pictures of President Trump.” “Oh really? Where, where, where? What are they like? Are they nude pictures?” “Yes, yes, yes.” “Does Vladimir know?” “Yes, yes, yes.” So he’s talking to this guy, he got scammed, okay? It was a comedian or something. It was a comedian, he’s allowed to talk to Russians. If I talk to a Russian, it’s a terrible thing.

By the way, getting along with Russia is not the worst thing in the world. Does that make sense? Getting along with North Korea, Kim Jong-un. Everyone said, “Oh, he’s getting along. He’s giving so much.” I said, “What did he give?” They couldn’t tell me anything. You know what I gave? Sanctions, that’s what I gave. But you know what? We get along. We get along. You would have been in a war right now. It would have been a nuclear war. You would have been a war right now with North Korea if it wasn’t for me. Hillary Clinton didn’t have a clue. Obama didn’t have a clue. Obama told me when I sat with him, the one time I sat with him, “What’s your biggest problem?” “North Korea.” I said, “How big?” He said, “It’s a big problem.” And he was indicating like it was a war. I said, “Have you tried calling him? Have you tried? Have you given it a little shot? Instead of losing 10 million people.”

They used to say, “50,000 people could be killed.” No, 20 million people could be killed, okay? 20 million. Seoul is right near the border. It would be too bad, but we have a good relationship. I get criticized, because have relationships with these people and that’s a positive thing. We have to remember, that’s a positive thing. And I had a very good relationship in China with President Xi, but you know what? This pandemic has just… We made a great trade deal, but it just doesn’t mean the same to me. Does that make any sense? It doesn’t mean the same to me. It doesn’t mean the same to me. Last week, two weeks ago, they had the largest order of corn to our farmers in our history. They had the largest order of soybeans. They had this massive order of beef. But you know what? It just doesn’t mean as much to me now, as it did at one point. The ink wasn’t even dry on the trade deal, and this thing came in and they could have stopped it.

We’re all so deeply moved to be joined by two gold star spouses, two incredible people. Karen Owens was a guest at my first address to Congress, as we honored the supreme sacrifice of her husband, fallen Navy Seal, Ryan Owens. Where is Karen? Where are you? Come on up here, come up. And we’re also joined with Brittany Jacobson, her family. You know Brittany. On Memorial day in 2017, I met Brittany and her son, Christian, at Arlington national cemetery. And we honored the memory of her incredible husband and Christian’s dad, Marine Sergeant Christopher Jacobs. We took a picture together, that little boy, who’s no longer a little boy, Come on over here, come on. Come on over here, the both of you. Come on. [ 00:49:46]. [ 00:49:42] Thank you very much. I said, “How’s your beautiful, handsome boy?” She said, “Really good, but he wants to go back to school.” Let’s go, open up the schools, open up the schools governor. We’ll get them open.
 But we thank God every day for our courageous warriors, and we’ll always support our incredible gold star families. And we want to thank both of you. It’s incredible, thank you. And we’ll get you back to school soon, all right? Get them back. Come on, governor. Let’s go. You got other things to do. These people, they’re keeping this stage close, because they think it’s going to be harmful on November 3rd. And it’s not really, it’s not going to have too much of an impact. What it’s doing is hurting a lot of people though. It’s hurting a lot of people. In everything we do, we are putting America first. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the terrible damage Joe Biden and his friends inflicted on this country over the last 47 years. I love it when he says, “We could have done this. We should have done that.”

That guy’s been here forever. 47 years, hard to believe, right? And that was in primetime. Although, he’d never had super primetime. But that was in primetime, remember? And this time, and now I got him here, [ay ya yai 00:09:41]. Together we’ve taken on a corrupt and broken system, that’s been throwing everything at us from the very beginning. A new trove of documents… And you have to go home, you’ve got to read these documents. And they now prove that Russia interfered in 2016. Unfortunately, it was on behalf of Hillary Clinton, not Trump. They interfered, disinformation. Newly released text messages make 100% clear the FBI knew that Democrats purchased Russian disinformation targeting me, your favorite president, which then formed the basis for the witch hunt. And I’ll tell you, we’ve had some incredible strength in terms of people like Sean Hannity, the great Lou Dobbs. No, think of it. Laura, Tucker. Tucker’s been great the last period of time.

Fox and Friends, Jeanine, Jeanine. I’ll tell you. [Jesse 00:10:49], how about Jesse, huh? Hey, Greg Gutfeld was bad to me. Now, he’s great to me. He said, “Hey, would you rather have a nice guy that doesn’t do anything, or a horrible human being like Trump that gets it done?” They all say, “I’d rather have the horrible human.” I’m not a horrible human. I’m a nicer guy. I always get very offended when they say about like, “Well, maybe people don’t like him, but he gets everything done.” I think people like me, but I do get it done. [ 00:53:17]. Done more than any administration ever, in three and a half years, first three and a half years.
That’s so nice.
I’ll tell you, that is so nice. That is so nice. The first is just talking about the seating, we’re going to… Don’t worry about… The justice will get her seat, don’t worry about that. And that’s a nice, that’s nice. But you know they say, these people said, they’ve never heard a political campaign were a big audience says, “We love Trump,” or the candidate. I’ve never heard it. I’ve never heard it. It’s true. I’ve never heard it for Ronald Reagan. And I like Ronald Reagan, but I’ve never heard it. And they’ve never heard it. Nobody’s ever heard it. Who says that? But I love you too, I really do. I do. And we’re getting it done. No, they’ve never heard that chant. I’ve never heard it. And it started about two weeks ago and never heard it even before. But again, before-
No, I want to thank you. It’s really nice.
It’s really nice.
And we’ve got to go out and we’ve got to really work hard. And we’ve got to watch this ballot scam, because they’re scamming us, okay? They’re scamming us. And then they say, “He doesn’t want to turn over…” Of course, I do, but it’s got to be a fair election. See, that’s another scam. They don’t mention anything about ballots. I say, “Got to be a fair election.” When they’re losing ballots all over the place, when they’re losing ballots that just happened to be Trump ballots. You know, in Virginia, did you hear? In a very Democrat area, they sent two ballots to thousands of people, a thousand or thousands of people. It just came out over the wires. So people in a Democrat area got two ballots instead of one.

They had eight ballots in a wastepaper basket, military ballots, that all were for Trump. Every one was for Trump and they were in a wastepaper basket. They were thrown away and somebody saw them. Then they had many, many ballots thrown into a river, someplace, I don’t even know the state. These are just a few of them. And then go back earlier, go back to the Democrat primaries, go back to the great State, Iowa. I love Iowa. We’re going to win Iowa big, big, big, big. We won it last time by 11 points. We’re going to win it big. With ethanol, what I’ve done for them, with the $28 billion for the farmers. And that includes you, that includes tobacco, that includes a lot of things, but that includes your farmers. But you go back to their primaries, right? Go back to the primary, the Iowa, the first primary, it was done with ballots. They have no idea. Remember the disaster? And that’s a small primary.

Now, they’re talking about tens of millions of these fake ballots going all over the place. Who’s sending them? Where are they being sent? Who’s sending them back? Supposing they don’t get them, are they being sent to Democrat areas? And they’re all run by Democrat governors, right? All of them, 100%. It’s 100%. So you have a guy in Nevada, he just comes up with the idea. I think we’re going to win Nevada. If fairly, we’re going to win it. But he comes up, “Well, you don’t have to have your signature verified.” Oh, that’s nice. That’s good. He decided let’s do that. But you know a real big problem? I like watching television and have, “The winner is…” Right? You might not hear it for months, because this is a mess. Go back and study what happened in Iowa. Take a look, take a look at what happened in New York, in a small congressional race, Carolyn Maloney.

She should have lost the race, in my opinion. They gave it to her, because it was a crooked deal. The guy that she ran against was having fits. He said, “What are you doing? What are you doing?” Everything was mixed up. The ballots were lost. There was fraud. There was everything. Go into Patterson, New Jersey… These are just recently. It’s a disaster waiting to happen. And the only one that knows it better than we do are the Democrats. They know this is going to happen. They want it to happen, because they want to go through a court system. And instead, you’re not going to hear, very unlikely that you’re going to hear a winner that night. I could be leading and then they’ll just keep getting ballots and ballots and ballots and ballots. Because now, they’re saying that the ballots can come in late. Well, what does that mean? And more importantly, they’re going to be given, in some cases, a week or two weeks to count the ballots. So if we’re waiting for one state…

No, think of it. If we’re waiting… And this is, they’re talking about five, six, seven states that have this problem. So if we’re waiting for one state, does that mean the whole nation, the whole world, is going to wait for one state? I won’t use any names, but you have Pennsylvania, where you have a Democrat, who by the way, lost the case last week. We sued. We want him to open up his state and we won, on constitutional grounds. North Carolina, they have the state all locked up. So we’re talking about, these are the governors that run their states for Democrats. They really do. I mean, they run them, they’re Democrat governors, and they’re in charge of the count. We went to Nevada to make a speech. We had five different sites. The governor made it impossible, so we ended up at a different site. We had to get one very… This is the guy that’s in charge of ballots. He was a political hack. Now, he’s the governor. And this guy is in charge of ballots.

It’s not going to work. It’s going to be a disaster. And I want a smooth, beautiful transition, but they don’t add the other part, but it’s got to be an honest vote. And everybody knows, just go back again, look at Iowa, look what happened. Just take a look at that. They still don’t know who won. They didn’t know weeks later. Remember New Hampshire went, New Hampshire, declared a winner. And essentially, they don’t know what happened in Iowa. Except the difference is, we’re doing the same thing, but with tens of millions of ballots. This is a disaster waiting to happen and they shouldn’t let this system go. If you ask for a ballot, it’s called solicited. You solicit. You want the ballot, it comes in, you sign it, you send it back. That’s okay. But where they send millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, people get ballots, they didn’t even know they were getting them. Sign it, sign it. Then they have people going around getting them to sign. When you have that, you don’t need… We have much more enthusiasm. We’re so high up on enthusiasm, right?

But it’s very unfair, because when you have somebody go knock on your door, “Sign,” it’s called harvesting. They’re going to harvest ballots. Even though in some cases, in most cases, it’s illegal. It’s illegal as hell. And it should be illegal. So this is a disaster waiting to happen. And the only hope we have, really, other than going through a long, unbelievable litigation at the end, after it’s over, because we’re going to win. We’re not going to lose this, except if they cheat. That’s the way I look at it. We can’t let them cheat. We can’t let them, it’s too much. Our country is at stake and it’s true. Our country is at stake, because these people will destroy our country. We can’t let this happen. And this is a scam. They know it. The media knows it, but the media doesn’t want to cover it. They know exactly what’s going to happen and so do I, but the Democrats know better than all of us what’s going to happen.

So we can’t let it, and if you see anything, you just have to report it on everything. We’re all watching. Law enforcement’s watching all over the place, but it’s very hard to watch. Millions of ballots, very hard to watch. And that’s the only way we’re going to lose, is if there’s mischief. Mischief, and it’ll have to be on a big scale, so be careful. And we do want a very friendly transition, but we don’t want to be cheated and be stupid and say, “Oh, let’s…” We’ll go and we’ll do a transition and we know that there were thousands and thousands of ballots that made the difference through cheating. We’re not going to stand for it. We’re not going to stand for it. So just remember, keep your eyes open. For decades, our opponents spent trillions of dollars rebuilding other countries and now we’re finally rebuilding our country. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the Armed Forces, think of that, since the Air Force, 75 years ago. It’s called Space Force and it’s a big deal. See, that alone would be a big deal for… Honestly, that alone would be a very big deal for an administration. We did… Think of it. We now have a 6th branch of the United States Armed Forces. That’s a big deal. But we did so much more, so much more. I mean, think of it. It’s incredible. You know what we did, probably the most? We’ll have maybe even more than 300 federal judges, including court of appeals. And now we’re going to have three Supreme Court judges. Their minds are blowing, their mind. You’ve had many presidents, never had one Supreme court judge…

You’ve had many presidents never had one Supreme Court judge. We’re going to have three. Of all people! And that’s a record. Of all people to get three Supreme Court justices in one administration, in one term, they are going crazy. They’re saying, “Darling, tell me this is not happening.” But you’ll see it tomorrow at 5:00. With the help of the incredible workers of Newport News and Norfolk Naval Shipyard, we will build 355. We’re going to have a Navy again, of 355 ships. That’s what we need. That’s been depleted. And they’re already being built. We’ve got a few big ones, beauties being built, including aircraft carriers.

Biden will slash military funding, and shipbuilding will be shut down. It’s going to be shut down like it used to be. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and mass murderer, Soleimani. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear catastrophe. What a deal that was. $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. You ever see what 1.8 billion in cash? It’s plane loads. These guys over there, they must’ve said, “What the hell is this?” They never saw money like that. We paid it. You know what we got for it? Nothing. Nothing.

I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’d been working on that for 52 years. I got it done quickly. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace in the middle East. We even got nominated, right? You know what for? That’s all right. I hate to talk about it, but I have to because the press doesn’t talk about it. No, it was a great honor. It was a great honor. Twice. You know that, right? Twice? The press doesn’t talk about it. The Nobel Peace Prize, huh? Two for different things. For Kosovo and Serbia. We stopped them from killing each other. It was very nice, and they don’t have to kill each other. Been killing each other for a long time. Kosovo, Serbia. It was great. It was great. And we got a nomination for Israel, and you look at Bahrain, UAE. That’s just the beginning. We have them lined up that want to go into that. Well, peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand.

And I told you. You heard the story. I went home. I said, “First Lady, I’m going to get the greatest stories tonight. I just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, First Lady.” The Israel, everybody said it couldn’t be done. And they were right. It couldn’t be done the way they were doing it. You would have never gotten it done. The way John Kerry was doing it, you would have never gotten it done. That’s a guy that doesn’t have a clue, incompetent. But you know what? I said, “First Lady, wait till you see this. It’s going to be unbelievable.” And we watched Lester Holt. I don’t even know why. And we had one story after another after another, and after seven stories, I said, “First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing.” And they never mentioned it, nor did any other of the newscasts. Fake CNN didn’t mention it. MSDNC didn’t mention it. ABC, CBS. Nobody mentioned it. So I was very embarrassed.

Three days later, I got nominated again. And I said, “My great First Lady, we got another shot at it, darling. Let’s watch the news tonight.” One story, two stories, three stories, four stories, five stories. We got to the end. It wasn’t mentioned again. And when Barack Hussein Obama was nominated, it was. And he didn’t know what he got it for. He still doesn’t. He doesn’t know what he got it for. So we have a little double standard going on, but that’s okay. As long as we know. Sometimes I’ll be talking that way and I’ll look around, I’ll say, “Oh, I’m in the Oval Office. Ha, ha. How did that happen?” I said, “You know, with all the complaining, we’re in the Oval Office, and they’re not, right?” And if you don’t mind, let’s keep it that way, so we can keep this going.

We’ve achieved more in 47 months than Joe Biden has achieved in 47 years. It’s true. Biden, without even knowing it, is pushing the most far left platform in history. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protection for people with pre-existing conditions. He would terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. You know, I got the travel ban. Remember? Everyone said you couldn’t do that. I want a travel ban from people that want to blow up our country. Do you think that’s okay?

People said, “Oh, we don’t like that.” Took a little heat, and we got it. They said I didn’t get it. And they were right. We lost at one court, lost at the second, and then we won in the Supreme Court. They don’t say that. But we have a strong travel ban, and we will use it. We do use it. We use it plenty. And increase refugee admissions. They want to increase refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates for radical Islamic terrorism. They want to ban school choice and charter schools. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. Every parent. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s so true. And in conclusion, I love you people, but I’ve been doing this since early in the morning. I’m getting the hell out of here. I would only do this for Virginia. I got a guy, he stays in his damn basement all day long, and I’m doing this. I don’t know, if he wins, I’m going to be very embarrassed. I’ll say, “Gee, I worked so hard, and he didn’t work at all.” Nah, we’re going to win. I think we’re going to win, and I think we’re going to win big. I think we’re going to. I think we’re going to win bigger than anyone understands.

I think there’s a vote out there, there’s a hidden vote out there. The pollsters are fake. They’re controlled by the same people that write the bad stories, the fake stories. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Ban them.

We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, Virginia. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of the ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars, countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will keep you out of them. And by the way, we have weapons the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. We have a level of, a degree of which nobody, from Russia to China to North Korea, nobody’s ever seen what we’ve built, and just hope to God we never have to use them. But we have never had anything like the arsenal that we’ve built over the last three years. Hope to God, we never have to use them.

We’re the envy of the world in that way. We have the greatest people for building this. Nobody can do what we can do. There’s nobody. But when I came in, your military was totally depleted. You had old planes. You had old everything. We have, now, the F-35s, and we have things, the bombers, the new bombers, the tankers, the ships that we’re building, some right here, Newport News. Yeah. But we have built an arsenal, the likes of which the world has never seen. And you know what? That will make it a lot easier for us not to have to use them. That’s really what we need. We needed it. We were in bad shape. We were in bad shape. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. And that’s what we’ve done.

We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance. You know the health insurance is a disaster. And we are bringing the price of health insurance way down. Premiums and costs of prescription drugs, we’re instituting favored nations. We pay the highest in the world for drugs. I negotiated with big pharma, and I just got tired of negotiating. I said, “I’m sorry. We’re instituting favored nations. We’re the largest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world.” And I instituted what we call a favored nations clause, where we will pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price in the world. In addition to that, I instituted a rebate clause, where we get the rebates instead of the middlemen. These are the richest people. I don’t know who the hell they are, but the middlemen are very rich, and they’re not liking me too much, and you’re going to see a lot of bad ads from big pharma. They’ve already started. Just remember every time you see one of those ads, that means your drug prices are coming way down. And I mean by 50, 60, 70, and 80%.

We’ll strongly protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. Always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We’re happening quickly. And we’ve taken NASA from fairways … I mean, you have to see. They had fairways along like a golf course. It was a better golf course than it was a runway. And what we’ve done, we’ve taken all the grass out. It was grass blowing right through the cracks. It was a disgrace. And we’ve now made it the number one space center in the world by far, again. You ought to see this. They were playing golf. They were playing golf. It was all closed up, or essentially closed up. It was actually worse than closed up. You know what? It was sort of open, but nobody was doing anything. They had nothing to do.

We have the greatest scientists in the world, and we’re letting rich guys send up rockets. We like it. Somehow, rich people like to send rockets up. We say, just pay us a nice rent and have a lot of fun sending your rockets up. But NASA is now number one in the world, again, by far, and there’s no contest. And all that grass is gone.

We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Are you listening, NFL? Are you listening, NFL? And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God We Trust.”

For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Virginia and North Carolina. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. There’s never been a more important election than this election. Early voting has already begun. Do not wait. Go out and vote. From Richmond to Roanoke, from Fredericksburg to Williamsburg, and from Norfolk to right here in Newport News, we stand on the shoulders of Virginia patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. Virginia is the place that gave us George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe. Now, you know, I signed a little document, 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or a monument.

It’s amazing how you haven’t seen any of that lately. They were having a little fun, and now they were heading toward the Jefferson Memorial. I said, “Wait a minute.” And I predicted that. They were knocking down statues. A lot of people didn’t know exactly which one. I said, “You better stop it because the next thing you know, they’ll knock down the statue of Robert E. Lee. And they did.” I said, “You better stop it, or they’ll be going after Thomas Jefferson and Washington and Abe Lincoln.” And they started.

And I said, “What are we going to do here? I have some good people.” They said, because today in Congress you can’t get anything done. They’d give you one day in a very nice hotel. So I said, “What are we going to do?” They said, “We’ll take out an old law, and you can re-institute it with an executive order.” I said, “What does it say?” 10 years in prison, not jail. They used the word prison. I said, “For what?” You knock down a monument or a statue, you go to jail for 10 years. I said, “Give me that, then get it to my office.” And I signed it, and they were coming down to Washington. They were going to knock down two particular statutes that were really beautiful. And I signed it, and we announced it, had a news conference, got to let people know about it. Right? And the 20,000 person march turned out to be about three people, and two of them were arrested, actually, because we have … Thanks to the fake news, we have a lot of footage of people standing on the statue of Jackson, Andrew Jackson.

Remember? They almost had the ropes. We sent in the police. The police did a great job, by the way. Remember that? The ropes, they’re ready to pull it down. And we said charge. And they charged. And I want to tell you, they did a hell of a job. They were much tougher than the people with the ropes. It took them about two minutes, and that was the end of the ropes. But it was close. They got there just in time. But you know what? Since I signed that, there’s been no statues, no monuments that have been played with. Federal, federal. States have to do the same thing for their states. Virginia heroes made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Going to win, win, win. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of Virginia and North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Virginia. Thank you. Get out and vote. Thank you.",26/9/20
"Well, we won Pennsylvania last time and we’re going to win it by a lot more this time I can see. Because four years ago we had a lot of enthusiasm, but we have more now. Even the fake news will admit that. They [ 00:00:23]. There’s more than we’ve ever had.
 
Hello Pennsylvania. Thank you very much for being here in the rain. As we stand together in the rain, it’s supposed to bring luck and we’ll take it. Ah, my man. I just came from the Rose Garden of the White House. Thank you very much, and I love you too. I do. Thank you. Or I wouldn’t have done this. I wouldn’t have done it.

But we’re doing well. Our country’s going to be stronger than ever before very soon. You watch. It’s happening. It’s all happening beautifully. It’s happening. We had to close it down. We saved millions of lives. We opened it up and we’re doing record kind of numbers, and we’re going to have the best year and we’re going to have a great third quarter, so thank you very much.

I’ve just come from the Rose Garden of the White House, where I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a brilliant legal mind, an extraordinary scholar. You know that. Number one in her class. You know the professor, one of the most respected people, he said the greatest student he’s ever had. That’s pretty good. That’s a little better than Biden, wouldn’t you say? She should be running for president instead of …

Now it’s a little bit better, academically, slightly better. Most important of all, she will defend your God-given rights and freedoms. She will. Judge Barrett would become the third Supreme Court justice along with over 300 … think of this. This is our third domination. We have Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and now we have Amy, along with over 300 federal judges by the end of this term. We’ve confirmed to uphold our laws and constitution as written, and that’s a record.

Joe Biden has refused to provide his list because the names will be handpicked by socialists like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC plus three and Ilhan Omar. That’s a great one. She’s a great one. Always complaining. She’s always complaining. Came here, things worked out for her. How did she come here? Does anybody know how she came here? AOC plus three. That’s a beauty. That’s a group of real … They love our country so much.

They’ve given power. The far left will pack the Supreme Court with radicals who will terminate the second amendment. That’s what they want to do, strike the words under God from your Pledge of Allegiance, tear down crosses from public spaces and force taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion. That’s what they’re looking to do.

These left-wing justices will cripple police departments, protect sanctuary cities and declare the death penalty unconstitutional for even the most depraved mass murders. It’s unconstitutional. We will save your second amendment and together we will save our country, and that’s what we’re doing.
That’s a lot of people. We have tens of thousands of people. If sleepy Joe came here, I really mean this, you know the little circles he fills and he can’t get them full? You have like five of them, those circles, those big beautiful … Whoever does it does a nice job. They’re very round. But he’s got five of them and then he stands very far back and walks in. I mean, I don’t get the whole deal there. I don’t get it.

We have tens of thousands. Somebody said 17, 18,000. Last night we had 35,000 people. You saw that in Virginia. We’re making a play for Virginia because we have a governor in Virginia, you know that, he wants to totally end … All he does is talk about terminating the second amendment. That’s all he talks about. That’s all he talks about. In 38 days, we will win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We will win four more years in the White House. Right? Thank you.
Thank you very much. Great honor. It’s a great honor. We’ve achieved a lot together. It’s together is what happened. Wait’ll you see the numbers on November 3rd. Get out and vote. Go early vote. Do whatever you have to do. Make sure they don’t cheat you too badly with those ballots.

Did you see today? There was a big mishap with the ballots. Another one. This is every day they have that, Mike. Every day, big mishap with the ballots. One of them, New York has said, “Well, we’re going to change the system a little bit.” It’s a little late for doing that, isn’t it? New York wants to change their system. They’re going to work on something. Governor Cuomo, he’s going to work on something now. Well, the ballots are flowing. It’s a little late.

Then in a certain location, you know the location, they mailed a thousand ballots out. Unfortunately they doubled it up and everybody in this Democrat area got two ballots instead of one. Then two days ago they found eight ballots in a wastepaper basket. Unfortunately, they all had the name Trump written on them. We were going to vote for Trump. They were military ballots, the military.

Then they have a stream in a very good state and they found lots of ballots dumped in this stream. Look, look, this is not right. What they’re doing is not right. It’s all run by these ballots, the ones we’re talking about, whether it’s Pennsylvania, because we’re going to win in Pennsylvania. You got to watch, but you have a governor who’s in charge of ballots.

North Carolina, Michigan, Nevada, all of these places, they’re all run by Democrats. They’re the ones that count the ballots. Does anybody have even a doubt? It’s just common sense. It’s common sense. We’re going to be very careful. We’re going to watch. You know we’re waiting for rulings from a great federal judge in your state, federal judge, about the constitutionality of the whole thing. They’re going to try and steal the election. Look at this crap. The only way they can win Pennsylvania, frankly, is to cheat on the ballots. That’s the way I look at it. That’s the way I look at it.

They just had a big thing today. They said there was a mistake made on a lot of the ballots. They’re going to try and redo the system. Take a look at Iowa during the primary. Remember the first primary? They couldn’t do anything. It was all a mess. It was all a mess. Good job. Good job. Look at this guy. Good job. Good job. Hey, good job.
That guy, he’s going home to his parents now. He’s going to be in big trouble. But wait a minute, wait, wait. He just opened his mouth and we had that gentleman in the beautiful blue … Will you stand up? Stand up. Man. Are you in law enforcement because you were on him. This guy hadn’t gotten the first word out. That’s the kind of guy I want working for me right there. Man, great. That was just instinct. That’s called natural instinct. Some people have it and some people don’t. Unfortunately, most people don’t. That’s the problem.

Under my administration, we proudly achieved energy independence. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Sleepy Joe Biden has vowed to ban fracking. That’s not good for Pennsylvania. You notice now he’s trying to pull back?

He went to a place called Texas, no oil, no God and no guns in Texas. That doesn’t work. But you know what? Doesn’t work here either. You’re a big fracker. It’s a big business here, 900,000 jobs, but he wants to eradicate all of the things that you’re doing, all of the things that are bringing in so much money for your state. It’s a disgrace. Now he’s trying to say, “Well, I didn’t really mean that.”

That was like Hillary. Remember? She made a horrible statement about clean coal and then she went, crooked Hillary, and then she went three weeks later … I agree.

All right. I used to say, “Now, now, now, we won, we won. Now, don’t do it.” But didn’t say [ 00:11:11], but I try and stop it. But now I, she’s crazy. Bill is stone cold afraid of her. No, but how about remember the emails? You think we forgot? We didn’t forget the emails. You remember the emails when Congress said, “We want 33,000 emails,” and they deleted the emails? They deleted everything, the text messages, everything, they deleted. If Mike Kelly did that he’d be out of a job so fast. He’d be gone, right? He’d be gone. None of us, we wouldn’t last long. I mean the corruption.

Hey, did you see though, over the last 48 hours, the FBI tapes, the FBI text messages? Trump was right. The one guy says, “Trump was right. He was right. You shouldn’t be doing this. Trump was right.” He was the honest one. But they brought him along. We need insurance. We have to get insurance for this. This is wrong, what we’re doing. Trump was right.

It turned out that it was a whole big dis-information deal. You know who the guilty party is? The Democrats and Hillary, they were the ones that dealt with Russia. It wasn’t us, which we’ve been saying for a long time. No, these text messages just came out. Did you see that? They just came out.

We went through two and a half years of a lot of work and they ruined a lot of people. Look at General Flynn. Look at what happened. Those messages about General Flynn last night just came out. They knew he was innocent. They said, “We want Flynn in order to get Trump. We want Flynn.” They were after Trump. It came out loud and clear. They were after Trump.

I’ll tell you what, we got to get back to Congress and go after these people. These people are sick. They’re sick. It was a whole big con job with shifty Schiff and the whole group. Shifty Schiff, he gets up and says a totally different thing than what I said, totally different. They say, “Sir, you can’t go after him because he’s shielded because he made this speech.” He totally lied. He made it in Congress and he can say anything.

See, it shouldn’t be the opposite. When you’re in Congress, you should be more honest. What a sleazebag he is, right? He [ 00:13:40]. What a sleazebag he is. What a jerk. What a jerk. We got to deal with people like that. I’ll tell ya. I’ll tell ya. How do you come together with people like that, they’re totally dishonest, because I want the country to come together. We were coming together until we got hit with a plague from China. We were coming together. I was getting calls from stone, cold, radical left, hard line Democrats, let’s start talking. I’m telling you, because we had the best unemployment numbers we ever had, the best economy, best stock market, although the stock market right now is just about there.

Success will bring us together. Then we got hit with the plague from China and now we have to do it all over again. It’s make America great again again. That’s what we got to do. But we saved millions of lives by doing what we did.

When they ask about fracking, sleepy Joe Biden said that he would make sure it’s eliminated. This was just a little while ago. Then he gets the nomination, he goes, “Well, I didn’t think fracking’s that bad.” It’s amazing, isn’t it? That’s what you call a really dishonest, dumb politician. A dumb guy. He’s a dumb guy. Always known as the dumb guy.

But we look forward to seeing him in the debate. He’s got a lot more experience. He’s got 47 years. I’ve got three and a half years, so we’ll see. He’s got 47 years of experience. I always sort of smile when he said, like [ 00:15:18], “We should have done this. We should have done that. We should have,” all these things. I said, “Why didn’t you do them?” He’s been there for … It’s not like he left 20 years ago, 47 years and he left three and a half years ago. Why the hell didn’t you do them? Now he went, it’s all these great ideas. That’s a real beauty.

Days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions, which he doesn’t have any idea what that means, shutting down all fracking and sending you jobs overseas, like they’ve been doing. I’m bringing your jobs back. They’re all coming back. I’ll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong. That’s where they belong, what they’ve done to you and other States.

Joe Biden’s agenda would also be a nightmare for Pennsylvania seniors. Do we have any seniors here? Don’t raise your hand. Do we have any seniors? Look how few people raised their hands? I can see some seniors. We’re proud of it. Right?

For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know that. He wants to go … You know what’s going to happen. They’re going to go with socialized medicine if they ever got in.

Remember Obama, what he said? By the way, Obama knew all about the scam. He knew all about this coup. He knew all about spying on my campaign. He knew everything. Somebody said, “Well, we can’t go.” They have him [ 00:16:49], they have him Remember I said they were spying on my campaign a long time ago? The internet blew up. How dare he say that? It turned out to be true. Then it was the coup because I got in. Now they said, “All right, he got in. We couldn’t stop him. Now we’re going to try taking it away.” Can you believe it? This is the USA. No, seriously, can you believe it? We caught them. All these text messages, and from what I hear, they have some real beauties coming out over the next couple of days, so [ 00:17:27]. When somebody said, “Oh, you can’t do that. He was president.” Well I’m president too and they would not stop. I promise. These people are sick. They’re bad people.

Remember when Biden said, “When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security.” He meant this. He said, “When I argued,” and he wanted to freeze all this federal spending, he’s not going to take care of your Medicare. He’s not going to take care of your Social Security. If he gets in, he’s going to have nothing to say because the radical left will control it and he’s going to do socialized medicine, as sure as you’re sitting or standing there. I don’t, I can’t even tell the hell difference. You’re sitting.

Isn’t it nice we got seats for people? Who would do that? Look at all the police back there. Are they the greatest? Great guys. They’re great people. We got so many endorsements, I don’t even talk about them anymore. We have so many police endorsements. New York City’s finest, never did it before. They endorsed me. They endorsed us for president. They could solve that problem in New York. All they’d have to do is let them do …

They could solve that problem in New York. All they’d have to do is let them do their job and don’t take a billion dollars away and fire some of the best people on the force, which is what they did. We got Chicago. Think of that. Chicago police endorse me. How about that? This is not easy to do. You’re dealing with radical left people. We got endorsed by all the sheriffs in Florida, all law enforcement in Florida. We got endorsed by Texas, Oklahoma. We got endorsed by… Does anybody know of any police area or group that has not endorsed us? We’re looking for them. We’re looking.

Now Biden is pledging to give federal healthcare to illegal aliens, which is decimating. Medicare. Just saying this, that we all have heart. We want to help people. But the problem is when you say that, people that never even thought of coming to the United States say, “Let’s go.” “Where are we going?” We get free education. We get free Medicare free healthcare. And then I jokingly said, one time, “Everybody gets a beautiful brand new Rolls Royce.” And CNN said, “He lied. He said that all illegal immigrants got a $750,000 car.” It’s true. They said he lied. I didn’t. I was only kidding. They said I lied over the Rolls Royce. You remember when I said, “Russia, if you’re listening, find her emails.” Or whatever the hell I said. “Find her emails.” And then we all laughed together. 25,000 people in the stadium on television. Look at all the cameras on television. Look at those people. Look at all those red lights that are going on. They’re standing in the rain just like I am, but they don’t like it. But do you remember? But the problem is they cut it off exactly before we all started to laugh together. Right? And for two years they’ve been saying, “He dealt with Russia. He asked Russia to please get her emails.” Or whatever the hell we were asking for “Russia, if you’re listening, please get…” The whole place cracks up along with me. In fact, they cut off my last word. You know, they got to cut it short because they don’t want to see any sign.

This is how dishonest. They are really, I’ll tell you, they’re so bad for the country. But I’ll take it back for right now. Because right now it’s live all over the place. We’ll let it go. You know what? Let’s say it at the end instead. Because so often I’ll say, “You know, they’re CNN, they’re totally corrupt. They’re fake.” And you see the light go off there, the red light. I said, “I got to stop saying that.” Do you think it’s wet enough out here? They all said, “Sir, would you need a hat?” I said, “What the hell hat is going to match this beautiful tie that I’ve just…” I got a red one. I don’t know, red and whatever the hell color this is. Red is not going to go well with this color. Nah, it’s fine. I like seeing the rain with my friends from Pennsylvania. I don’t care. We’re in the rain together. We’re in the rain together.

Thank you. Thank you very much. We’re in the rain together. That’s all right. We’ll stay out here all night if we have to, right? But I’ll tell you, so many interesting things are going on. When I look at their plans… Did you see their plans? The manifesto? That’s the Bernie Sanders and AOC manifesto. Normally when you negotiate with communists, because I don’t think it’s… Haven’t they gone over the… I don’t think it’s… This is no longer socialism. We’re dealing with worst than socialism. This is communism. But when you deal with socialist communists, you’re supposed to bring them a little bit to the right, right? You’re a Democrat, you bring… They started with a plan and they went further left. This plan is the most horrible. We call it the manifesto. Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. But you know the one thing they agree with us? On trade. Because we are being ripped off by so many countries. I’ve stopped a lot of it.

I mean, I had to devote a lot of time to a fake impeachment. Now you see how fake the impeachment was. What about Biden’s son getting three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow? And then they say, “Donald Trump is dealing with Russia. Donald Trump.” I never even made a call. “Donald Trump is dealing.” This guy got three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. What the hell was that for?

Probably his great experience in energy, but he didn’t have that. And then it revealed yesterday that he got a lot more money from China than we thought and he got a lot more money, right? It’s just all stuff. It’s like perfect. It’s like unbelievable. But he got a lot more money from China and the 100, the 83 or 63,000 a month that he was getting, now it looks like it was 183,000 a month. And he got an upfront payment of $3 million from Ukraine. This is because of his great knowledge of energy, but he had none. They said, “Do you know anything about energy?” “No, I don’t happen to know anything.” Oh. And then the father called for the prosecutor, “Get him out or you’re not getting your billion dollars from the United States.” Whoa. They got him out and here’s your billion. That’s not a quid pro quo. Right?

But a perfect phone call is a quid pro quo where nothing was… It’s a disgrace. Well, hopefully we’re getting to the bottom of all that stuff because we got plenty. Biden’s plan for mass amnesty would bankrupt your social security system. You remember me when I got elected, they all said, “Oh, he’s going to hurt…” They love to say that’s going to hurt because they give dis-information. They say a lie like the soldiers and the graves and they put it in. Can you imagine? No animal that I know would say that. Nobody. They make up a lie and then they go with it. Social security. They said four years ago. Now they said again. By the way, your social security, we never touched it. Not even touched it. They said he will destroy your social security. No. They will destroy it because they’ll destroy your country and your social security will be worthless. That’s what’s going to happen.

In just three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, obliterated 100% of the ISIS [ 00:07:07]. Fixed our disastrous trade deals and brought jobs back home to America and back home to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under 16 years of presidents, Obama and Bush, household income rose only $2,945. These are right out of the book. So 16 years, less than 3,000. In three years with us, it rose 6,483. So much less than half [ 00:07:42]. And if you include energy savings, how do you like paying those $2 for a gasoline and even less [ 00:26:51]? And your electric bill is way down.

We’re number one in the world. How do you like that? If you include that, it’s $10,000. That’s over three years, three and a half years. We lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, which is a wreck. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now we are very, very rapidly… You see the numbers. It’s happening all over again. We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. There’s never been a record like that. We’ve added more jobs than any time, four months, not even close. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II.

They said, “How did you do it?” I say we get an A plus, but I get a D in public relations because we were so busy working. When you give it to the fake news, they report it incorrectly. So I figured what’s the use of even dealing with it? We did a job, including ventilators that nobody had. We took over. The cupboards were bare when we took over. We pioneered life saving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Whoever heard of that? And Europe, which is having a big surge right now, they used to use Europe, “Oh, look how Europe is doing.” We’re doing well. We don’t want them to have a surge. Europe has had almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. You don’t want to hear that. They don’t want to tell you that. Early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through operation warp speed. We will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time.

We’re going to have it very, very soon. They’re very upset with the vaccine. They’re very upset with the vaccine because it’s happening too soon. They don’t want it now. Even though it’s saving lives, it’s going to save tremendous lives, they don’t want to hear it. They don’t want to hear about the therapies. They just want to get through the election. I heard one state… Did you hear this? We’re going to open up our schools on November 6th. Oh. I told you that, right? Don’t worry about it, Pennsylvania. Your state’s going to be open like on November 4th. This was some idiot. And now they’re excoriating this person that said it. They’re excoriating the person that said it. We’re to open up out of schools in November 6 to latest November 9th. Oh, that’s nice. Got to open your schools. You’ve got to open up your state. Open it up.

The ones that are doing well are the ones that opened it up. We will crush the virus. Our opponents will crush America. And that’s what it’s about. They will. They will deliver a crippling shutdown and a steep. You will have… If sleepy Joe Biden becomes president, first of all, you’re going to have a massive tax increase. You’re going to see interest rates go through the ceiling. You will have a depression, the likes of which this country has never seen before. And I’m including 1929. That was a pretty bad one. All right. That’s what’s going to happen. I hope I don’t get a chance to be tested because I don’t want to be tested. I don’t want to have him and say, “See, I was right.” Because with us, you’re going to have incredible prosperity. We’re cutting taxes and we’re growing fast.

I’m delivering a safe vaccine in record time. That’s the other thing with the vaccine because of me and the FAA, they’re approving things in a fraction of the time. You wouldn’t have had a vaccine if you had to go through that obsolete process. You wouldn’t have had a vaccine for two and a half more years. On November 3rd, Pennsylvania will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity. Or whether we allow to sleepy Joe Biden to kill the recovery, delay the vaccine, impose a $4 trillion tax hike, destroy your suburbs. Everyone is talking about me and the suburbs. I knocked out the regulation that allows low-income housing in the suburbs. Then I hear oh, the people in the suburbs don’t like me. You better like me because you’re going to have… Your suburbs aren’t going to be so great. They say that women in the suburbs… I made the mistake. I said, “Housewives living in the suburbs.” They said, “Oh, that’s politically incorrect.” Okay. I got killed for that. I used the word housewife. Is that an unacceptable term? I don’t know.

They’re all saying no. I said the housewives in the suburbs. And they said, “Oh, what a horrible thing to say.” But women, let’s be politically correct, women and men in the suburbs, they’re changing the zoning so they can build. That’s what it is. They’re changing the zoning. It was a rule, a regulation that was a disaster. I called my people. I said, “I want to terminate it.” They said, “Sir, we can’t do that. Let’s just amend it. We’ll make it much…” “No, no. You don’t understand. I don’t want to amend it. I want to terminate it.” “Yes, sir.” And we terminated it. We terminated it. But if you believe the fake suburb polls, I don’t think people in the suburbs know that I did that. I don’t think they know that I did it. They say, “We want sleepy Joe Biden.” Why? Why do you want him? First of all, you’re not getting him. You’re getting this maniac who was falling like a rock in the polls. He picked somebody that he should have never picked. She was so bad to him. She said such bad things about him. I’m not going to pick somebody that says bad. Then on top of it, 15, 14, 13, 10, eight, seven. Then she went up back to eight. She had a big week. And then she went back down. She got out at one or two. She quit before Iowa, right? Then they had the Iowa primary. Because they used these crazy ballots, nobody ever found out who won. And now they want to use it on a scale that’s a thousand times bigger. 80 million ballots. 80 million ballots.

They couldn’t count a small number, but now they’re counting. Then they had the race in New York, Carolyn Maloney, terrible, terrible Congresswoman. And they took it away from the guy that was beating her or would have beat her. But they’re missing massive. It sounded like they’re missing 1%, which would be unacceptable. 1%, you can win by 1%, right? You can win by 1/10 of 1%. But they’re losing… Like there was one area I think 41% of the ballots were missing. 41. These people are crazy. This is going to be a disaster. And all I’m asking is people go out to vote. Go out to vote and stop with this nonsense because we’re going to be counting ballots for the next two years.

I don’t want to end up in the Supreme Court, and I don’t want to go back to Congress either. Even though we have an advantage if we go back to Congress. Does everyone understand that? I think it’s 26 to 22 or something because it’s counted one vote per state. So we actually have an advantage. Oh, they’re going to be thrilled to hear that. I’m sure they’re trying to figure out how can we break that one? Biden wants to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in schools, right? To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We’ll teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. We are only getting better. We’re getting better. This is a healing for us. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. I’m telling you. I used to say like even a couple of months ago, well, how do you… Like 2016, that was pretty exciting. Right? Was that exciting? Was that the coolest night? Trump is winning Florida. He’s winning North Carolina. He’s winning Pennsylvania. He’s winning Michigan. He’s winning Wisconsin. He’s winning everything. What the hell is going on? And people crying. They’re crying. The anchors, the non-biased anchors are crying. I watched an interview with a person on MSBNC. I don’t watch it much, but I watched because sleepy Joe was on. She’s like, “Did you see that interview yesterday?” And she’s very tough. Very tough. She’s very nasty. She’s feeding him, can’t answer it. So what she’s doing is… “No, no, isn’t it true? Isn’t it true that Trump is a horrible human being?” Well, yeah. As we discussed before, it’s true. This was the worst, most obvious… And this was a killer. This person is very tough. It is so rigged. The whole thing is rigged. We got to beat the system, and we’re beating the system. Sometimes I’ll look and I’ll have somebody in the office that’s corrupt media person. And I’ll be sitting there complaining how unfair it is. Then I’ll be sitting in the Oval Office, but I’ll be saying how unfair it is. Then I’ll look around the Oval Office. I say, “Wait a minute. It’s unfair, but oh, we’re in the Oval Office and you’re not.” I stopped complaining, Mike. They said, “Oh, this is the Oval Office. Isn’t it?”

Joe Biden has surrendered his party to the flag burners, rioters, the anti-police radicals, the anarchists. His running mate urged supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out riders out of jail, including an attempted cop killer. Let’s get him out of jail. 13 members of Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. They donated a lot of money too. We want to get these people out. We want to be called in. You saw what we did in Minneapolis. She called us like a week and a half too late. We went in. How long did that take? About a half hour. It was over. We brought in the National Guard. We told Seattle we’re coming in and they left that night. We’re all set to go in. I was so disappointed. I was disappointed.

We were going to make a big statement, but we couldn’t because they said, “Okay.” They left. Shouldn’t have told them. Next time, don’t tell them. If you look at Portland, what a mess, right? That’s an anarchist. That’s sort of like a different… Chicago’s a mess. New York, what they’ve let happen to New York. And we have these great police in Chicago and New York. They can do the job. Just let them do the job. It’s terrible. But you look at-

The job, it’s terrible. But, you look at Portland. Portland is anarchist, and you had the guy two weeks ago, remember he shot and killed the young man in the middle of the street, just shot him like … Oh, I don’t want to even say like what because his parents are so devastated. A young man and they shot him and killed him, this one guy, this one animal. Two and a half … That’s right, over his hat. Not our hat, it was another hat, it was a Christian hat. It was a Christian hat, he was a Christian. He was a Christian, and they shot him, killed him instantly. This guy that shot him, everybody knew who he was, right? I said, after two days, “Where is he? Did you arrest him?” No, we didn’t. After two and a half days, “Did you arrest him?” Then I put out on social media, “Why didn’t you arrest him?”

You know what, the U.S. Marshal saw it. They went in, and he pulled a gun on them, and 15 minutes it was all over. None of our guys were hurt, and he was dead. This guy was a stone cold killer, and yet they say he was a protestor. He’s not a protestor, an anarchist and a killer, and the U.S. Marshals, thank you. That was an incredible job they did, brave. But the U.S. Marshals … We can solve that problem so easy, we’d put them in there so easy, but they don’t want, the governor doesn’t want them. The governor wants to leave it that way. Can you imagine what a messed up … But many, …

This is for years that’s been going on in Portland. I said, “What do the streets look like?” They said, “You wouldn’t believe it. People put up 2 x 4 Sill fronts. They don’t want to buy new because they know somebody’s going to knock them down within two weeks. It’s a terrible thing. The Democrat party’s war on cops is putting our police officers at risk. As president, I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. You see how much the people love you? They really do. You know, you don’t hear that. You don’t hear that, but the people love and respect the job you do. You know, you don’t hear it because these maniacs right back there, they don’t know what they’re writing. They do love you and respect you so much. So, thank you very much, thank you.

That’s why law enforcement organization around the country, all organizations, that’s why they’re endorsing me and strongly opposing my opponent, and the radical left. My opponent, again, is controlled like a puppet by these people, by these crazy people. I’m proud to have received the first-ever unanimous endorsement from the largest police union in the world, the Fraternal Order of Police. The largest in the world, and we’re joined tonight by their president. A fantastic guy, friend of mine, Pat Yoes, and several hundred of their brave officers. Pat, come on up. Come on up here, Pat.

Mr. President, thank you. You know, across this Nation there are some 800,000 police officers who put on a uniform every day, men and women who go into communities and place their own safety at risk to protect our communities across America. It seems like overnight people have turned their back on America’s law enforcement. We went from public servants to public enemies overnight because many politicians turned their back on us. You, Sir, have never turned your back on America’s law enforcement. So Sir, I am here to tell you that on behalf of America’s largest law enforcement organization, rank and file police organization, we give you our unanimous and enthusiastic endorsement, and we will not turn our back on you. Together we are going to make America safe again. Thank you.

Thank you. Wow. Wow. Thank you very much, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. November 3rd, get out there and vote, and keep your eyes open if you see any shenanigans, which you probably will, okay? If you see people like dumping things, flushing things. If you see people dropping them in a wastepaper basket, seven or eight, right, wastepaper. Keep your eyes open. This is a smart group of people right here.

Also with us are a group of warriors from Washington that are fantastic, that love you. We’ll start Dan Meuser. Dan, thank you very much. Where’s Dan? That’s not a very good location, Dan. It’s not like you. Thank you, Dan. Congressman Scott Perry. Scott. Thank you, Scott. Great job. These are warriors, I’m telling you. They fight as hard as you can fight, every one of them. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd. Thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. Thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. Great job. Congressman Fred Keller. Thank you, Fred. Great job. The great John Joyce. Thanks, John. A real good friend of mine, and somebody that I’ll tell you he’s as tough as they come, and he loves Pennsylvania, Mike Kelly. Thank you, Mike.

Do you like having these guys by your side? Also, a man, sort of a legend I would say around here. He told me a long time ago, four years ago he told me, “You’re going to win.” I said, “How do you know?” He said, “I know, I know. I can tell.” He said, “I see people with Trump stuff on that never cared about a politician in their life. Now they’ve got the hat, and the sash, and the belt, and the shoes.” He said, “I’ve never seen …” He called it a long time ago. Former Congressman. We’ve got to get him back in, I guess. Well, he left because he had a lot of good things to do, but he’s fantastic. Oh, we got to get him back, Lou Barletta. Great guy. We have a congressional candidate who I hear is leading, Jim Bognet. Where’s Jim? Jim, I hear you’re leading, Jim. We’ll get involved. You have my total endorsement, okay. You know that. Total endorsement for Jim? My Pennsylvania Campaign Chair, Bernie Comfort. Bernie, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bernie. Great job. What a great job, huh? Wow. Have you done a job? Thank you. How are we doing by the way, Bernie?
You have done it. Thank you very much. Also, state GOP Chairman, a friend of mine for a long time, Lawrence Tabas. Lawrence, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That’s a great group of people. Thank you all. We’re going to have a big victory. Lawrence, you agree with Bernie, right? I think we’re going to have a big, big victory, bigger than even four years ago. That was good. Remember they wouldn’t announce it. We were like a point up, which some people say is a lot. I think we’ll do a lot better this time, because at that time I said I was going to do things but, you know, a lot of people say things. Now I’ve accomplished more than I ever said I would in the campaign, so it’s different.

I think we’re going to have the kind of numbers that people are going to be very surprised at. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over his 47 years in politics, along with his other friends. He championed every globalist betrayal of Pennsylvania for almost half a century. He supported NAFTA. I got rid of that one. South Korea, renegotiated that one. TPP, got out of that one. China’s entry into the World Trade Organization which he said was a wonderful thing. No it wasn’t, it was a terrible thing. That’s when China took off like a rocket ship, but you know what, China was going to overtake us. For 10 years they said, “2019, 2019, they’re going to overtake …” Guess what, we way outdid them in ’18 and ’19, and we picked up.

If you have somebody smart, you got to have somebody smart, but if you have somebody smart in this position, your President, they’ll never overtake you. They’ll never ever … They have more people but they’ll never overtake you if you have somebody smart. Biden’s NAFTA and China deals wiped out one-third of your state’s manufacturing jobs. You know that better than anybody. Biden shouldn’t be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness. That’s a little hokey, little hokey, but [ 00:48:24].

In a true sense this election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, or whatever state we’re talking about and China, but we’re doing well. You know, it’s interesting, we signed a great deal. The farmers have done more business in the last two or three weeks. Biggest corn orders ever. The biggest soybean, biggest cattle, biggest beef orders. But, you know, it doesn’t mean as much to me. The ink wasn’t even dry and the plague came over. Am I right? It wasn’t even dry, it just doesn’t mean what it would have meant. We made a great deal but it doesn’t mean the same anymore, because they could have stopped it from coming here. If Biden wins, China wins, and where’s Hunter wins. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter?

He’s a guy walks into China walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage, and the most sophisticated guys in Wall street, I know I’m this smart, they can’t do that, and it took him 10 minutes, walked out with a billion and a half dollars to manage. You make millions of dollars a year on that. When we win, Pennsylvania wins, and America wins, and that’s what’s happening. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars in areas and countries that you’d never even heard of, and defending foreign borders. Now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.
Now our opponents are pledging to rejoin the job-killing Paris Climate Accord, a disaster for our country. It was meant to hurt us, it was meant really to take advantage of us. We would have spent trillions of dollars. You would have ended up closing a lot of your plants and factories. I said, “I’m going to do this, I’m going to get out of this crazy deal,” and I did. I said, “Oh, they’re going to kill me.” You know what, the people got it. They understood it. It was ripping off our country, because we have things that they don’t have, like unbelievable wealth under our ground. They don’t want us to use it. Oh, that’s nice, that’s a wonderful thing. Thank you very much. I withdrew from that catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pennsylvania, not for Paris. We’re putting America first. It’s been a long time, right? From day one I put America first. To defend our workers I imposed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I saved our auto industry by withdrawing from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have killed …

What I’ve done for Michigan, in particular, also Pennsylvania, but what I’ve done for them with autos, forget it. They’re building 17, or expanding 17, different plants. They hadn’t built one in 42 years and we’re building a lot of them. We have countries, you want to do business with us, go in and build auto plants. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, which is great. You’re not going to be losing companies to Mexico and Canada, very disadvantageous for them to do that. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Pennsylvania’s jobs. I proudly signed the historic Executive Order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American.

Now, I watched Biden two weeks ago. What’s going on? This lid, do you know what a lid is? He keeps putting, Bernie, keeps putting a lid. He’s got a lid. It’s 8:00 o’clock in the morning. Now a lid means you’re out for the day. That means the fake news media can go home. You know, he’s got one … Isn’t that the easiest job I’ve ever seen, they never have to work. The media, please go home. There won’t be any activity from sleepy Joe Biden today. He’s a low-energy individual. Now, you need a president with a lot of energy. You deal with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. Remember we’re going to be in a war with North Korea, right? What happened? What happened to the war? A lot happened? We didn’t do anything, say anything. We didn’t do anything but millions of people could have been killed in that nuclear war, it probably would have been nuclear. But look at it. You know, getting along with these foreign nations is not a bad thing. They say, “Oh, he gets along.” Yeah.

I asked Obama, I was sitting … He told me the biggest problem we had was North Korea, and he was telling me why. He was telling me lots of horror stories. I said, “Uh, excuse me, have you ever tried calling him?” I got nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? One is for Israel and Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, right? By the way, many countries are coming and they’re all calling now. “We want to come in.” They’re going to all come in. No more blood in the sand. No, we just did it smart. We reversed it. The art of the deal. It’s the art of common sense, let me tell you. We reversed it, and many countries are going to come in.

I told this story the other night. Then I got one for Kosovo and Serbia. They’ve been killing each other for many years, just killing each other. They don’t get along, they don’t. They’re sort of like the Palestinians and Israel. So, I have two, I have Kosovo and … You know, we’re dealing with both of them. I said to them, “Why are you fighting and killing each other?” They have a lot of differences, including a religious difference, I guess. I said, “What are you doing?” We trade with both, so we have certain power. So I said, “Listen, let’s get a deal. Let’s make economic peace, and ultimately peace.” They came to my office, the Oval Office, to sign. They were hugging. They were so, I mean it was a beautiful thing to see. We saved a lot of lives.

I told this last night, I said to my, … I said to my great First Lady, our great First Lady. “Melania,” I said, “Melania, First Lady.” I said, “First Lady, Oh, I’ve got to watch television tonight. I’m going to come home early,” because let me tell you 6:30 is very early. I stay in there late. “I’m going to come home early. I’m going to show you what a great job. I just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and we’re going to sit there and I’m going to just soak it in, Darling. Let’s turn on NBC fake news, Lester Holt. Number two rated show, he’s number two, heading south. I find NBC to be worse than the other [ 00:55:58]. They spend all that money on their PR and I screw it up in one evening like this.

When Obama got it nobody knew what he got it for, including him. Remember, they said, “What did you get it for?” “I don’t know.” That’s how different … We have to work harder. He got a Nobel Prize and he didn’t have any idea why he got it, and then he started dropping bombs two weeks later on some place that didn’t work out. It couldn’t work out because he had John Kerry negotiating, who was the worst incompetent. Now, it’s so sad that Iran, that horrible deal. That was a fast plane. That must’ve been one of the new ones we just bought. We have all new equipment, that was scary. If I’m the enemy I don’t want to hear that sound.

I said to our First Lady, First Lady, turn on the television, turn it on, Darling. It’s going to be a big evening. I’d toast you but I don’t drink, Darling. I just don’t drink. Not so-

I’d toast you, but I don’t drink tonic. Just don’t drink. Not so bad. So we turned it on and they did a story on the weather. It was raining heavily in a certain area, and they did a story on something else, something else, and something else. Then they went into another story, then another, and then they had a commercial that lasted for about nine minutes. Even though they’re not supposed to make money, they’re using our free airwaves for fake news. Okay. They’re using free airwaves. Think about that. We’re thinking about that. We’re thinking about that. Why are they using free airwaves to give fake news? So it came toward the end, I said, “Darling, I’m a little embarrassed.” But the following day, I got nominated for another one. I called her up. I said, “Maybe they forgot. So let’s go home and turn on the television.”

It was the same thing. They had another story that this time they’re cleaning up the rain. Another one, another one, another one, got to the commercial, never ended, kept back a little tiny piece. And I said, ” They didn’t cover two Nobel prizes.” I got two in one week. Did you ever hear that one? For different things, totally unrelated. And my only complaint is I should have gotten about seven or eight, because if you knew some of the other things, some of the other things I’ve done them much better. I should have gotten seven.

But the fake news never even put it on. And somebody had a show where they said the amount of time devoted to Donald Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize, two of them, zero on the network, zero, than the amount of time devoted to something else that was negative for somebody in the Republican party. Like infinite. It is so disgraceful. They’re so bad, but we just have to keep on winning. There’s nothing like winning. Just keep on winning. Keep on winning.

See now, they’ll tell that story differently. They won’t tell it as we do it in fun, because I understand them. You have to laugh. If you can’t laugh, you’d be out of here fast, right? Like Beto when he said, “I was born to run for president.” That was on a magazine. He was on a fake magazine, Vanity Fair, which is dying. That sucker’s dying. Boy, those magazines are going down fast. But he was on a fake magazine, Vanity Fair, I think. And he started saying about he had a good week, good week. And he started saying, “I was born to do this. I was born to run for president.” I said, “He’s not going to last very long.” And about two weeks later, it was over. He was put in charge of taking your guns away, though. Bye-bye, you know that, right? Beto, Beto, how do you get the name Beto? He made it a little Spanish because his last name is Beto O’Rourke. Where does the Beto come from? Another phony deal going on there.

To protect American workers during the pandemic, I suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened U.S. jobs, and we will always care for our citizens first. Biden’s pledge to terminate these protections and give away your jobs, under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. And we are just finishing a beautiful wall. That wall 340 miles, 340. They don’t talk about the wall.
They don’t talk about the wall. I got sued by Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy. I got sued, and I made one big mistake in the wall. I always say, “We have to build the wall, build the wall, build the wall,” right? I should have just said very simply, “We will not build the wall.” The money would have come pouring. They would have insisted that we build it. And remember, walls work. Remember when they said walls don’t work? Walls don’t work. They want to give us drones so we can watch the people pour across the border. Drones, put a drone half a mile up in the air. You can watch everybody come into the United States. No, remember that, though? They said…

Well, but two things work, and I say it all the time. When you come up, when you’re a brilliant scientist, you develop a new chip, you develop a new laptop or computer, in about three weeks, it’s obsolete. It’s worthless, right? A wall will never be obsolete. And what else won’t be obsolete. A wheel. There’s two things that will never be obsolete, a wall and a wheel. Everything else is trouble. Now we’re up to 330 miles. We’re averaging 10 miles a week. It’s everything to Border Patrol because I got them in. I said, “Fellows, could you give me a little less expensive version, please?” But we have a great wall going, and it’ll be finished very soon. But the press doesn’t talk about the wall anymore. They don’t want to talk. It’s not a good subject for them.

Since 2017, ICE has successfully arrested half a million illegal aliens with criminal records, including over 145,000 assaults, over 40,000 sex offenses and 5,000 killings. I want to thank ICE. Boy, they get beat up. They get beat up by the media. They’re incredible. You would have… Think of the hundreds of thousands of people they take out of here. Real bad ones, too. Murderers, killers, drug dealers. By contrast, Joe Biden supports open borders, zero deportations. That’s in the manifesto. And sanctuary cities that release violent criminal aliens. That’s what they are. They protect the criminal, not our people.

If you want to end sanctuary cities, you have only one choice, and that’s vote Republican. You know how bad it is. All of these places that you’re reading about, all of them, they’re all Democrat-run cities and states. All of them. They’re all Democrat-run because they have no law and order. All they have to do is call us and say, we’ll be in, but they have no law and order. They have nothing. They’re all Democrat-run. They’re a disaster.

We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military and launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the Space Force. And that’s going to be very important. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That’s true. It’s true. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and others, Soleimani. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. They paid $150 billion for nothing. They got nothing. I don’t mind the 150. What I mind, they gave 1.8 billion in cash. What is one point… That would fill up this whole area. Right? 1.8, plane loads of cash. That’s when I realized that a president is very powerful. When you can do that, send that money to a foreign country and no friend, it’s crazy.

I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. You know who likes that the most? Evangelicals like it the most. You know that? Evangelicals love it. We were just with Franklin Graham and a lot of great people. They had a very successful event at the Mall today. I don’t know if you heard about it. It was great. Franklin Graham, all of the top evangelical and other leaders. They were great. They were at the White House ceremony today for the Justice. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of the endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East and it’s costing nothing, costing nothing. Not killing people, no blood in the sand. They’re tired of fighting, by the way, just in case. Even these people that like to fight, they’re tired. Nineteen years in Afghanistan, they’re tired. They all want to sort of relax, as tough as they may be.

Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War. He backed the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, a total horror show. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for the United States. Okay? Not so positive. Now Biden is pushing the most far left platform in the history of our country. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. You know that.

They want to go socialized medicine. Socialized medicine, go to a hospital and take care of yourself. Get rid of 180 million private plans that people love. He would terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. We won the travel ban, remember? And increase refugee admission 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. He wants to ban school choice and ban charter schools. Terrible. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America.

A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and forever. About time. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, the Second Amendment. Right? Second Amendment.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these endless, ridiculous, stupid, foreign wars in countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. You know, we rebuilt our military. You saw it, $2.5 trillion. We have weapons, I mean, just to talk about them, the likes of which no country has ever seen before, the power, the strength, the incredible talent and engineering. We have weapons the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are so far advanced over every other country, and hope to God we never have to use them.

And when I got here, we were a depleted, tired military with great people, but we were exhausted. We had old jet fighters. Now we have brand new F-35s that are stealth. I asked one of the pilots, “How good are these planes compared to the enemy?” He said, “Well, one difference is you can’t see our planes.” I said, “Let me ask you. I know too much about flying. That helps, doesn’t it?” He said, “It really helps, sir.” The guy looked like Tom Cruise, but better. Tom Cruise, but stronger.

We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars very soon. And NASA has become the preeminent space center again in the world. It was tired. It was over.

We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our National Motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania.

So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Most important election we’ve ever had. The most important we’ve ever had. Early voting has already begun, so don’t wait. Go out and vote. From Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, and from Allentown to right here in Middletown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is an incredible place. Our whole history, so much history in Pennsylvania. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. It’s where the army weathered it’s brutal winter at Valley Forge. Where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware, and where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg.

This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers minded the call, worked the railroads, and forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, we’re going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting, and we’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.

Thank you very much. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Go out and vote.",27/9/20
"Hello, everybody. Hello, Duluth. Hello, Duluth. Thank you. Thirty-four days from now, we’re going to win Minnesota. We’re going to go and win four more beautiful years in the White House and do more than anybody’s ever done before from the White House. We’re looking to set records. I really enjoyed last night’s debate with Sleepy Joe. I brought those hats out here because Minnesota is a little on the windy side. Like a genius, I sent them all out, and I’m getting blown to fishes, then that’s fine. That’s okay. I love it. I love you to have whatever we have. We have it together, that I can tell you.

The verdict is in and they say that we, we, all of us, won big last night. I don’t know. Did you hear about this? In the history of cable television, it had the highest ratings of any show in the history of cable television. It had the second highest ratings of overall television in the history of television. Does anybody know what was first? Like M*A*S*H or something? I guess M*A*S*H, they had the final episode of M*A*S*H, and I don’t know what was first. Does anybody know? But we were second in the history of all of television, but the biggest ratings in the history of cable television. It’s an honor.

Last night, I did want the corrupt media has refused to do. I held Joe Biden accountable for his 47 years of lie, 47 years of betrayal, and 47 years of failure. I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad, and for bowing to the violent mob at home. Can you imagine these people the way they take over these Democrats cities? I don’t even believe it. The whole nation saw the truth. Did you see last night, name one, I said, “Sleepy Joe, name one law enforcement group that supports you.” Then, Chris Wallace says, “Don’t do that.” Can you believe this guy? I was debating two people last night.

I was debating two people last night. Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country. You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of the debates. Now, I understand he’s canceling the debates. Let’s see what happens. I think that’s not going to be a good move. I don’t think that’s going to be a good move. Television, with those ratings, they’re never going to let them cancel. You don’t know television like that. What are they going to do? Someday, we’re not going to be doing this anymore. What are they going to do without Trump? What are they going to do?

Those poor people. Look at all of them, whoa. That’s a lot of people. What are they going to do? What are they going to do when in eight, 12, maybe 16 years, I said, “Let’s hang it up. Let’s hang it up.” 16 more years. But what he’s doing is what you do when you lose. So, let’s see what he does. I don’t think he’s going to get that. I’ve got news for Joe. If you ever became president, you have to deal with some of the toughest people in the world, and Chris Wallace is very, very easy by comparison. I will tell you. I know him. I know him well.

Liberal media is upset that I took the fight to Biden and exposed his very dangerous agenda. There’s a beauty. Here we go. Here we go. There’s another beauty out there. Go home to mom. Go home. Go home to mom. These are the same media outlets cheering violent demonstrations in the streets, CNN, the New York Times. They think rioting is just, “Okay, just do whatever you want.” You can do whatever you want. You don’t have to wear a mask. You just riot, 25,000 people standing on each other’s face. Do whatever you want. Can you go to church? No.

Can you go to restaurants? No. Can you do anything? No, but you can riot. That’s okay. Arson’s okay, but challenging Sleepy Joe is totally off limits. So, disappointed in Fox. I’m not just running against Joe Biden. I’m running against the corrupt far-left media, socialists, and communists, and the Democrat Party, and the special interests who’ve made a living bleeding our country dry. That’s what’s happened for too long. We’ve turned it around, but don’t forget when they turned it around, I had to fight other things like a fake impeachment.

I had to fight a lot of things that are not like it wasn’t in the agenda. Never forget that we fought it very well, and frankly, we had great support from the Republican Party except for one person, but that’s all right. We had great support. Never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and that’s true. This is a choice election. Our opponents put America last. I put America first, and that’s what I’ve been doing for three and a half years. Our opponents want to erase borders. I will defend our borders.

You see what’s going on in the southern border. By the way, that wall, 350 miles already, got to be finished very soon. They don’t talk about the wall anymore, fellas. What’s going on? They don’t talk about it. They used to talk about it every day, “He’s not going to get his financing.” But when you’re a real estate developer, you always get financing. This was easy. “He’s not going to get his financing.” Then, we got our finance, they don’t talk about it anymore. We’re up to 300, almost 360 miles. We’re doing about 10 miles a week. Yeah, Mexico is paying for it. You do know that, right?

They keep saying, “There’s going to be a border charge at the border for the trucks and cars.” It won’t even have to be a lot. There’s so many cars and trucks going through, but Mexico is paying for it and they’ve been great. They have 27,000 soldiers right now on our border, and we appreciate it. We appreciate the President of Mexico. Our opponents will send your jobs to China. I will keep your jobs in America. Our opponents want to erase our nation’s core value, and I want to defend, preserve our nation’s historic values. Our opponents stand with rioters. I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. Did you see last night? I said, “Say the words, don’t even say good or bad. Sleepy Joe, say law enforcement.” He goes, “No, I’d rather not.” “Say law enforcement, Sleepy Joe.” “Law enforcement with safety.” “No, no, no. Just law enforcement.” They tell me that all time, too, please just say law enforcement with safety. No, it’s just law enforcement. It’s very simple. It’s a very simple term. Not with safety, unsafety. It’s law enforcement. He wouldn’t say it. Then, I said, “Name one group in the entire nation,” I’ve got Minnesota now, I’ve got everybody, “name one group in the entire nation from law enforcement that’s supporting you.”

Well, well, well, thank Chris Wallace, “Okay. let’s go to the next question. He’s in trouble. He’s in trouble. Let me protect him for Fox.” Joe Biden says, antifa is just an idea. Well, ideas don’t assault cops and they don’t burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization. I proudly received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, and law enforcement organizations and departments in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota. Good.

I was getting worried. Texas, New York’s finest. They’d never done it before. They came in New York’s finest, you see great people, they could solve that problem in two minutes. All they want is their authority back. It’s been taken away from them, horribly. New York’s finest never endorsed a candidate for president before, and they’re great people. They can do it. New Jersey, Illinois, and many, many more. I won’t bore you, but I could go on and on that. I just said, “Joe, give me one, please.” He was joking. I’ll tell you, he got saved. Joe Biden is saying he owns the socialism and extremism in his party, that he owns it.

You know it’s not his party. It’s not Joe’s party. You got crazy Bernie, you have AOC plus three, you got all these crazy people, these maniacs, you have the green new deal. How about the green new deal? He disavowed it. Then, he said, “No, I agree with it.” I said, “Joe, it’s a hundred trillion dollars. That’s more money than this country can make in the next hundred years if everything’s perfect.” It’s so crazy. He wants to rebuild every building. Take it down and rebuild every building. Let’s see, does that include the Empire State? Well, let’s take it down and rebuild it. These people are crazy. No, more cows, no more airplanes, no more nothing.

Biden even vowed to eliminate our tax cuts. That means he’ll take away your child tax credits, because I gave you child tax credits, a thousand dollars a child. He wants to take away what I gave you and revoke our historic tax relief, right to the middle-class it went. Joe Biden also refused to answer questions about packing the Supreme Court. Don’t you love the Supreme Court? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? Her professor at Notre Dame, one of the most highly respected … Fill that seat, fill that seat. You better believe it. How good is she? So, her professor, one of her professors, one of the most highly respected legal scholars in the country said, “I’ve been teaching for a long time,” said, “she is the finest.”

She was first in her class, graduated first in her class. He said she is the finest student he’s ever had. Of all the students, thousands of students, she’s the single best student that he’s ever had. You know what I’m saying? She would have run for president instead of Joe. He was like last in his class. Can you imagine? This is a big difference. I don’t know. How do you like Amy for the Supreme Court? Yes? If he gets elected, the hard left will appoint radical justice-

If he gets elected, the hard left will appoint radical justices who will terminate the second amendment. No more guns. No more guns. As you all saw, Biden also refused to explain why his son Hunter was paid $3.5 billion protected by Chris, by the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. And they talk about me with Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. And took out $1.5 billion from China. He manages, makes millions of dollars a year. Right? Then he got the 183. Right? $183,000 a month. Would anybody like that job? You don’t have a job. You’re not employed. You get thrown out of the military for unfortunate reasons. Your father becomes vice-president and you get hired for $183,000 a month with I think a $3 million upfront payment. I think they could have had him for less. Would anybody take that job?

And he knows nothing about energy. What do you know about energy? Well, that’s not my thing. Oh, that’s okay. I mean, could you imagine if I did it? How about when sleep Joe said, “You’re not getting the $1 billion unless you get rid of the prosecutor. When you get rid of the prosecutor we’ll send you the money.” They got rid of the prosecutor. He said, “Now the money comes.” I mean, can you imagine if I said that? Unbelievable. And the press doesn’t want to talk about it. And Chris Wallace is like, “We don’t want to discuss that.” Oh really, Chris? It’s so sad. I’ll tell you. It’s so hypocritical. So sad. This is a matter of national security and economic security. The Bidens got rich while American workers got robbed. How can you deal with China if you take out three and a half billion dollars and make all sorts of money? How can you do it?

A critical issue in this election, you saw what I did with China, billions and billions a year, they pay us. I gave a lot of it to the farmers, $28 billion. A critical issue because they were targeted by China. A critical issue in this election is the future of the Minnesota Iron Range. You know what. That’s why I’m here. This was just supposed to be a little get together. And then they said, “Sir, we got thousands of people want to show up. I don’t know.” I don’t know how many are involved. This is the best to be an Iron Range get together. But it turns out big. Biden has 20, 30 people. He’s got those circles. Today he had a little bit more like 30 or 40, but they were too close together. I sent him a note to Joe. They were too close. 34 people right next to each other. And yet he complained about our rally, right? Our rallies.

Now it’s an honor that so many people showed up because this was going to be a little quickie just to say congratulations because Obama closed the Iron Range and I opened it and a man came up to me, a tough man, a worker, a construction worker, real worker. And he looked at me, this is two years ago, he said, “Sir, you’ve given us back our life.” And he was crying. And I said, “When was the last time you cried?” He said, “I can’t remember.” I said, “You never cried when you were a little baby. You never cried.” This is not a crier. This guy was tough as hell. He said, “Sir, he took our life away.” And let me tell you about Joe. Joe will re-institute that ban in two minutes if we lose. So you better vote for me in Minnesota. Really, I mean honestly. He said, “You gave our lives back. A lot of lives. Thousands of jobs.” And they closed it up. As Vice President Joe Biden wiped out. He wiped out so much, and that includes what he wiped out in the great state of Minnesota. And we’re not going to let it happen anymore. We’re not going to let it happen anymore. Thousands and thousands of workers, we’re not going to let it happen anymore. They were all laid off and now they’re all back. By the way they say, what the hell do I know about iron ore? A lot of steel than a lot of iron over the years. But they say it’s the greatest iron ore anywhere in the world and you should have. After I put tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back.

But the biggest thing I did was knock out his executive order. I’ve knocked out so much in the things that he did. He can’t like me too much. I would say he doesn’t like me too much. Hey, did you see what happened with the FBI today? They caught them cold. Comey either has the worst memory in history. I don’t remember that. Did you spy on President Trump’s campaign? “Gee, I don’t remember that.” “Did you go for a coup? Did you go for a coup?” ” I don’t remember. I don’t know.” I’ll tell you. We caught him cold. It’s about time that something happens. Okay. It’s about time that something happens. It’s enough. We got plenty of information in these crooks, bunch of crooks. A thing like that’s never happened in the history of our country, and it’s about time that something happens.

We rescinded the federal withdrawal in Superior National Forest. You’ll know all about that, you people especially, to restore mineral exploration for the iron ore miners in Minnesota. What we’ve done for Minnesota. I lose Minnesota, I’m never coming back. I don’t care. I’m never coming back. We’ve protected Iron Range workers from frivolous lawsuits. That was a big deal. Right? The frivolous lawsuits. We started construction on the Soo Lock to get iron ore to market very quickly. So not only did we open it, we get it to market. We fixed the locks because you couldn’t even get it out. Those things were so old and broken. Now they’re going to be very shortly in perfect shape.

I opened up permitting for copper nickel, mining, anybody involved there? It sounded a little far out, but you got a lot of people doing that. I strongly support the replacement of the decaying Line 3 pipeline. We’re going to replace it. It’s all done. It’s all done. All of this is why nine Democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over sleepy Joe Biden. Are they here tonight? I don’t know if they’re here tonight. These people are fantastic. Look at these great congressmen. Where are they? Oh, stand up. Wow. We had a ceremony a month ago where I introduced every one of them. I’m not introducing you again. It’s freezing out here. But I want to thank you. You’re great people. Great mayors. I appreciate the support very much. These are Democrats that want to vote for Trump. That endorsed me fully. We’ve done a good job over there. Everything in good shape? Right? Thank you very much. It’s a great honor.

If Joe gets in, the radical left will shut down the Iron Range forever. It’s going to be gone. They’re not going to be able to open it again. Not easy to open a thing like that. Not easy. A lot more difficult than people would think. Earlier today, I took another historic step for your state when I signed an executive order, provided billions of dollars to jumpstart production of critical and other minerals, which will create countless jobs that are so important for our country. Minerals. I will always protect the state of Minnesota. I will do that. It’s been very good to me. We almost won it. We almost won it.

One more speech. I had a choice. Do I do Michigan, which we won? I should’ve done them both. One more speech. We lost by very little. Think of that though. Hasn’t been won by a Republican. I don’t get that because the Democrats have done such a lousy pathetic job. Hasn’t been one since 1972. Reagan lost. It was the only state he lost. Remember? So we’re going to change that. We’ve got to change it. Who’s going to do what we’ve done for you? Right?

Another massive issue for Minnesota is the election of Joe Biden’s plan to inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees. Biden and crazy Bernie Sanders have agreed on a manifesto. Did you see last night? I didn’t agree. I [ 00:21:47] show and they said, “Oh, actually he did.” Oh, great. They fact checked. They found out he made a mistake. Slight mistake. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen. But they pledged a 700% increase in refugees. 700%. Congratulations, Minnesota. Congratulations. And what about Omar where she gets caught harvesting? What the hell is going on? I hope your US attorney is involved. What is going on with Omar? I’ve been reading these reports for two years about how corrupted, crooked she is. Let’s get with it. Let’s get with it. I mean, frankly harvesting is terrible, but it’s the least of the things that she has done. How the hell… Then she tells us how to run our country. Can you believe it? How the hell did Minnesota elect her? What the hell is wrong with you people? Right? What the hell happened? These guys in the… Stand up. Are you a big fan of Omar? I don’t think so. Stand up. Look at this guy. It looks like nobody’s going to fight him. I don’t think you’re a big fan of Omar. Right? No, she’s been crooked for a long time. This is the least of it. It’s time. And you know what? AOC also. It’s time. It’s time. You take a look at the corruption, the disgusting corruption. 700% increase refugees coming from the most dangerous places in the world including Yemen, Syria, and your favorite country, Somalia, right? You love Somalia. This guy loves Somalia.

Biden will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. And he said that. Overwhelming public resources, overcrowding schools, and inundating your hospitals. You know that. It’s already there. It’s a disgrace what they’ve done to your state. It’s a disgrace. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban on jihadist regions, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Remember I used to talk about it all the time? I got a ban. Remember they said he’d never be able to get a ban? And then I lost at the lower court. I lost at the court of appeals. And they said, “He lost, he lost.” [ 00:24:03] then I won at the Supreme Court. They didn’t even report it. Yeah. They still say, “He lost on the travel ban. He lost, he lost.” But they’re talking about the first two courts. They forget to say that the Supreme court. This is the most [ 00:24:18].

It’s hard to believe actually, but look at all those cameras. That’s a lot. They love it. Every time I’m getting ready, they’ve gotten very good at this, every time I’m getting ready to hit them, the lights just go off. You know those red lights? They go [ 00:24:31]. My administration is keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals out of our country. And we’re keeping them the hell out of Minnesota. We’ve ended the refugee influx into your state. You were one of the most hard hit states for whatever reason. We’ve ended it. You know that, right? You know that. Does anybody know this? Does anybody know this? I don’t think they tell you about it. But they talk about the suburbs, women in the suburbs. I ended a regulation that nobody would have done. This brings public housing, low-income housing into the suburbs. By the way, just so we can get this right, 30% of the people in the suburbs are low income people. 30% of the people in the suburbs are minorities.

So we’re ruining this American dream for everybody, but he’s got a plan. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen having to do with zoning. They zone you out. They build low-income housing next to your house. It’s crazy. Then I hear I’m not doing well in the suburbs. I’m not doing well in the suburbs. Are you people crazy? Are you crazy? I just explained this. No, I just explained it. Thank you. No, it’s crazy. And they came to me, great people. Ben Carson, a lot of great people and they came to me and they said, “Sir, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “No, really, I want it out. I want it over. I want it ended.” Well, it’d be a lot easier to amend it. I said, “No, I want it over. It’s not right. It’s killing your suburbs. And it is. It’s killing your suburbs.” And then they say women in the suburbs don’t like President Trump. I don’t think-

“Women in the suburbs don’t like President Trump.” I don’t think so. That happened last time. Remember last time? They said, “He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women.” These were the idiots on election night four years ago, “He will not do… This will be a very short night for Donald Trump,” at the time. “This will be a very short,” and at the end they said, “He did really well with women.” It was sort of weird.

Anyway, we did well with everybody, actually, and we’re going to do even better now. We have more… Look at this crowd, this was supposed to be a few people. This was supposed to be just a little celebration. I said, “Oh, good. A little celebration.” I figured a couple of hundred people like Sleepy Joe gets it his best day. I said, “How many people?” “About 10,000, Sir.” I said, “Oh, that’s nice.”

In just three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s border, rebuilt awesome power of the US military, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and they were a disaster, and brought jobs back home to America. And back home to Minnesota, we brought a lot of jobs back.

Last year before the plague came in from China, you had the best year you’ve ever had. The year before that, you had the best year you’ve ever had until the following year, and we’re doing it again, we’re building it up rapidly. China came up, they gave us the plague, it’s no good, we’re never going to forget that. I did a trade deal, the ink wasn’t even dry, and they let that happen. We’re never going to forget it.

We built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we are quickly doing it again. We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. That’s a record the likes of which has never even been close to being challenged. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since world war II, we pioneered lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that, meaning you go to the hospital and you got a lot better chance.

I’ll tell you what. I spoke to a gentleman today from Pfizer. I speak to all of these guys, these are great people, and they’re coming up with things that are phenomenal, Regeneron, we are coming up with things that are phenomenal, including therapeutics for therapies. It’s incredible what’s happening. You’ll be seeing it very… And By the way with Biden, it would have been years before you came up with any of this stuff. Years, it would have been years.

He complains, “You did not fast enough.” And yet he’s all over the place calling me xenophobic because I closed the border. Okay, how do you figure that one? This guy, just a politician. He’s just another politician. 47 years he hasn’t done a damn thing, but now he’s going to. “I haven’t done anything in 47 years, but now I’m going to.”

Europe is almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States, you don’t hear that. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time, it’s going to be very, very soon. And before the end of the year, maybe sooner than that. On November 3rd, Minnesota will decide whether we end this pandemic, defeat the virus, and return to record prosperity. Either way, we’re returning, either way. We’re going to have the vaccine. We’re [ 00:03:38].

Well, whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recovery… He wants to shut down. This guy says, “Let’s shut it down.” A lot of deaths caused by shutdown; depression, death, drugs, alcoholism, horrendous family fights, horrendous family fights, and he wants to destroy those suburbs by abolishing single family zoning. All of these things are just a horrible thing, what he wants to do. And I think he’s going to do it because he’s not smart enough to understand that the other side has big problems.

You know, we did something great. We had the greatest economy in history and we had to close it down because we would have lost millions of lives, and now we’re opening it up and we’re doing it at a level like nobody’s ever seen before, and it’s a great thing, and we’re going to be back in business very soon, except for some Democrats.

And they’ll all open up. They’re going to all open up right after November 3rd. They’ll announce, “We’d like to tell you that we’re all opening up November 4th.” Did you see the one group that said, “We’re opening up right after the election, I think we’ll open up.” That’s great.

These are terrible people because they’re more interested in politics than they are in the lives of people. They want to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children to this poisonous anti-American rhetoric and lies. To combat the toxic left… And you see this, that toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission.

We will teach our children the truth about America that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. That’s what I want them to hear. We are joined tonight by some real warriors, friends of mine. They fight with… they just win, they know how to win. I’m telling you, you have some great ones and they really are, they’re great people. The impeachment hoax, they fought it so great. These are real warriors. I call them warriors.

Representatives Tom Emmer, Jim Hagedorn and Pete Stauber, great hockey player. And I’ll tell you, we have some incredible congressional candidates that we’re going to work because we got to get Nancy Pelosi the hell out of there, and we’re very [ 00:32:10]. We have some candidates; Tyler Kistner, where’s Tyler? Thank you, Tyler. Great job. I hear great things, Tyler.

A man with the greatest name in politics, Lacy Johnson, great guy, great guy. And somebody who’s going to help us a lot along with Tyler, Lacy, Michelle Fischbach. Thank you Michelle. Thank you. We’re going to be working with you, and they all have my total endorsement, you know that. Okay?

The next US Senator from Minnesota is a man who was born for this position unlike your current Senator, who nobody knows who the hell she is. I said, who is she? Is she in the Senate? Jason Lewis. Thank you, Jason. Great job you’re doing. We got to get Jason in, got to get them all in. RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Thank you, Tommy. And Mike Lindell, he makes more pillows this guy. He makes more pillows, thank you Mike. He goes to a lot of my rallies, he likes these rallies, and we like him. Here as well tonight is 96-year-old world war II veteran, Dr. John [Ringsred 00:07:35]. Look at you. You look great, John. Wow. You look good. Handsome. Thank you, John. Thank you very much. It’s an honor, john. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. In 2017, I signed a very historic executive order making it difficult and really just looking at what government policy has to do in order to buy American and hire American. You ever see Biden? He’s got a sign, buy American. I said he got it from me. I’ve been doing this for a long time. Copies my campaign, copies our plans. He copies a lot, like you haven’t heard that before.

He invested $2.5 trillion in the military, we put 2.5 trillion in. We have the best weapons, all made in the USA. We have the greatest weaponry we’ve ever had. No country has ever come close to the kind of firepower we have. Hope to God we never have to use it. We have firepower and weapons and the Republicans said it because Democrats… We have to have that, otherwise we’re going to be at the mercy of other countries. We have the greatest firepower, the greatest weapons in the history of the world. Hope to God that we never have to use them.

And we launched a new branch of the US armed forces, first since the air force in 75 years, it’s called the space force. That’s a big deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi gone. We took out the world’s number one terrorist, and the murderer of so many American troops and plenty of other troops, Qasem Soleimani is no longer with us.

I withdrew from the last administration’s total disaster, the Iran Nuclear Deal. Obama gave them 150 billion. That was bad, but he gave him 1.8 billion in cash. How the hell do you do that? What does 1.8 billion in cash look like? They must have looked at that, they said, “Man, plane loads of cash.”

I kept my promise recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and instead of endless wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. And I was nominated for three Nobel Prizes and I didn’t get one story. I have to tell you, because they refuse to write it.
 
When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was the biggest story I’ve ever seen. And he didn’t even know why he got it. He got it like immediately upon taking office. [ 00:36:46] but I told my first lady, I told our first lady, “Darling, you’re going to be so proud of me tonight. We’re going to watch television and you’re not going to believe how big this [ 00:10:54]” “What happened? What happened?” “Darling, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for Israel, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates. And then I was nominated again for Serbia, Kosovo, all different. Then I was nominated a third time.” But I said, “First time, second time, I was a little bit.”
you. We love you.

Yeah, I know. I love you too. But I said to our First Lady, “Watch this tonight, Darling, it’s going to be.” And I turn to Lester Holt, number two show. I turn to Lester Holt, and they covered one story was about rain, another was about the environment, another was about something else, another, it was a bad hit on me, another one, something else. So now we’re through with about half of it. Now they went to the longest commercial I’ve ever seen.
 
Not supposed to, when you report the fake news, you’re not supposed to get free air time from the US government. Does anybody know what that means? And then they went onto the second half again and again and again, she looked at me, “Darling, I don’t think they’re going to cover this.” I said, “It’s impossible. It’s a nomination for the Nobel Peace award. It’s impossible.” Guess what? It ended, we got nothing. Then three days later we got nothing. And on the third time, the third time I said, “Let’s not even watch. We’re not getting anything. These people are sick.”

But I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far-left platform in history, the Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for people with preexisting conditions, give free federal healthcare to all illegal aliens, bankrupting Medicare.

But you know, it’s going to happen. They’re going to pour into our country. When they hear that, they’re going to come in. They’re very smart, very sophisticated, you’d be surprised. Ban school choice and ban all charter schools. No more charter schools, no more school choice. Well, we’re making a lot of progress-

There’s no more charter schools, no more school choice but we’re making a lot of progress. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. Did you see what he said last night about manufacturing? Well, Obama said we’re not going to ever have manufacturing and you’d need a magic wand. Last night he said we’re doing manufacturing. No, no. They gave up on manufacturing. I have almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. I said, “How can you lose manufacturing?” He’s bad news. They lie.

We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out, we will keep people out of our country. Thank you. But we will keep out of these ridiculous, endless Wars in countries that you’ve never heard of and you never will hear of. It’s ridiculous. And we’re bringing them all home. You see that. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. Ridiculous. We’re all over the world. We’re in places nobody ever heard of before.

We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I’ve already signed it. Can you believe it? It kicks in on January 1st. Can you imagine if this clown gets in? And they’ll say, “He got price transparency. What’s that?” That’ll have such an impact. It kicks in. I said to my people, “You think you could have kicked it in a little bit earlier?” And further reduced health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we’re going to be bringing down massively because of Favorite Nations. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect those incredible people, as I said, with pre-existing conditions.

America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And it will be soon. You have to see. NASA has become again the greatest space center in the world. You had to see what it looked like when I took over. It was terrible. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust.

For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Minnesota. Thank you. But if we don’t win, I’m never calling you great again. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get you co-workers and get out and vote. We got to win. We got to win.
 
Early voting has already begun. Don’t wait. Please go out and vote. Did you see in New York today? A hundred thousand fraudulent ballots. They send out a hundred thousand ballots. Wrong names, wrong addresses, wrong envelopes. Other than that, that did quite well. Think of it, a hundred thousand. So you know what this solution? That’s okay. We’ll send out another a hundred thousand. I said, “Really? What’s going to happen to the first hundred thousand. Who’s going to vote them?” This is crazy what’s going on. This is crazy. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Minneapolis to Minnetonka, and from Rochester to right here in Duluth. I like Duluth.

This great state was pioneered by men and women who brave the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were truly brave, brilliant, incredible people. They were tough and they were strong. They didn’t have a lot of money. They didn’t have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith and they had each other. They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. It’s true. We’re to keep on winning. You know, Minnesota, maybe I’ll just do a [ 00:45:12] because we need Jason. Jason. Where’s Jason? Jason’s going to come. Jason Lewis. He’s going to be your Senator. You’re going to win so much. You know that one, right? You’ve heard it. Should I do it or not? I’ve got this beautiful crescendo of a speech and now I have to ruin it with this story with Jason, but let’s do it anyway.

But we’re going to win so much because Minnesota before I came around was not doing too well. Okay? Was not doing too well. Then you had your best years ever. But we’re going to win so much and you’re going to go and see your great Senator, Jason Lewis. He’s going to say. And you’re going to see Emmer, and you’re going to see all of that. And you’re going to say, Mr. Senator, please go see the President. We’re winning too much. We can’t stand it, sir. Minnesota, we’re not used to winning this much. It’s too much, sir. Please, go see. Well, I don’t want to do that. Please Senator. Go see the President. We’re winning too much. We cannot stand it. For years we’ve done poorly before he came along. Now we’re doing so well. And we’re growing now stronger than ever before. We don’t want to win so much, Mr. Senator.

So your Senator is going to come in. “Hi Jason, how are you doing?” “Sir, Minnesota is winning too much. We have to stop it.” I said, “What are you talking about?” “Sir, we have to stop it. It’s just too much running. We have to stop it.” I say, “Jason, let me tell you. I know the people of Minnesota and they love winning. They’re going to keep winning. We’re going to win. We’re going to win so much. We’re going to keep on winning. And you’re going to have the greatest year that you’ve ever had next year and the year after. And that’s where it’s heading. So I just want to thank you, and Jason, I’m sorry. I will not follow your wish.” Thank you very much.

But we are. We’re one movement. We’re one family. We’re one beautiful people in one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Minnesota, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Go out and vote.
",30/9/20
" Well, thank you very much and keep that enthusiasm going, get out and vote. We got to vote. We got to vote these people into oblivion, vote them into oblivion. Got to get rid of them so bad for our country. First of all, I’m feeling great. I don’t know about you. How’s everyone feeling? Good? And I’m honored to welcome, we call this a peaceful protest to the White House in support of the incredible men and women of law enforcement and all of the people that work so well with us. I have to tell you our black community, our Hispanic community, thank you very much. Thank you.

But before going any further, I want to thank all of you for your prayers. I know you’ve been praying and I was in that hospital. I was watching down over so many people and I went out to say hello to those people. And I took a little heat for it, but I’d do it again. And let me tell you, I’d do it again. On behalf of myself and the First Lady, this has been really an incredible outpouring and we’re starting very, very big with our rallies and with our everything, because we cannot allow our country to become a socialist nation. We cannot let that happen. And that’s what would happen or worse, by the way or worse.

I want you to know our nation’s going to defeat this terrible China virus, as we call it and we’re producing powerful therapies and drugs and we’re healing the sick and we’re going to recover. And the vaccine is coming out very, very quickly in record time. As you know, it’s coming out very, very soon. We have great, great companies doing it and there’ll be distributing it. And we will through our military very, very rapidly, through the power of the American spirit, I think more than anything else, science medicine will eradicate the China virus once and for all. We’ll get rid of it all over the world. You see big flare ups in Europe, big flare ups in Canada, very big flare up in Canada, you saw that today. A lot of flare ups, but it’s going to disappear. It is disappearing and with vaccines are going to help and the therapeutics are going to help a lot.

I just want to thank everyone this afternoon. What beautiful colors. Where did you get that color Candace? Where did that come from? What a beautiful color. I want to get one of them. I want to put one of them on instead of a white shirt. I want to thank you though, seriously.

Every day, more black and Latino Americans are leaving behind left wing politicians and their failed ideology. It’s what they are. They failed for many years and many, many decades. Democrats have run nearly every inner city in America and I mean, for 100 years and their policies have delivered nothing but calamity, poverty and trouble. Sleepy Joe Biden has betrayed black and Latino Americans. If you think he can run this country, you’re wrong. For half a century, shipping your jobs to China, that’s what they’ve been doing. We’re bringing the jobs back. We’ve been bringing them back. We’ve been charging China a lot of money too, with the tariffs, a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars.

Opening your borders to mass illegal immigration. The wall is now 380 miles long. It’ll soon be finished. Trapping us in endless foreign wars, these ridiculous foreign wars that lasts for 19 years, our people are coming back home you know that. And selling you out to the rich global as Wall Street donors, they have the Wall Street donors. They want the Wall Street donors. Someday somebody is going to have to write a little story about that.

Black and Latino Americans are rejecting the radical socialists left and they’re embracing our pro jobs, pro worker, pro-police. We want law and order. We have to have law and order and pro-American agenda. I want to thank the Blexit Foundation for organizing this event. Thank you very much. Thank you. And especially your two founders, two friends of mine, great people, Candace Owens and former Tucson police officer, Brandon Tatum. Thank you, both. Great job. What a great job. Two really brilliant, smart young people. Great. And thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it.

So you’ve just marched to the White House because you understand to protect the lives of black Americans and all Americans, you have to have your police support you. You have to have that. If the left gains power, they’ll launch a nationwide crusade against law enforcement, and they’ve already done that. And you see them. They’re doing that at a level that nobody’s ever seen before.

The other day in the debate Biden couldn’t even use the words law enforcement. I said, “Say law enforcement. Say law enforcement,” and he was bailed out by the anchor. Then I said, very simply I said, “Name one law enforcement group that’s supporting you,” he couldn’t do it, but he was bailed out by the anchor. Second time bailed. He got bailed out by that anchor a lot. Taking their funds away, their firearms, their fundamental authorities, taking everything away, including your freedom. Joe Biden even said, “When you call 911, a therapist should answer the call.” That doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. But this is the people telling him what, because he doesn’t say, he’s told what to say.

You saw what they introduced today. They’ve gone through a period of years. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. All of a sudden gets a nomination, he says, “There’s got to be fracking.” For Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, all of you, there will be if it happens, all of those jobs are gone. Your energy jobs are gone if they get in. Just remember I said it. Just to remember.
I don’t think so either. And I have to say ,there’s been more enthusiasm. We have had more enthusiasm right now, right now this year than we had four years ago by a factor of three times. And we had a lot and they had none. They have no enthusiasm.

More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years. More four years.

They have no enthusiasm. In fact, the gap is so incredible and a poll just came out, I think it said 56% of the people prefer their position now in the midst of a pandemic than they did four years ago. Think of what that means. 56. And it’s a Gallup poll and it’s the highest poll ever recorded. 56%. Now tell me about that. No, we had it going and we really had it going and then the plague came in from China but we’re getting rid of that and we’re rebuilding it and it’s going to be better than it was even before.

But the homes and churches and businesses of black and Hispanic Americans have been looted, you know that. They’ve been vandalized and burned by left wing fanatics, total bad people. They know what they’re doing, yet Biden likes to call them peaceful protesters. You see people, you see anchors from a couple of the very bad, very corrupt networks standing and behind them, the cities are burning and they’re saying, “This is a peaceful protest,” and you look, and everything’s on fire.

I want to thank our law enforcement and I want to thank everybody in the community, in the community drives that are working with law enforcement. I want to thank them. I think we have the support of every law enforcement group in this country practically. I don’t know of any that I don’t. Maybe there must be some, there must be one. They’ll find one tonight. They’ll say, “No, he misrepresented.” But we have a level of support the likes of which nobody’s I don’t think ever seen before. I don’t think so. And you’re going to see that.

Do you see how many crooked ballots are being found and turned back in and fraudulent? Just what I said. Then they’ll say, “He doesn’t believe in freedom.” I totally believe in freedom. That’s called freedom. What we’re doing is freedom. Tremendous problems with the ballots. 50,000 in Ohio, 25,000… You have to see it. I mean, every day there’s a story about ballots. Some thrown out that happen to have the name Trump, military ballots were thrown out with the name Trump on them. But I think we’re going to swamp them by so much. Hopefully, it’s not going to matter. And we have law enforcement watching. We have law enforcement watching all those ballots, they’re being found for a reason.

Left wing politicians like Kamala Harris who really did not do very well the other night. By the way, did our Vice-President do a good job, Candace? That was easy for him. No, he did a great job because we’re in the side of right. We really are. We’re on the side of right. And by the way we are, and it’s true and I say it and I say it all the time now, more and more, we are draining the swamp like nobody in history has ever drained the swamp. Nobody in history has ever drained.

We’re here today to deliver a united message to police officers all across our great land that are American. And I mean every American, every race and color, we love you. Every race, color, creed, we support you. We honor you. It’s a dangerous profession. They’ve been doing an incredible job and I just want to thank them on behalf of everybody here today, because that’s why we’re safe.

In contrast, the Democrat’s socialist program and platform, and it really is more than socialist. It’s not just socialist, it’s beyond socialism. He says, “Communist.” Yeah, that’s about right. But I recently announced my plan to deliver more opportunities, security, fairness, and prosperity to the black community, to the Hispanic community. And you know what it is. I don’t have to go over it, but it’s the Platinum Plan. And it’s going to bring back new jobs, like at a level that you’ve never seen before. And we’ve done a lot. We’ve done a lot, but increase capital. It’s going to increase money coming into the black community, to the Hispanic community where it’s been very much shut out, in advance, very much home ownership and wealth building. And it’s already taking place and it’s taking place at a level, and had we not been hit by the pandemic, you would have seen numbers like you’ve never seen before, but those numbers are already rebuilding again.

We’re going to build up a peaceful and safer neighborhood program like you haven’t seen with the highest standards of policing, we’ll create a healthcare system that delivers better care at a lower cost. Obamacare is a disaster. We want to terminate it. We want to get great healthcare. And that’s what we’re doing. Great healthcare. And we’ll always take care of pre-existing conditions, always. And I think we’re at a point where we’re getting and right now if you look at what we’ve done in healthcare, people don’t talk about it. We’ve done an incredible job. Less expensive healthcare… Much better healthcare at a much less expensive price. You can’t do better than that. And it’s happening and it’s happening fast.

Another thing is school choice. You have to have school choice. Charter schools, school choice. So I make this statement every once in a while and people think it’s a little bit in the bull side but we’ve achieved a historic reduction of violent crime, we signed a landmark criminal justice reform bill that nobody thought was possible to even think about. I did that. I did that. I got that done. And I worked with a lot of people, but we got it done. The Obama administration couldn’t get it done. Biden couldn’t even think about it. He doesn’t even know what it is.

We have prison reform. We achieved the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. The black youth unemployment rate reached the lowest ever again in the history of our country. And last year, black and Hispanic American poverty reached the lowest ever in the history of our country. It’s all building back up so quickly. And if you look at what we’ve done with criminal justice reform, if you look at what we’ve done with historically black colleges and universities, where we funded them, they couldn’t get funded. Nobody was funding that for years and years and decades, nobody was funding them.

And if you look at what we’ve done with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Opportunity Zones and the jobs created. And I’ve said it very strongly and perhaps, I don’t know, criminal justice reform, people say, maybe that’s the best of all but the fact is they’re all great. Every one of them is great. And I say, the fact is that I’ve done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln. I say it. Nobody can dispute it. Nobody can dispute it, it’s true. Nobody can dispute it.

So we are now beginning the fastest economic recovery in history. We created a record 11.4 million jobs just in the last four months. That’s the fastest ever. The US has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major nation anywhere in the world. So we’ve seen the smallest going down. If you look at it, that’s an incredible statement. Our opponents will crush the comeback with unscientific lockdowns. They want to lock everything down. Here we go again. They want to lock it down. We’re not going to let it happened. We’re not going to let it happen. So important you get out and vote. You got to get out and vote.

We got a great poll in Florida. Got a great poll in North Carolina. Got a great poll in Arizona. Got a great poll in Nevada, actually. Just got a great poll in Nevada. I think we’re doing really well. I mean, this is in addition to states that we’re going to win. Georgia is looking fantastic. Texas is looking for fantastic. Well, think about Texas, they have no oil, they don’t want oil. They don’t want guns. They don’t want religion. I don’t think you’re going to win Texas very well. Now, we’ve got a great poll in Texas. We’re getting great polls all over the place and they understand it. It’s driving them crazy. And you know why though? And Candace, it is. It’s because of the spirit. There’s a spirit the likes of which this country hasn’t seen in a very, very long time.

So I just want to thank you all for being on the White House lawn and this beautiful great lawn and I’m very proud of this country. I’m very, very proud. I want to thank all of the doctors and labs and scientists and all of the people that are working so hard because we’re way ahead of everybody. But I just want to thank most particularly you because you people come out and you come out and you cheer and you love your country and you get it. You’re way, way ahead, of many, many people in this country, but the country is getting it. The country is seeing something now.
Thank you. I love you too.

The people of our country and the whole world is watching, are seeing things now that they haven’t seen in this country for decades. They’re seeing a spirit and a resilience like they haven’t seen. I just want to thank you and get out and vote. We got to make this bigger than even four years ago. It’s more important. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. This is more important than even four years ago. I used to say the most important and it was true at the time. This is the single most important election in the history of our country. Get out and vote. And I love you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Thank you, Candace. Thank you. Thank you.

Hello everybody. Hello Orlando. Hello Sanford. It’s great to be with you. Thank you. It’s great to be back. That’s a lot of people. Our competitor sleepy Joe, he had a rally today and practically nobody showed up. I don’t know what’s going on. Sleepy Joe. But it’s great to be back in my home state, Florida to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support. We’ve had such incredible support and here we are. Here we are. But we’re going to finish. We’re going to make this country greater than ever before.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We’ve made tremendous progress. If you look at what we’re doing with therapeutics and frankly cures, we’ve made tremendous progress. And I said to my people, we are going to take whatever the hell they gave me and we’re going to distribute it around to hospitals and everyone’s going to have the same damn thing. We’ve all endured a lot together. And we are doing better by far than we ever did in 2016. The enthusiasm’s greater. The spirit is greater. We’re going to have, if it’s possible, an even greater and more important victory than we had just four years ago. And nobody ever said this fight was not going to be a hard one, but we will make it like you’ve never seen before. We are more successful now than we’ve ever been before. Our military is rebuilt.

Take a look at what’s going on with our economy. I hate to say to the fake news, we’re about to hit another stock market record, 401Ks. Sleepy Joe Biden. Not a nice guy, by the way. I have to be honest. He’s not a nice guy. People say, “Oh, he’s such a nice guy.” He had a very bad day today. He had a very bad day. You saw what happened. If I ever had a day like he had today, they’d say it’s over. It’s over. No Biden had a bad day. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. He didn’t know what state he was in. And he said today he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate. No you can’t. Can’t do it. It’s the second time. Can you imagine if I did that? “It’s great to be with you. It’s great to be a wonderful developer from New York.” They’d say he’s out of here. Get him out. No, Biden had a bad day. He’s got a lot of bad days coming. Look, look, we can’t play games. The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China did us no favor. President Putin of Russia, you’re looking around. Kim Jong-un, whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, they’re 100% sharp. We have somebody running who’s not 100%. He’s not 80%. He’s not 60%. We can’t have this as a country. We can’t have it. Joe Biden is also owned by the radical globalists, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in this ridiculous, endless wars. Set of endless wars that we’ve been in for a long time. 19 years, they’re all coming back home. You know that, right?

They’re all coming back home. Our great warriors, our great soldiers. The corrupt political class is desperate to regain their power by any means necessary. We’re the one standing in their way. We’re the one standing up for the American worker, the American family, and for the American dream. And that’s what we’re doing on this beautiful evening. This beautiful evening in Florida. Oh do I like Florida. Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful?

Everything I hear, we’re winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say, “The polls are tied in Florida.” I don’t get it. I don’t. We heard the same thing last year. Remember? Four years ago, we heard the same thing. ” We’re going to lose Florida,” they said four years ago, “by five points.” They called that thing so early in the evening and we won by a lot. And we’re winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago.

22 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to make our country greater than it has ever been before. Thank you, man. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to say it in 2016. I’m sorry, at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important we’ve ever had. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control to the socialists, the Marxists and the left-wing extremists. And you know that. And he’s got no strength left. He’s got no power left. He’s got nothing going.

If he wins, the radical left will be running the country and they’re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again. And you couldn’t make a comeback. You don’t make comebacks from where they’d take us. If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because frankly, I’m not a politician. I’m embarrassed by the throne. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you. And I had a very nice life before this, I will tell you. And a lot easier. But I love this, that I would have never, ever change because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now. We caught them cold and we’ll see what happens with that. Just watch, stay tuned.

Right now I’m fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. We’re hitting record stock market numbers, record 401Ks, record stocks, record job numbers. Don’t blow it. Don’t blow it. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. He wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again, he said, “Oh no, we’re not going to give a tax increase, but we’re going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.” Well, that’s $2,000 plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things, you’re talking about $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 a year. I don’t think Florida is going to be paying that per family. And if you add energy into that, we have energy at all time low. We’re energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you are paying less than $2 at the pump like you are, nobody ever thought you’d see those days again. And those days are here for a long time if we’re smart. We’ve been beating China. We’ve been beating everybody. Until the plague came in, we were teaching China like they’ve never been taught before and they know it. And they’ve told me that and they never thought it could happen. And we’re very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign. It’s our campaign. It’s our campaign, not my campaign.

There was spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very, very straightforward and legally sworn in administration. We were sworn in. They tried before the fact, they tried after the fact. We were an admin… And then they say, “We want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power.” For four years, they’ve been trying to get us out of office. Four years they’ve been trying to get us out, but we’ll take care of it all after the election. We caught them cold. We caught them cold. Bad people, crooked Hillary.

And by the way, Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening, okay? Just in case you had any question. We’ll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists, but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. Because we don’t, they’ll just sweep it under the rug. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders. You know that? Release criminal aliens, confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment, get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. That’s what’s going to happen.

You saw in the pledge of allegiance during the Democrat National Convention. They took the word God out twice. They said, “Oh, we made a mistake. Excuse me.” And then it happened a second time. We said, “Well, I guess that wasn’t a mistake, right?” Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many, many, many decades. And that’s what they want to do. They can’t get there legitimately. So they’re said, “That’s all right. We’ll just pack the court. We’ll put a lot of super lefties on the court and we’ll have a whole different country.” Nope. Not going to happen that way. We’re not going to let it happen. You got to get out and vote.

A lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court, because I said I’m going to put great conservative, constitutionalists, great judges on the Supreme Court. I don’t know if it’s true. But if it is true, it’s more true now than it was four years ago. And you got to get out and vote because they’re going to destroy our country and they’re going to destroy our US Supreme Court, and we can’t let that happen.

But who would have thought? We’re on number three. Other presidents have never had any. They’ve never had any. We’re at three already, three and a half years. And I will say this, I will say this. It’s driving them crazy. It’s driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect, a great scholar. I think she’s going to be a fantastic US Supreme Court Justice.

As America saw earlier today in Amy’s opening statement in the Senate, Judge Barrett, a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws, our rights, our freedom, and our constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what they’re doing and where they’re going, but we understand it. We understand their canceled culture. We’re not letting them cancel culture us at all. We’re proud of our country and we’re proud of our heritage.

They want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare, and that’s what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela, and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans. And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida. You have been so incredible to Trump. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors. And by the way, Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that, right? And you know the deal that I broke, you saw that? Right as I came into office, Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said, “No, thank you. We’re not doing that.” That’s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans, thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens. Now, we all have a heart and we all want to take care of people. But what you’re doing is you’re telling millions of people to pour up into our country. We’re going to give you education. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. We can’t do it. We can’t afford it. We can’t take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security.

While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen and we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the State of Florida. And I have to say, it was practically that way for almost every state in the union. But it was Florida’s best year. The year coming is going to be, and you’re going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So I’m putting myself on the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year we’ve ever had economically.

But as I’ve done from the beginning, I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You haven’t heard that, right? You haven’t heard that from other people. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody could even believe. And if you look at our upward path, no country in the world has recovered the way we’ve recovered economically or otherwise, not even close. And if you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s all we want. We want a normal life. We’ll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well, will reach historic new highs. Highs like they’ve never reached before. Biden would terminate our recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Florida’s economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown. That’s what he-

… his economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. That’s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. And you know what? If you don’t feel good about going out, stay, relax, stay. You know the risk groups, you know the older people. See, fortunately, I’m not an old person. I’m very young and I’m in such perfect shape.

I’m in such great shape. I said that the other day. I said, “Well, I’m very young, and I’m in great shape, perfect shape.” And they said, “Donald Trump misrepresented today, again. He said he was in great shape, that he’s very young.” These people are the sickest of them all.

But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted the Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where they’re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You can’t do that. And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida. You’re open and open for business and doing great.

And we got to remember, I said it right at the beginning, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. The cure can not be worse, but if you don’t feel good about it, if you want to stay, stay, relax, stay. But if you want to get out there, get out. One thing with me, the nice part, I went through it. Now they say I’m immune. I feel so powerful. I will walk into that audience. I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, and everybody. I’ll just give you a big, fat kiss.

No, but there is something nice. I don’t have to be locked up in my basement, and I wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway. I wouldn’t allow it to happen. When you’re the president, you can’t lock yourself in a basement and say, “I’m not going to bother with the world.” You got to get out, and it’s risky. It’s risky, but you got to get out. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something, and now they say you’re immune. I don’t know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean, every time I think about it, every time I hear them, it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible. But it is a great feeling.

I want to thank, by the way, Walter Reed Medical Hospital, Johns Hopkins. These guys are incredible. We’re 90% better now than we were six, seven months ago, in terms of a cure for people that get really sick, 90%. It’s incredible what’s happened. And with children is 99.9%, you’re going to be okay. You’re going to be okay. 99. 9. They have a little better immune systems, we just learned that, better than you have, better than we all have. But we love our children, but we have to get our schools open. We have to get up businesses going back. We have to get our country rolling, and it is rolling. You’re going to see that when the numbers come out.

The Biden virus plan … and you got to remember, he took H1N1, which he always calls in N1H1. He gets it mixed up. I said, “No, Joe. H comes first.” But it’s called the swine flu. Right? And his own person, his chief of staff, said that it was a disaster the way they ran it. A much less lethal problem, but a disaster, the way they ran it, a total catastrophe. It was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says, “I’m going to tell him what to do. But when I locked down China, he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic when I locked down China, which was in January, months earlier than what he said. Then ultimately, admitted I’m right, but then he said, “Oh, he should have acted faster.”

Well, this was months later that he says I should have acted … Nobody acted fast like I did. I also shut down, locked down Europe, if you remember. And the bottom line is we saved millions of lives. When this first came out, if we didn’t do a good job, they predicted 2.2 million people would die.

We’re 210,000. We shouldn’t be at one. It’s China’s fault. They allowed this to happen. They allowed it to escape China. But 2.2 million people would have died. Just remember that, just to remember that, a fact they don’t like talking about. I have such respect for the people of this country, the way they’ve handled it. It’s been an incredible love fest together. That’s really what it’s been. And sympathies from all of us, to those people who, whose family members have died, whose friends … I’ve lost friends. I’ve lost friends.
Thank you. You’re going to love me even more. You’re going to love me even more, because we’re years ahead on vaccines, and they’re going to be distributed very shortly. I mean, frankly, it’s a big political deal going on, where they don’t want it to be before the election. Don’t let it be. But we have great vaccines coming. Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. I mean, we have great, great things happening with the vaccines. I think even greater with the cures and with the therapeutics. And maybe it’s why I’m here with you. Maybe it’s not, I’m not sure. I know one thing, I was very happy to take it, that I can tell you. But through Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, and they’ll be delivered by the military, and they’re all set to go. They’re waiting for final approval. And that vaccine will end the pandemic, but we’re also launching a historic effort to bring your medical supply chains back home.

In 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Rico’s thriving pharmaceutical industry. Remember, they used to have a great pharmaceutical industry. He cut it out. And when he cut it out, he sent Puerto Rico into a nosedive like nobody’s ever seen before. So we’re bringing it all back, and we’re bringing it back to Florida too. We’re bringing it all the way back, taking our jobs away from China. We’re bringing it back from China. I’ll reverse. Biden’s catastrophic decision. We’ll bring it all back. The drug industry’s coming back into Puerto Rico, coming back into, by the way, Pennsylvania, coming back into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, coming back into Michigan, coming back into Ohio. We’re bringing it all back.

Last month, I also announced an additional $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and for Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. My administration’s allocated over $60 billion. And if you look at Florida, where your great governors, your last two governors have been great, your two senators, great. They’re always calling, asking for money, but I guess that’s what they’re supposed to be doing. And I’m always giving it when it comes to Florida. The panhandle got hit really hard over the last two years. We took care of the panhandle. So days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the governor of Puerto Rico. Can you believe that? Right? Wanda Vázquez Garced. And she was so nice. They were also joined by several great Puerto Rican community leaders, [ Jay Rosario 00:00:25:00], [Gabe Ruiz 00:08:02], [Daisy Lopezid 00:25:05], Myra Guzman-Kaslow and candidate for Congress. Dr. Leo Valentina. Please, where are you? Where are you?

I’m not going to say the best, but I’m just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico. You better vote. But I’ll always be fighting for Puerto Rico. It’s very unfair the way they were treated by Democrats. And while Biden will surrender your jobs to China, your country and your fellow politicians, and I have a lot of great ones right here, including your governor.

Wow. We will never allow ourselves to even think about surrendering to the left wing mob. They’re on the run. They’re on the run. Better not have them have a little bit of a victory, because if they have even a little victory, it’s not going to be good.

I’m bringing our jobs back home and putting violent criminals behind bars. I’m working with your political leaders. We’ve also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law. Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins, there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place, but he’s not going to win. He may be the worst presidential candidate in history, and I got him, I got him. It actually puts more pressure on you. If you ran against a great candidate, there’s actually less pressure. You want to know the truth.
No, we want to keep our country great. We’re bringing it to a level that it’s never been. Our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen, no country has ever seen, all made in the USA, rockets, missiles, tanks, ships, the likes of which, jet fighters, bombers, tankers, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. Our nuclear arsenal is the strongest by far in the world, the strongest it’s ever been. And hope to God, we never have to even think about using it. And the way you won’t have to use it is to have it.

At our debate, Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him, not one, and that’s because … And by the way, did Vice President Mike Pence do a great job?
Right? Did a great job. But it’s because Biden and Harris, that’s another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her, nobody. And so, brilliantly, I said he can’t pick her, because nobody treated him as badly. Although I will say this, had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday, we would have had Bernie instead. But I’d rather have Biden, because he’s now alienated the left. He’s alienated the right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for. How about Pennsylvania?

He goes to Pennsylvania. For a year-and-a-half, he’s against fracking. The day he gets the nomination, through a little luck, because she didn’t get out. So she took all of Bernie’s votes, right? But following day, he said, “I’m in favor of fracking.” But he’s not. And it doesn’t matter, because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio, never let them frack. That’s over with.

But can you imagine? And the press, which is fake and corrupt, the press never said … Have you ever heard him asked? No. Have you ever heard him asked once, “Well, wait a minute. For one year, you said there will be no fracking.” And he said it strongly, right? You know, “Read my lips.” Right? To use an old expression, “Read my lips, there will be no fracking.” That didn’t work out too well. So now he goes, and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say, “A billion dollars. If you don’t change that prosecutor, you’re not getting the billion dollars.” And then he goes, “Whoa, the prosecutor was changed.” The prosecutor against his son. Not once have I heard them talking about that question. Can you imagine if we did that?

And on top of everything else, the Democrat Party declared war on our great police and law enforcement. That’s what it is. So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the National Latino Police Officers Association, the Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations, plus all over the country. And when I asked him, “Name one organization, give me one organization.” During our debate, where he was saved by the moderator about four times, he couldn’t answer it. Name one law enforcement organization. He couldn’t name one. Then I said, “Say the words, law enforcement, just say it.” Couldn’t do it. He couldn’t say it.

We’re joined tonight by a great group of people, warriors, really warriors. He came to me a couple of years ago. He said, “Sir, I want to run for governor.” I said, “Ron, I don’t know. Do they know you well enough?” But he was a great defender and a brilliant guy, Harvard, Yale, top of his class, smart as hell. Nobody knows how smart. Don’t tell too many people. He likes to catch you by surprise. But he’s a great, great guy, and he’s been a great friend. I said, “All right, I’ll endorse you.” I endorsed him, and the rest … he went like a rocket ship, and he handled the pressure. And his wife, Casey, is better than him. I’ve been saying it for a long time. Governor Ron De Santis and Casey.

Great guy. Great, great couple. Great, great couple. Smart, brilliant. Sit down, please. Really, they’re a great group of people. Those people are great, and he surrounds himself with incredible people, with the exception, of course, of Representative Matt Gaetz.

Oh, Matt Gaetz. You talk about a warrior, right? Ron, what do you think, huh? Matt Gaetz is a great man, a great gentleman, and what a future he has. I don’t know about swap it, but I think I might. Thank you, Matt. Thank you.. Thank you both for being here. Appreciate it.

John Rutherford. Where is John? John? Thank you, John. Mike Waltz. Mike, thank you. Thank you. Nice couple. Gus Bilirakis. Gus? Gus? Congressional candidate, somebody who’s supposed to be potentially a superstar. Now, we’ve heard that a lot. Sometimes it works out. It’s going to in his case, Scott Franklin. Scott? Thank you. Oh, he’s got the look. He could be. That’s good. That’s good. I hear good things, Scott. Going well? How’s he doing, Ron? He’s doing good? Ron says you’re doing good. Good. You got to win it. Thank you, Scott, very much. Kimberly. Where’s Kimberly? Kimberly? Thank you. I watched you coming in, speaking. I said, “That’s a lot to follow.” Kimberly is great. I want to thank Kimberly.

And finally, we’re joined by a group of amazing supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be …

… supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be voting for us. We have a lot of, a lot of them. And a lot of them in law enforcement, a lot of law enforcement, they were democrats, in some cases they left their party. In other cases, they just said, “No, we’re voting for Trump.” I said, “Why are you doing that?” “We have no choice.” I said, “You’re right, you’re right.” But nobody’s been better to law enforcement than I have. You know when I first came in, we gave away hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment that was in storage. Wasn’t doing anybody any good, it was collecting dust, probably paying rent all over the place. That’s probably why they had it, come to think of it. But look how far that crowd goes back. Hey, hey cameras, will you please? Oh man, look at that. Man. That’s into those hangers. Wow.
You know, these are the real polls. So when did you hear about this meeting, like a day ago, these are the real polls, right? The other guy gets out there and he’s … they work at work and work and 30 people show up. They put them in those crazy circles, right? They only have the circles because that’s the only way they can fill up the room, it’s true. But that’s a fantastic group of people, thank you. Same thing over here. I wish the fake news would turn the cameras. For a long time, I didn’t think the cameras moved that way, but then anytime there was a little sign of problems, they could twist around like a pretzel and I realized they could. But they don’t like to show those crowds, but that is a massive amount. I don’t know how many people are here, but you got a lot. I want to thank you. So this evening, we’re also praying for all of the families on the Florida Panhandle effected by Hurricane Sally. And I will tell you, Ron and Marco, and everybody, I’ll tell you, Rick, everybody’s been calling and calling.

Matt Gates has been going … driving us a little crazy. Matt, you can take it a little easy. But that’s what somebody that’s good is supposed to do, right? You’re supposed to call. But we take care of the Panhandle and we’re doing it at a level that’s never been done before. And I’ve done it, I think I can say right from the beginning, right? I tell the story about Ron DeSantis. He came to see me, he just became governor. “We had a hurricane. Sir, thank you very much for the money you send to the Panhandle in Florida. I appreciate it.” “Good, Ron, good. I hope it’s enough. Good, spend it well.” I get a call like three days later. “Sir, could I see you?” Now, I’m in Washington. I say, “You don’t have to come up, tell me.” “No, no, no, it’s very important. Sir,” comes into the oval office, “Sir, could we have an extra $500 million?” I said, “Ron, will it ever end, Ron?” And one thing I found out, it never ends for the Panhandle and for Ron, but we take care of it, right, Ron? We take care of it.

Great, great people, you have great people. They’re warriors, I’ll tell you. They’re warriors, they’re fighters. We need more people like that, I will tell you. Last month they approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Florida. And I’ll be with you through every step of the rebuilding and you’ll be hit with others. The one thing we know about Florida, you’re very good at this stuff. You get hit by hurricanes and you rebuild, and you rebuild fast, and it’s incredible. I’ve watched, I’ve watched and you don’t want much help either. You’re proud people, you’re incredible people. You put it back together. But we’re there for you all the way. And were there monetarily and we’re there with FEMA. And I think Ron, FEMA’s been incredible, haven’t they, right? Yeah, they’ve been incredible. Thank you to FEMA. We have a lot of FEMA people here, right over there.

We spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden has inflicted over the last 47 years with that ridiculous, dumb thought NAFTA, T.P.P., and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a disaster for our country. China is considered a developing nation. I stopped that. China’s considered a develop … in other words, China, they’re so wonderful they’re developing, isn’t that nice? Now by being a developing nation, they get much more benefits than a nation that’s not a developing. So I said, “Well, we’re a developing nation too, if they’re a developing nation.” And we just won, you know this, we just won seven and a half billion dollars from the World Trade Organization. And from the World Health Organization, I took us out. They said, “Why did you do that?” I said, “Number one, they were wrong on everything.” Although, they corrected themselves today and they said I was right for the lockdowns. But I said, “Number two, why are we paying 500 million a year? And China, which has one point four billion people is paying 39 million a year, explain that?” They couldn’t explain, it was very hard to explain. So I took us out for that and other reasons, okay. So we’ll see what happens with that.

But these are the deals. I could go over hundreds of different things with you and just common sense. I mean, common sense, what we do. Think of it, World Health Organization, we spend … we have 325 million people, we spend $500 million. China spends $39 million and China dominates them. I said, “Doesn’t work that way anymore, doesn’t work that way anymore.” They’ll take us back in so fast at much less money. For decades, our politicians spend trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, and our factory, and our troops back home to the U.S.A. But those dismal days of betrayal and that’s what we were, we were betrayed by our own politicians, whether it was on purpose, or that they were just plain stupid. We’ll come back with unprecedented force if Washington Democrats are allowed to take control again, we can’t let it happen. You have got to get out and vote.

Sleepy Joe Biden, and it wasn’t him, it’s the people that control him. He’s controlled totally. Has put forward the most radical platform in American history, including a plan to eliminate U.S. borders. Oh, that’s wonderful, where’s our border? We don’t have one, just come in, everybody come on in, come on in everybody. If you’re a murderer, if you’re a rapist, if you’re very, very sick with a disease that can spread all over, just come on in. We’re up to almost 400 miles of wall, nobody talks about that anymore. And we now have the tightest, safest border in our country’s history, but we’re up to almost 400 miles, it’ll be finished very soon. And it’s top of the line. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. But by implementing nationwide catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities nationwide, nationwide, they want sanctuary cities, that’s what they want. I don’t even think … I’ll tell you, I know a lot of people in California, they don’t want sanctuary cities. It’s like the politicians want it. I don’t think the people want it.

But they want to suspend all removals of illegals out of our country, whether they’re murderers, rapists, thugs, bank robbers, they don’t care. They want to suspend it. You almost say, where the hell are they coming from? Where does it even … where does the thought process come? It’s demented. It would mean the total nullification of all U.S. borders, overwhelming every city and town in America, including this wonderful place that we all love very much. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be finished and so beautiful, wait’ll you see that. Wait’ll see that. A few more months. We’re doing 10 miles a day. And by the way, Mexico is paying, they hate to say it. Mexico is paying for it. And Mexico’s been great. Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our border. And I said, you have to do that, otherwise we’re going to have to charge you tariffs because we’re not going to stand for it. When people are pouring into our … and we have the worst laws because Congress over the years has made it so weak.

If you’re a soldier and you talk rudely to somebody, they ended up giving you the electric chair, okay? It’s so horrible. Mexico has been great. 27,000 soldiers we have, see, 27. Now the electric chair comment, they’ll put that, “He’s exaggerating. He shouldn’t do that.” They are sick people. But it is true, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our border and you know what, they don’t play games. They don’t let them through. And if they do let them through, we get very angry with Mexico. So Mexico’s been great. The president of Mexico’s been great. We’re putting a border tax on for cars and trucks that go across. It will much more than pay for our wall, starting soon. Remember when the old days we used to say, we’ll build the wall, everybody thought there was no way. It’s one of the largest projects in the history of our country, because you’re talking about a lot of miles, 540 miles. And then we may even add some more into other areas where you probably, you have natural barriers like mountains and rivers, and a lot of other pretty tough areas. But we may even add some more. We’re doing so great with it, 10 miles a day.
 
And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, you’ve been incredible. Some of them are here, they’re very proud people. One thing with the Army Corps, they may build it a little expensive, but you can’t rip that sucker down and it never [ 00:00:44:30]. That’ll never come down. We ended the catch and release ridiculous program where you catch somebody, you take their name, and then you release them. And you say, come back in three years to a court case. And nobody ever comes back, except for the really dumb ones, they come back on occasion. But nobody ever comes back, they’re in our country. They could be murderers and they could be all sorts of problems and we’re not having that. We ended it. We stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including MS-13. Brought them back to their country. We brought them back to their country. We’ve now deported over a half a million criminal illegal aliens, think of that, think of that.

And outside of poorly run Democrat states and cities, you don’t have crime in this country. Our country is doing fantastically. And I call up governors in Portland, and I call up from the state and I call up the governor, as an example, Oregon. I say, “We’d love to send some people to help you out with Oregon and to help you out with Portland. We’ll solve the problem in a half an hour, like we did in Minnesota with Minneapolis. We’ll solve the problem quickly.” Remember Minneapolis was burning down, day after day and I’d call, let us come in, let us come in. Anyway, they finally came in. How long did it take? About a half an hour. Remember the beautiful scene, they lined up. They weren’t socially distanced, but that’s okay. They lined up, then another line, another line. Then they just walk forward and that was the end of that. And I think we’re going to win the state of Minnesota because of it, I think.

Hasn’t been won since 1972, but it’s looking like we’re going to win Minnesota because of it because nobody, I mean what they did. But I give the governor credit, at least, even though it was too long, he let us in. Oregon, we have to send in the troops. We will solve that problem in 30 minutes. We sent in the U.S. Marshals. Recently, when the man, this horrible human being shot somebody and killed them in the middle of the street. Two days went by, three days went by, I said, “Why hasn’t he been arrested?” We sent in the U.S Marshals. In 15 minutes it was all over, 15 minutes. Be so easy to do. I mean, can you imagine these people for years and years, it’s been anarchy in Portland, for years and years. But not for the Republicans. This is why you cannot have the Democrats and that whole philosophy, that whole craziness, you can not have them involved in running your country.

We invested two point five trillion dollars in the U.S. military, including funding to save Tyndall Air Force Base, because who knows Tyndall. Who is … well, not that big a group. That’s not like a big group. I can tell you if you were in the Panhandle, you’d be saying, thank you very much. It was wiped out by the hurricane and Ron called, and a number of people called, and Marco called, Rick Scott called, they all called. They wanted to save Tyndall and we did it. And now it’s brand new, gorgeous, and really moving along well, right? We did a good job there, I think so. We launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years called Space Force, very [important 00:48:02].

For an administration, if you think of it, so not for 75 years, we’ve created a new force, right? The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. So think of it, Coast Guard. And now we just created a new force, first time at 75 years, if I did nothing but that, that’s a big deal. And that’s peanuts, that’s peanuts. Because we built the greatest economy in history. We cut taxes more than any other president by far in history. We cut regulations, which I think is maybe just as important as the taxes, that’s why our businesses are roaring back. We’ve done things that nobody else has done, nobody else has. And these people back here, they don’t even challenge me on it, which is shocking. Usually you think they’d challenge you, even if they’re wrong. I also brought back NASA, the greatest space center, again, in the world. And we passed V.A. Choice and V.A. Accountability for our great vets, right?

And we just got a 91% approval rating, Ron. 91% approval rating by the vets on the way we’re running it, never happened before. That’s never happened before, Rick, never happened before. We killed the leader of ISIS who was trying to reform ISIS because we blew it into oblivion. We killed al-Baghdadi, they were looking for him for years and years and years. Guess who got him? We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many people all over the world, Qasem Soleimani, he’s dead, gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a catastrophe. President Obama give us $150 billion and we’ll give you nothing. Give us one point eight billion in green, in cash. He gave him one point eight billion in cash. That’s when I realized how powerful the presidency is, when you could do that. What a horrible deal.

But we broke the deal, and I’ll tell you probably the first call I’ll get after we win the election will be from Iran dying to make a deal because they’re down 28% GDP, nobody’s ever heard of a thing like that. That’ll be the first call I get. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And every president promised to do it. Every president said they were going to do that for many, many decades. They all were going to do that. Nobody did it because once they got in office, there was a lot of pressure on you not to do it. I could tell you, I was called by every foreign leader, “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do-”

Not to do it. I can tell you I was called by every foreign leader. Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it. I tell the story. I said, listen, tell them, I’ll call them back in a couple of days. Then, I did it. I called him back. Hey, what’s up?

I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they’ve been working on that. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. They couldn’t get anything. Every year, people would fly in, stay, wine, dine, have a good time and leave. Nothing would happen. 52 years. I got it done in one day. Instead of these endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle East and peace without blood all over the sand, and you see what’s happening. In fact, a point that they didn’t report, I’ve been, I guess three or four, maybe now, Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? Four, three. I told a story. I told my wife. Oh, we’re going to have a great time. We’re going to watch television. I just got nominated for the Nobel Prize. And then I turned on the fake news. Story after story. They talk about your weather in the panhandle run. They talk about this. Story after story. No mention. Remember, when Obama got it right at the beginning and he didn’t even know why he got it? It was the biggest story you’ve ever seen. The last administration made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. They’re not enriched any longer. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. He wants to give everything away to Cuba. He wants to give it away to Nicaragua and Venezuela, not going to happen, not going to happen, not going to happen. I stand with the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom.

The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama-Biden Santos steel with Colombian drug cartels. They surrendered the narco terrorists. They surrendered totally gave up to him and that caused illicit drugs and illicit drugs all over this country. Joe Biden even received the endorsement of Colombian socialists, Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M19 Guerrilla organization, and he took it, because you know why, he didn’t know who the hell it was. He said, I’ll take it. I’ll take whoever. And I said, no, he’s a bad guy, Joe. He’s actually a bad guy.

Under my administration, we worked with Colombian officials to seize or disrupt 227 metric tons of poisonous narcotics since April, and we’re doing fantastically in terms of bringing it down, 19% reduction. My heart will always be with the Colombian people and the people from Cuba and the people from Venezuela and Nicaragua and all of the people that are so unfairly treated, and you’ll see a lot of great things happen.

I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever foot forward by a Presidential nominee or candidate. The Biden Plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. You’re going to have nothing left, this crazy new Green New Deal. The Green New Deal. I mean, what’s that all about? Biden’s running mate sponsored The Green New Deal and the Socialist Healthcare takeover. You’re going to have Socialist Healthcare. You don’t feel well? Okay. Go to the hospital. Stay there for about four weeks. They’ll shut down american energy, shut down fracking and outlaw the private health insurance plans of over 180 million Americans who love those plans.

Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He agreed to this with crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s going to surge admissions into our country by agreed number 700%. No, thank you. Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism, and I don’t like to speak too loud, but we’re not doing too badly, are we?

He’ll ban school choice. He’ll ban charter schools and he’ll ban Florida opportunity scholarships, which is a big deal, a big deal. He wants to put him out of business run. In a second term, I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America.

A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And I just have to say in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s ending. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which you’re already doing. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second Amendment.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible and very, very stupid foreign wars against countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed and it takes place on January 1st, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by 50, 60, 70, and even 80%.

We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. Republicans will always protect. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’s going to be very soon.

We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ” in God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida.

So, get out there and vote. Send in your absentee ballot if you’ve requested one. Be very careful, a lot of shenanigans going on. You see what’s happening. Every day you’re reading it. In person early voting begins next week. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You have no choice. You have to do it. True. You got to do it.

We’re going to win Florida big. We’re going to win a lot of states big. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading in Nevada. We think we’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading all over the place. We got to have this be a big win. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Pensacola to Miami, and from Jacksonville to right here in Sanford, we stand on the shoulders of Florida Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes across the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, lay down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and from here in this beautiful state, landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon.

We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We’re returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when Ron DeSantis comes to my office in Washington, the magnificent oval office, and he says to me, sir, sir, the people of Florida, they’ve won too much. They’re getting tired of winning. I’m going to look at him. I’m going to say Mr. Governor, go back and tell them, don’t worry about it. You’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. That’s what they want to do. We’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we’re one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Thank you very much. Thank you.",12/10/2020

Hello, Johnstown. Thank you very much. This is going to be a great evening. Incredible to be back in Pennsylvania, the proud home of American independence, the American constitution and American freedom. That’s true. Huh? What a history. And 21 days days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win. We get ripped off by everybody. If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins, very simple. For years, the selfish and corrupt political class betrayed the people of Pennsylvania, you know that, and the people of our country. Career politicians like Joe Biden lied to you. I don’t think he knew he was even lying. You want to know the truth. He’s gone. He’s shot folks. I hate to tell you, he’s shot. He abused you, he crushed you, your dreams and outsourced your jobs to China and distant lands all over the world.

As a Senator Biden’s last American trade policies were a total disaster. They dismantled your steel industry and decimated entire towns in your area. And we brought back steel and we put tariffs on steel and we stopped dumping steel and aluminum. As vice-president, he closed down 10,000 factories while raking in cash from corporations that moved jobs overseas, and his family got rich. You know that.

How did Hunter make three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Russia, mayor of Moscow’s wife? How did that happen? So you have the mayor of Moscow, got a wife, gave Hunter three and a half million bucks. I wonder what he did for that money, huh? The fake news, they refused to talk about it. They don’t want to hear about it.

Biden’s a servant of the radical globalist, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests, who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories and you know it, because you really suffered right in this area, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They’re all coming back home. Don’t worry. They’re all coming back home, soon. They’re already on their way. They’ve been on their way for a long time.

In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as your president to finally put America first. That’s what we did. And we did not come this far, overcome this much, and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved, Washington swamp. And by the way, did we catch them? We caught them. We caught them. We caught them. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. They spied on our campaign. What they did should never, ever be allowed to happen in this country again, never. Watch what happens. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists like his vice presidential candidate. That’s another great one, isn’t it?

I just watched her on television coming in, because the great thing about Air Force One, we have more televisions. They’re in closets. They’re all over the place. They’re on the floors, on the ceilings. And I watched her and I compared her to Amy, great future Supreme court justice. And I will tell you Amy’s made a great impression.

Fill that seat. Fill that seat. Fill that seat.
 
And you know, Biden, he can’t stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can’t even find his way off the stage without them. Look what’s happened. Yesterday, he didn’t know the name. He said, “You know the guy, I think he’s a Mormon, right”” He said, “He’s a Mormon.” He was talking about Mitt Romney. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine. Then he didn’t know where he was. He said, “Where the hell am I? Where am I?” No, he’s shot folks. He’s shot.

I’m running against the single worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. And you know what that does? That puts more pressure on me. Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this? It’s unbelievable. It’s disgusting. It’s disgraceful. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won’t be running the country. The radical left will take over.

And how about Pennsylvania? So he says, “There will be no fracking, no fracking.” This went on for a year and a half. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So they stole another one for Bernie. Bernie is the greatest loser of them all. This guy, every four years they steal it. So she refused to get out, Pocahontas. She refused to get out. They wanted me to apologize for saying the word Pocahontas. So no, no. I apologize to Pocahontas, [ 00:06:52]. No, no, she wouldn’t get out. And she took enough votes away and Biden won super Tuesday. That shouldn’t have happened.

But if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, fortunately that’s because I’m not a politician. I’m not a politician. But think of that, you talk about politician, no fracking for a year and a half, right? And then he goes to Pennsylvania says, “No, no, there’ll be fracking.” Like nothing happened. Can you imagine if I did that? No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. I’m the opposite, by the way. No fracking, no fracking. Then you win and you go, I’ve got to go a little to the other direction, a little bit to the right. Although he actually went further to the left, which is sort of an amazing thing, but all of a sudden he comes out in favor of fracking.

And let me tell you, it’s always the first thing that turns out to be true. Okay. They will lose, you will lose, in Pennsylvania a million jobs. There will be no petroleum products. There will be no fracking whatsoever. And did you see his party now is really angry at him because he’s saying maybe there’ll be fracking. It’s a very conditional, it’s a very weak, but with me, you’re going to frack. You’re going to frack. And you’re going to keep your energy low. And we’re independent, we are now energy independent, first time ever.

So if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fought harder for you than any president has ever fought for their people. Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that’s a big thing, saving it, because these people, this will end up being a large scale version of Venezuela, if they get in. They don’t have water. They don’t have medicine. They don’t have food. They don’t have anything. Despite everything they’ve thrown at us, we’ve done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in history. And the best is yet to come. That’s true.

A recent Gallup poll just came out.

Thank you. A Gallup poll just came out that found that 56% of Americans say they’re better off today than they were under Sleepy Joe and Obama. That’s the highest of any president at this point in his term. Let’s think of that, 56%. This is as we round the corner on the pandemic, 56%. they were much, much lower. Just remember this, if they were any good I wouldn’t have run for president, but they were no good. They did a horrible job. They did a horrible job.

Yesterday, Biden told those 56% of Americans that they probably shouldn’t vote for him. And for once I agree with Joe. Did you hear? He said, “You shouldn’t vote for me.” He has no idea what he’s saying. How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? Is this possible. Oh, I’ll never come to Pennsylvania again. I love this place. They say he was born in Scranton, but he left. He left. He abandoned you. Give me a break.
I love you, too.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, there’s a lot of people here tonight. Got a lot of people. I wish the fake news would show it. They never turn the cameras. I go home, our great first lady always says, “How was the crowd?” I said, “Didn’t they show it?” “No, they just show your face.” And about five people behind me, right? They become famous. Why don’t you show the crowd though? Why don’t you do yourself a favor, show the crowd.

One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. He’s a liar. Okay. He’s a liar. How do you do it? How do you do it? He went for a year and a half. They said, “Are you…” remember the debates with the radical left Democrats? You had Alfred E Newman. You had all these people, you know who Alfred E. Newman is? Yes. Pete Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, he was a bad mayor of a failed town and he’s going to run for president. Pete Buttigieg, but you know he’s talking about it. And does that mean everybody, nobody is going to do fracking? That’s right. Nobody. Nobody, I swear. Nobody, nobody, nobody. Then he gets up, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life, and not one fake reporter back there said, “Well, wait a minute, you’ve been pledging for a year and a half, no fracking.”
But then what about the healthcare for illegal immigrants? Who in this group is going to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants? Everybody raises their hand. You remember Joe? No, do you remember? This is a famous clip, but they don’t ask him questions about it because they’re fake. You remember Joe? Who is going to provide… And look, we all have hearts and we want to take care of everybody. But you know the problem when you do that, we don’t have the money. The whole world is going to empty out into our country. They’re going to come for healthcare. They’re going to come for college, free college. I say sometimes jokingly sarcastically, “Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce.” To which CNN says, “They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. He has misrepresented.”

These people are sick.
CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks. CNN sucks. CNN Sucks.

Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. The president has misrepresented. They are sick people. But think of it, so remember when Joe and they said, “Raise your hand if everybody’s in favor of free, everything, credit free everything, but free healthcare for illegal aliens.” And Joe goes like, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue. And he’s not a nice guy. Just so you understand, not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn’t hit him like this, but he’s not a nice guy. He’s a bad guy. He’s always been a dummy. He’s never been… No, no. In his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he “would sure, absolutely make it. We will eliminate it.” That’s what he said. Those are the exact words. And then he said it 19 different times.

Then one day he said, “I never said that.” It’s incredible. And they don’t question him. I couldn’t get away with it for a minute, not for a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child. Barron Trump, and actually Barron’s far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall, Lester Holt, Lester Holt. That was a beauty, right? That was some town hall. And they said, “Yes, we have a random sampling of people.” Yeah. All Trump haters. What a group of people. But he raised his hand. He said, “Illegal immigrants will get healthcare.” Now people don’t realize what that means. That means your social security goes down the tubes, your country goes bankrupt. The whole thing is a disaster, but he raised his hand. Now he’s trying to say he didn’t do it. And they don’t call him out because they’re fake.

His radical left running mate, who I just watched on television, she is so pathetic, is a co-sponsor of the socialist green new deal, which eliminates all fossil fuels. She’s having a hard time getting out of that one. Did you hear the other day? She actually came out in favor of fracking. It was like, “Yeah, I think so.” She’s further left than Bernie. Did you see Bernie, I thought was the furthest left in the Senate, because you don’t get too much worse. Then you go, instead of socialists, you go to the C-word, right? She’s further left. She’s considered further left than Bernie. When Nancy Pelosi does the 25th amendment, she’s doing it for Biden. You do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won’t be hard. But at this very moment, Biden’s website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means fossil fuel, coal, everything is gone and it’s gone soon. Okay.

And with that goes our economy, and with that goes our country. The Democrat party hates fracking. They hate coal. They hate clean, beautiful coal. I see what they do with coal now. They hate domestic energy production and Biden will shut you down. He wants to shut you down just like your governor’s got you shut down right now. They better open up your state. Did you see the World Health Organization yesterday? They said Trump was right. They said you can’t make the cure worse than the problem itself. I’ve been saying that for a long time. And we did the right thing. We saved 2 million lives. They said 2.2 million people. We saved 2 million lives and we get nothing, and I’ll tell you what, the vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don’t know what it was. Antibodies, antibodies. I don’t know. I took it. I said, I felt like Superman. And I said, “Let me at them.” No, and I could have been here four or five days ago. It’s great. We have great doctors.

I want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins, great doctors. One great thing about being president, if you’re not feeling 100%, you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with 14 of them. Where are you from? “I’m from this one.” Where are you from? “I’m from Johns Hopkins.” “I’m from Walter Reed.” But what great talented people. They did a great job and thank you. And while I’m president, America will remain the world’s number one energy producer with Pennsylvania workers leading the way and that’s what’s happening. You’re leading the way.

You know, you had the best year in the history of your place. It’s a history of … if you look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you never want to say state. Don’t ever say state. Actually, nobody cares but them, but you know.

I’m just saying, let’s say Pennsylvania, you got two of them. You know that, right? The Commonwealth, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. Probably spent more time here than sleepy Joe in all fairness, I went to school here. But we’re putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments. You see that happening. And we’ve got … Did you see in the debate the other night, I said to him, “Name one law enforcement agency, just one in a whole country that supports you.” He couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, “How come you got the three and a half million from Russia?” And they bailed him out again. He was choking like a dog. They bailed him out.

But they want to dissolve your borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have open borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, get rid of your Second Amendment.

I mean, here’s one that’s incredible, destroy your suburbs. Okay, so they talk about the suburban women. And somebody said, “I don’t know if the suburban woman likes you.” I say, “Why?” But we had this … I love you too.

They said, “They may not like the way you talk,” but I’m about law and order. I’m about having you safe. I’m about having your suburban communities. I don’t want to build low-income housing next to your house. Okay, if that’s okay? And I ended the regulation, the rule that made the zoning so impossible that you had to destroy your communities. And then I hear the suburban woman. I think that the suburban woman, and I used to say suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said, “Does anybody care?” Do you care? If I say suburb? No, they’re all going to no. Again, the only one cares is them. “Trump said suburban housewife,” but I didn’t say it because I don’t. You learn very quickly. You learn very quickly. But suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs and you’re going to live the American dream. And that’s what you’re going to do.

And remember this, 29% of the people experiencing the American dream in the suburbs happened to be minority. And you don’t know that. But 29%. and we’re doing this for everybody. We’re not doing it one way or the other. We’re doing it. And I ended it. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to end it.” It was a horror show. And this loser, Corey Booker is the guy that’s going to be in charge of the program. The guy’s a stone-cold loser. 1%, he got 1%. He ran. He was going to be great. You know, 1%. every week he was like her, down, down, down. They should’ve picked him. But no he’ll be in charge of you’re a suburban …

So can I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay? The other thing I don’t have that much time to be that nice. You know, I can do it, but I got to go quickly. We don’t have time. They want me to be politically correct. Yes, let’s discuss it. Let’s talk about it over the next 10 years. No, no, no, no. We saved suburbia in the US. I got rid of a regulation that was a disaster. And it was very unfair. And you’ve been reading about it for a long time. It’s been going on for a long time. It became much worse under Obama and Biden. I got rid of it. And I had a choice. Even my own people said, “You’d never get rid of it, sir.” I said, “I want to get rid of it.” “Well, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to get rid of it.” Get rid of it. Okay?

And I think we’re going to see that the women really like Trump a lot. That’s happened last time. Remember? Remember last four years ago? Four years ago, they said women will never vote for him. I said, “Why, am I so bad?” They said, “The women will never vote.” Then I got 52%. They said, “What the hell happened with the women?” Except this time, see, this is much easier. Because then I was a developer, I was doing great, everything was nice, but I had never done this before. I came in, I said, “I’m going to rebuild our military. I’m going to cut your taxes. I’m going to cut your regulations. I’m going to get you this, I’m going to get you that. I’m going to take care of our vets.”

I mean, I did things that frankly, I never even talked about like space force. I never talked about space force. The wall is almost built. You know, the wall is up to 392 miles. It’s almost built. And Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, you know that. I’ve been saying it. They hate to hear that, but they’re paying. We’re putting a charge on where the cars go through and it will more than pay for the wall. But we have now the most secure Southern border that we’ve ever had. And I want to thank the president of Mexico. They 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border, stopping people from coming into the US illegally. Thank you very much.

No, but we did all these things. So this time in theory, it should be easier. But don’t forget, I’ve gone through years of a fake witch hunt. And now it turned out that they were the guilty party. They were the ones dealing with Russia. They were the guilty people. Think if I didn’t have every night on that fake CNN, right over there with the light on. The light just went off. It just went off. Every time I point to them, the light goes off. It’s all right, keep it off. Nobody’s watching them anyway.

But think if I didn’t have every night, Russia, Russia, Russia, hey. And nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me. What I’ve done for NATO. Raised $130 billion a year from other countries that weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent, as we said in the real estate business. They were delinquent. And that goes up to $410 billion. Nobody did that. Obama used to send them pillows maybe from the pillow man on Fox. Did you ever see a man advertised so much? I’ve never seen it. I’ve never seen the biggest advertising … I think he’s the greatest advertising genius, Mike. If I gave him our budget, you wouldn’t be able to do anything else but watch Trump ads. The pillow, man. I tell you, I never saw so many ads in my life. Every day, it’s a pillow, the pillow. Now he came out with a sheet and I’m going crazy. That’s all we need now is a new sheet. But he’s on our side too by the way, that guy, he’s on our side, Mike.

And now Biden even refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. You know, elections have consequences. Winning and losing an election, that’s big consequences. And we’ve been winning elections. And they say, “Well, you know, Trump shouldn’t be appointing the new justice because …” well, I’m president. In fact, as you know, a lot of your great justices said, “No, no they’re appointed.” Justice Ginsburg just said recently, not so long ago, “No, no. He’s a president for four years. Not for three years. You appoint …” Now, she was referring to Obama, I think, or Clinton or somebody. But wasn’t referring to me, I can promise you that.

Oh, don’t worry. Don’t worry. It’s being filled. You don’t have to worry about that. That’s much easier than we’ll build a wall that goes to … that goes for a lot. You know, the wall is one of the biggest projects in the history of this country. You know that right? And we had a party dedicated to the proposition that there will never, ever be a wall. They know was the right thing to do. And I made one big mistake. I should’ve come instead of saying, “We will build a wall,” I should have said, “We will never, ever build a wall.” They would have given me so much money. Made a big mistake. All great congressman over there. Are you guys having a good time, by the way? Huh, Mike?

He said the voters don’t deserve to know. And they’ll tell you after the election what he’s going to do. And you know what I did, I gave you a list. I have 45 people on that list. Every one of them is a star. And I gave you a list. Yeah, sit down, everybody. Just enjoy yourself. What the hell? Look at these people. I didn’t even realize you’re all standing. I didn’t realize you had seats. You’re lucky. This is one of the few crowds we provided seats. That’s because it’s Pennsylvania, I guess. It’s pretty good.

If they win, Democrats will pack the Supreme Court with radical left justices who will shred your Second Amendment. You can forget about guns, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals and terrorists. To defend our constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Supreme Court and to the court. She’ll be a great justice of the United States Supreme Court. She’s done so well. I really found it fascinating today. I don’t have too much time, but I tried to watch as much as I could. She was great.

The radical left is hellbent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged. And they are going crazy. Think of it, very many presidents never have anybody to appoint. I will have by the end of the first term, almost 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices. Their heads are exploding. I hope they’re happy.

They want to cancel you, shame you, and persecute you. That’s what they want to do. They want to shame. And this whole cancel culture thing. Now they’re after Abraham Lincoln. They don’t like Abraham Lincoln. No, he wasn’t too good was he? I said this three years ago. Remember when they took down a couple of statues of people you’d never heard of? A Confederate soldier, somebody else, somebody … I said, “Oh, really? Then next will be Robert E. Lee. Then next will be Abraham Lincoln. Then next will be George Washington.” And everybody laughed. They said, “Oh, the president is so funny.” I said, “I’m not being funny. These people are sick.” These people, they want to take away your heritage. And by the way, are there any Italians in the room?

Okay, well, we are protecting the legacy of Christopher Columbus. The Italians are tough. I love the Italians. So they were going to rip down the statue of Christopher Columbus in New York. You saw that, right? And all of a sudden, a group of Italian circled around the statue and they were having pretty tough things in their hand, I must say. And it was amazing how those people that wanted to rip it down disappeared very quickly. So the Italians, let me tell you, Christopher Columbus will always be here on my watch, that I can tell you.

I had people the other day that wanted to wish me Happy Columbus Day. They were afraid. I said, “Why are you ashamed? No, no, say it. Happy Christopher Columbus Day.” This is Christopher Columbus Day. It’s Columbus Day.” So Italians say, “Thank you Mr. President.” I appreciate it. I like you too. I love the Italians. They want to punish the middle-class, expunged every last trace of traditional values, and replace the American dream with the socialist nightmare. And that’s what would happen. Just take a look at what’s going on in other parts of the world.

Biden’s agenda, not that he has one, but you know. He does whatever they tell him to do. He got so lucky. She should have gotten out. She was faithful, she would have gotten out. Bernie would have run. We would have been running against crazy Bernie instead. But I’d rather run against Joe because there’s no enthusiasm. There’s no energy. One thing with Bernie’s people … And you know, we got a lot of people last time from Bernie because they loved me on trade, because they know our country has been ripped off on trade like no country has ever been ripped off. And Bernie’s people get that. And they like us on trade.

Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare. Nobody remembers that. And the press will never bring it up. But he tried to cut your social security. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal health care for the illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about your senior citizens and it’s true. And let me just tell you this. And I say it strongly, and when I first got elected, they always played the social security card. And nothing happened. Your social security now is better than ever. I haven’t touched it. While I am president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s what we want. Normal life. We want normal life. We’ll fully resume. And next year will be one of the greatest economic years in the history of our country. It’s already happening.

How about the stock market? Who has 401ks in the audience? Well, I can tell you one thing, I’m getting all of your votes. I’m getting your votes. Your 401ks is setting records. Think of it, as we’re rounding the turn and we are, they go crazy when I say we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. We understand it. Hey, I just had it. Here I am. It’s actually me.

And I could’ve stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. I could have done that, but I’m the president of the United States. I can’t do that. I got to get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people. And I know it’s risky to do that, but you have to do what you have to do. I’m the president. I can’t sit in the basement and say, “Let’s wait this thing out.” I’m not going to do that. And now I’m immune, they tell me I’m immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I’ll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I’ll kiss him. Not with all of enjoyment, but that’s okay.

Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate the economy with draconian, unscientific lockdowns, like you’re having right now in Pennsylvania with this governor who is killing you. Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf. Come on, Tom. Open up Pennsylvania, Tom. Open it up. You know what’s going to happen? November 4th, they’ll open it up. You know that? They want to keep the numbers as bad as possible.

Here’s the problem. The numbers are going to come out just before the election. So we have November 3rd, the numbers are going to come out. And Pennsylvania is a late voting state. You actually believe in going to a poll because you see all the shenanigans. No, you’re a late voting state. And all I can tell you is when I came here and I said this before, but when I came here, I promise you a lot of things. I’ve done much more than I promised you. You’ve had the best year you’ve ever had, and you’re going to have a better year next year. You damn well better vote for me, Pennsylvania. You better vote for me.

Sleepy Joe Biden’s plan will crush America. And my plan, we’re going to crush the virus very quickly. It’s happening already. It’s happening. Almost 90% less mortality. You know, the mortality rate is at like 85. If you had it seven or eight months ago, it was not as good as if you have it now. And soon it’s going to be perfecto. And I said that the drug that they gave me, we’re going to be distributing it all over the country to hospitals and everything else, because I’ll tell you that sucker works. That’s my opinion. What do I know? But to me it works.

And the people that did it. They’re phenomenal people. They’ve had great success with other vaccines and drugs. Just this week, we learned that another member of the Biden family is getting rich off connections to Joe. His son-in-law, just came out, big story, is cashing in on the China virus pandemic, just like Hunter. Where’s Hunter? Crashed in on China. What do you think when Hunter walks in and he walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. I said to a friend of mine, one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, “Does that ever happened?” He said, “I’m the biggest guy on Wall Street. That doesn’t happen for me.” 10 minutes, he had a billion and a half dollars. Maybe he’s not so stupid after all.

To fight the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. And we really should get credit for what we’ve done, because I’ll tell you Mike pats and all of these people, they have worked 24 hours around the clock. Our early and aggressive action saved as many as 2 million lives. Remember when they said, “No, no, no. You don’t want to ban China. Don’t ban China.” I did it in January. They were talking a month and a half later, we shouldn’t be doing it. He called me xenophobic.

I said, “Joe, give me a definition of xenophobic, please.” He was unable to do that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate by 85%. I’m working with the FDA to make the antibody treatments I received. And everybody … we’re going to have them. They’re going to be shipped very soon. We’re working on an emergency use authorization, very complicated stuff. And the …

Use authorization, very complicated stuff, and the FDA has never responded like they’ve responded to me. This could have taken years what we’ve done and we’ve done it in weeks. I know they came to me on one thing and they said, “Sir, well that will take approximately two and a half years.” I said, “No, it’s no good.” “When do you need it, sir?” “Next week? Tomorrow? How about tomorrow?” No, we’re pushing them hard. The FDA has been great. To everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I felt your pain and we will beat this virus together. Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who’s had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you’re the people I want to say hello to because you are right now immune. You are right now immune.

Or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, “Well, if you have it, you’re immune for life,” right? Once I got it, they give you four months. It’s anybody else but me, you’re immune for life. Through operation warp speed, which is incredible, we’ll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, 100 million, and the vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all.

And remember this because I have the endorsement of, I think, every major law enforcement and minor law enforcement group in the country. We have a lot of Democrats that left their party and they came over, law enforcement people. I can almost tell you by looking. Look at this group over here. I know the law enforcement people. Nobody’s been better. We had all this surplus military equipment. Obama didn’t want to give it out because he said it looked too militaristic. I said, “No, I want to save lives. Okay?” It’s defensive equipment. I want to save lives. And we gave out hundreds of millions of… It was sitting in warehouses all over the country, military equipment, and we gave it out. But there’s nobody like the great men and women of law enforcement. Nobody.

Look at that. Whoa. Whoa. See? They love you. See that? Wow. I didn’t expect that. That’s pretty good.
That’s great. But this election is about law and order. You look at Portland. We keep saying to the governor, “Look, governor, Oregon.” I said, “Governor, let us go in. We’ll solve the problem in 30 minutes.” They don’t want to do that. You know, they’re supposed to ask you to come in. We did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis, except you know, instead of 10 days, they could have called us like two hours later. But they came in and they lined up and they were not socially distanced. They lined up. You saw that. They came in wearing black uniforms, 250, 000 and most expensive uniforms. I never saw so many computers on a helmet. But they went in and they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn’t want us to use anymore. They said, “No, we don’t want to do that.”
These people are a lot of bad people out there. You know, they’re anarchists, radical, left anarchists. Okay? So they came in. They came in. You saw it. There was one person. I said, “Where are the rest?” Then another one. Then another one. Then they started getting off buses, wherever. All of a sudden, you had one line, two line, and they just started moving forward. That was the end of the problem. It ended within 30 minutes. It was over. It was over. And we’ll do it wherever they want us. We’d love to go into Portland because those guys are bad news. You saw we sent in the U.S. Marshals, right? Because one man, horrible guy, shot somebody right through the head, shot him in the middle of the street. A guy who wasn’t hurting anybody. He killed him. Two days went by. Three days went by. I said, “Why the hell haven’t they arrested him?” And they knew who he was. And we sent in the U.S. Marshals. And in 15 minutes it was all over. That was the end of it. That was the end of it.

Biden Harris and the Democrat party declared war on our police. Okay? And we’ve proudly received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association. Wow. The Fraternal Order of Police including those in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton and virtually every single police organization that we know.

And during the debate, I asked sleepy Joe, I said, “ive me one organization, law enforcement, that’s endorsing you.” And he couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace saved him. Then I said, remember I said, ” Sir, tell me, say the words law and order. Say it, Joe. Say it.” He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. Because you know what? Because he’d been run out of his party if he said the words law and order. Then I think at the end, didn’t he say like law, and order, and safety, and justice, and you know, all the stuff. No, no. Law and order. Say law and order, Joe. He couldn’t do it.

So we’re joined tonight by some real warriors, warriors of a different type, political warriors. They’re okay too, right? And they’re friends of mine. They’re great people. Representative John Joyce. John, please. A guy has been around a long time and he fights like hell, G.T. Thompson. G.T., thank you. Great. Be careful with your election. I hear you’re only up 40 points, G.T. Another one is only up about 44 points, a really good friend of mine and he’s tough as hell, Mike Kelly. I say G.T., Mike, you need any help, I’ll come and help you. The say, “No, sir, we don’t really need help. Don’t worry about it.” A friend of mine and a great gentleman, and he was the first one that predicted that I was going to win this thing. I’ll tell you, former Congressman Lou Barletta. Thank you, Lou. Thank you, Lou. How are we doing, Lou? Are we doing okay? How do we compare to four years ago? Better. Okay, good. He said the right thing. Anyway, yeah, I think a lot better, because we produced. Again, four years ago. I said we’re going to do things. Now we’ve done them all plus additional things, I mean a lot of additional things. I never talked about Space Force. We did Space Force. You know, somebody did Space Force. That’s like a major achievement for four years. That’s one thing. That’s like one thing out of so many other things. So it’s one of those things, but I never used to talk about that.

And former chair of the Pennsylvania Republican party, a friend of mine, the guy that knows more about Pennsylvania than any human being on earth, Rob Gleason. Rob, thank you. How are we doing Rob? Good? Okay, good. He said to me another group came down. They didn’t want his advice. They came down from Boston and they put events all over the place and he said, “You’re going to the wrong location.” Anyway, they ended up losing big. Right? But with us, we came to Rob. We say, where do you think the best places are? And we hit. And we agreed with you too. But Rob Gleason has been a fantastic friend. Thank you, Rob, very much for being here. I appreciate it.

And with their help and your help, we are delivering for the American people like never before. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done in three and a half years. No administration’s ever done this the first three and a half years. In my first three years in office, family income increased by $6,000 and that doesn’t include energy, which I think you could double it up. More than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. African American income grew nine times more than it did under the last administration. Think of it. African American income grew nine, not two, not three, nine times more, and these are out of the book. These numbers are out of the book. Real well for the bottom. 50% grew nearly twice as fast as it grew for the top. 1% Hispanic family net worth increased by 64% in a short period of time, 64.

We added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs and we added 15,000 factories, and Obama said “You’ll never produce manufacturing jobs.” Remember? You need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty including over 1 million African Americans, and more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And we’re doing great with both groups and we love them. We love both groups. Thank you. Those are great numbers. After our tax cuts took effect, wages for the lowest income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. Think of that. You never hear that stuff. The big beneficiary were lowest income Americans. My policies have benefited those who need it the most. After the virus came in from China and we had to change. We had to do things. This came out. It was a sudden horrible thing. China should have never, ever let it happen. They should have never let it happen.

We’ve seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation by far, and we’ve seen by far the fastest recovery of any nation. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million jobs, that’s American jobs. That’s the fastest ever recorded. Job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months. Think of this. For the first five months of the Obama Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. So we’re talking about numbers that nobody can even believe. Homebuilder confidence has reached an all time high. We’re in a pandemic. Reached an all-time high. Manufacturing optimism has doubled. Consumer confidence, which just came out, has surged nearly 20%, and small business confidence is now higher than any time in the entire decade proceeding my election. Think of that. And we’re rounding the turn on our pandemic.

We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He made every bad deal in the book. And by the way, if you look at the H1N1, you know, he calls it the N1H1, right? I said, “No, no. H. Here’s the way you remember it, Joe. H comes before I.” And he goes, “The N1H1, whatever it’s called. What was his name again? Or the Senator? Maybe he was a governor.” Yeah, Romney. Romney. “Oh, that’s right. It was Romney.” It’s amazing. You know, amazing. And he gets away with that stuff. You only see it. You only see it on the internet. They never report it. They never report it. They should report it. They’re doing this country a great disservice by not reporting it. But Biden supported NAFTA, TPP, and China’s entry into the WTO, which is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country.

For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of the American worker. He should not be asking for your vote. You should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a rotten job. Okay? Did a rotten job. For decades our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.
Almost done. Syria, we’re gone, except we kept the oil. Does anybody mind that I kept the oil? So we left some troops behind to keep the oil. With Iraq, we’re almost out. With Afghanistan, 19 years in Afghanistan, 19 years, and we’re really serving as policemen. It’s great to be policemen, but they got to have their own policemen. They got to do it themselves. But we’re, we’re bringing them home. We’re down to a very few number of soldiers.

To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s transpacific partnership disaster. It would have been a disaster. Would have destroyed your automobile industry and others. To defend our steel and aluminum workers, I imposed historic tariffs on dumped goods. Remember when they were dumping steel all over the place? You guys were getting killed. Saving those industries from total destruction. And frankly had the plague not came in from China, but now they’re doing well, anyway, had that not come in, you would have had a steel industry that would have been at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. But it came in, but you’re going to be there anyway in a short period of time, unless some stupid person comes along and raises your taxes by four times what they should be, which is what they want to do.

I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible to do. And I withdrew from the job killing Paris Climate Accord. So nice of them to tell us that we can’t use our energy. That was an accord. You know what that was going to? Destroy our country. That’s what that was going to do. If you look at what has happened over the last very short period of time, the progress that this nation has made, you’re not even going to believe it and you’re going to see it. And you would have seen it had the plague not come in because it was all happening. We were at every single record, but now we’re getting close anyway. The jobs are all coming back and the market is almost going to be topping the market from before the plague. And it’s pretty amazing. I will tell you.

Biden has vowed to rejoin this horrible agreement, a death sentence for your state’s energy industry, The Paris Accord. It’s a terrible thing. Unlike Biden, I know my job is to represent Pennsylvania, not Paris. We’re representing Pennsylvania, not Paris. Got a lot of nice people. They can represent Paris.

I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. You know that. We charged them so much. We gave a lot of the money to our farmers, $28 billion to our farmers because our farmers were targeted. Everybody get your money. They did better without even growing anything, to be honest. But we got it from China, $28 billion, and we had a lot left over that went into the treasury of the United States. To defend American workers, earlier today I also signed an order to crack down on Chinese counterfeiters and merchants who sell their fake products all over the United States. They put the name Tiffany, Tiffany. It’s got the blue box, everything. Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany. Isn’t that wonderful? But it wasn’t made by Tiffany.

Biden will eliminate my tariffs on China. He’s already said he’s going to take the tariffs off China. There goes your steel industry. There goes your aluminum industry. That goes everything. Allowing them to plunder without consequence. The one constant in Biden’s platform is surrender. He surrenders. He surrenders whether it’s a China, whether it’s Cuba. How about Cuba? How about the deal they made with Cuba? How bad was that one? I ended it. That’s why both China and the far left are desperate for a Biden win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position. Okay? And you can forget about Pennsylvania. And you know, don’t also forget, your streets will be surrendered to the mob. You know, Republican areas are great. They’re doing great. The crime is at record lows, everything else. These are the Democrats, super liberal Democrat areas.

Unlike sleepy Joe Biden, I will never abandon our nation and I will never abandon its values. My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family.

In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release programs. And I ended. You know what catch and release is? You catch a murderer, you catch a rapist coming across our border, and you release him. Catch, catch him and release him. And you say, “I’m sorry. Three years from now, please come back for a court case.” Nobody comes back. Impose-

Please come back for a court case. Nobody comes back. Imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals. They don’t want any removals. This is what Biden agreed to with crazy Bernie Sanders. When you have people that are in this country illegally, even if they’re murderers, if they’re rapists, no matter what they are, you can’t remove them. We’ve removed tens of thousands of people including MS-13.

It would mean the total nullification of US borders overwhelming every city and town in America, and especially in a place like Pennsylvania. Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone and your safety is gone. Other than that, you’ll be doing very nicely. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be built very soon. It’s going to be finished. We’re going to have the greatest celebration. That was a tough one. That was a tough one. Remember they said, “We don’t need a wall.” They wanted drones, drones flying around looking at the people pouring across the border. They wanted drones. They wanted modern technology. You know what I’ve said often, right? There were two things that will always be around in a thousand years, in 2000 years, all new computers, all new everything. You come up with a new computer. You come up with a new chip. Three days later, it’s obsolete. I would not want to be in that business, but there are two things, a wall and a wheel right? A wall and a wheel. In a thousand years, 2000 years, it’s going to be here. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in more than 75 years, Space Force.

For our great vets. We pass VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought would ever get that done. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi, and we took down 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was all over the place. It was a mess. We took down the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of many American troops, many troops, many people all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead. Thank you. He’s dead.

I withdrew from the last administration’s disaster, Iran nuclear deal. One of the worst deals I’ve ever seen. That’s John Kerry, the guy was totally incompetent. That guy didn’t know what the hell he was doing. He gave him $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash for nothing. I kept my promise, recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, I’ve been trying to get that. And instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East, you see the deals we made? I actually got nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. The press didn’t cover it, but that’s okay.

The press didn’t cover it. I got nominated for three Nobel Peace prizes. I did more in 47 months in Joe Biden did in 47 years and that’s true. Now Biden is pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. He’s going to ruin your energy. He’s going to ruin your state. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions because there’s no money. Biden’s running mates sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people with great private plans. They want to keep it that way. They’re going to outlaw. They’re going to get rid of them.

Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on Jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by more than 700%. he agreed to this. He said, “That’s okay. Let them come in. I got the ban right? Remember the ban. Remember who’s a big deal. I got the ban. I said, “If it’s okay, we have unfriendly countries. If it’s all right with you, they’re not coming into our country. I got the ban. We won in the Supreme court, five to four. I got the ban.” He wants to give up the ban. He wants to let people pour into our country. 700% increase opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I don’t want to speak too much. Made of wood. This is real wood. I don’t want to speak too much, but you haven’t seen too many things happening lately have you? He’ll ban school choice, charter schools and Pennsylvania opportunity scholarships. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. It’s so important.

A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans and in conclusion and I love being back with you in Pennsylvania. So many incredible memories really. So many. What a night that was. Remember that night? Donald Trump has won the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump. Remember how late? They just didn’t want to call it. They didn’t want to call it. I said, “Call it already.” We were at 98%. We were substantially ahead. If I lost every single vote, we still won. It took him like till two o’clock in morning before they called it. In the meantime, Wisconsin came in and Michigan came in, but they just refused to call Pennsylvania. They just couldn’t. Remember them crying and they were all stirred up.

Over the next four years. We’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already happening. We’ll hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities that people don’t want. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. We’ll strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign ridiculous wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military mind and we will ensure peace through strength.

And by the way, we’ve rebuilt our military. I told you $2.5 trillion. We have weapons and equipment, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. We are the envy of everybody. There is no country that has what we have. And I will tell you when I first came here, one of our generals highly overrated said to me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” That’s where we started. And now we have the greatest weapons anywhere in the world. And just hope to God, we never have to use them.

We will then surprise medical building, require price transparency which is already signed January 1, it kicks in, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs. And I’m talking about 50, 60, 70, 80% because of what I’ve done with favored nations, getting the lowest price Mike, the whole world. We’re going down. We’re taking these nations. They pay a fraction of what we pay. I said, “Nope, whatever they pay, I want to pay.” Why are we paying more than any other nation? We’re the highest. We’re going down to match the lowest. The drug companies don’t love me too much just in case you haven’t heard. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. We’ll always protect patients with pre existing conditions.
 
America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and we’re very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. It’s very important. So get your friends. Most important election we’ve ever had. Get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote like you’d never voted before.

Places that we won like Erie. Places that we won, you got to get out and vote because from Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and from Allentown to right here in Johnstown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of what you have in Pennsylvania. Who can say that? This is it. What you’ve done here, what the history of this incredible place, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, think of what you’ve done.

It’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge and General George Washington… Don’t worry. His statues are not coming down. Led his man on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our nation was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel, that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you have seen nothing yet. Wait till you see what we’re doing. We are making our country greater than ever before.

Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when you’re great Congressman to come to see me, right? It’s great. What a group of warriors. I don’t know with them. I’m not sure I can handle that group, but when they come in to see me in the Oval Office, they say, “Mr. President, Pennsylvania is not used to winning this much. We got to slow it down a little bit.”

And I’ll say, “Mike, I’m sorry. Mike, you tell the rest of them Mike. We’re not going to slow it down at all.” Pennsylvania wants to win more than anybody in this country wants to win. Pennsylvania is going to win. We’re never going to stop. We’re going to keep on winning. We’re going to win so much you’re going to love every moment of that era. And you know what? You lost long enough. I can tell you that. Many years where your factories in your plants left because we have stupid leadership. Don’t kid yourself. You lost for a long time. And now you’re winning and you’re winning like never before. Open it up Governor. Open it up.

Because we’re one movement, one family, one people, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much Pennsylvania. Thank you. Get out and vote. Vote, vote, vote.",13/10/2020

Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello, Des Moines. Oh, it’s been a good time we’ve had in Des Moines. I even brought a hat. They said, “Sir, it is so windy out there.” I said, “Well, my hair is very powerful. It’s very strong. It can handle it.” But I bought it just in case. It may get pretty bad. But it’s pretty windy. So thank you all very much. And I’m thrilled to be back in the American Heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking Iowa patriots. And 20 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to keep it going.

And I must tell you, I’ve just looked. The poll just came out. We’re up six. Okay. Big deal. Didn’t we win by 11 or something. We’re up six. And if I’m up six, nobody has ever done for Iowa and the farm belt and the farmers and all, no more estate taxes, no more anything. I saved ethanol. Ethanol is saved. For me to only be up six, I’m a little bit concerned. I’ll tell you that. There’s nobody’s going to do for Iowa what I did for Iowa. We’ve just learned through, explosive documents, published by a very fine newspaper, The New York Post, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings.

And this is a big smoking gun. The newly uncovered emails reveal that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company, it’s an energy company which paid Hunter at least $50,000 a month, but it’s now looking like it could be $183,000 a month. That’s a lot of money. Would anybody in this audience take it? I’ll take it. We’ll take it. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience, knew nothing about energy, wrote to Hunter arranging for a meeting to meet with Vice President Joe Biden. I’ve been saying this for a long time with that family. The same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an email saying, “We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence.”

In other words, Hunter was being paid for access to his Vice President father, who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia. How about the Russia hoax? It turned out that they were the ones that did the Russia hoax. It was them. No collusion. No collusion. These emails show that Biden’s repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie. It was a total lie. He lied to you over and over because he’s trying to cover up a massive pay for play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency. And everybody knows it. Everybody in Washington knows it. We’ve known it for a long time. The fact is there was never an administration more corrupt than the Obama Biden administration. There was never. Never.

Just weeks ago, Joe stood before the American people in a presidential debate and told you that these claims had been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong. But now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician who shouldn’t even be allowed to run for the presidency. I was pressing Joe Biden to tell the truth because the corrupt lame stream media, right back there, all those cameras right back there, they’re corrupt. And they refuse to write the story. There wasn’t one time in almost four years during my presidency, during the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, a witch hunt, a horrible, horrible, disgusting witch hunt that should never, ever happen to another presidency again, and people should pay for the crimes they committed.

Which turned out to me at total illegal hoax that false and libelous stories every day, false and libelous stories, and they knew they were false, too. They knew they were false. They were never taken down by Twitter or Facebook or the mainstream media. Never once. Yet with Biden today, they take negative posts down almost before they even go up. They’re trying to protect them. They’re trying to protect Biden. They take them down. And I was just getting off that magnificent plane behind us, Air Force One. And I had heard, and I just don’t know this for a fact, but they say Kayleigh McEnany, you know Kayleigh, right? Kayleigh McEnany. Good Kayleigh. She’s so great. She’s incredible. They closed down her account. She’s the White House Press Secretary. Because she’s reporting the truth, they closed down her account. So let’s see what’s going to happen.

And did you hear the news? Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. Bruce Ohr. Him and his wonderful wife, Molly. She wrote all this stuff. And then he goes and he works at Department of Justice and he took it, didn’t he bring it to the FBI? The wife writes that she gets paid a lot of money. Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. That’s good. Couple of years too late, that’s all. He should be not only in the Department of Justice outbox, he should be someplace else, okay?

Eight months after his alleged meeting with the Burisma executives. So these Burisma, Burisma, they say, pronounce it Burisma, a real beautiful company, Vice President Joe Biden went to Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for. That’s Burisma. The documents also show that before one of Joe’s trips to Ukraine, Hunter emailed his business partner saying his lucrative contract should begin now. Think of that. Should begin now, right now. It’s got to begin. The whole thing is so incredible. Here’s a guy, look, let’s just put it in simple language. He got thrown out of the military. That’s unfortunate. He didn’t have a job for a long time. His father becomes Vice President, and he’s making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Think of it. No, think of it. Think of it.

It’s like the Hillary stuff, the crooked Hillary. And it’s the crooked Joe. You know, when a Democrat voter here in Iowa asked Joe last year, you remember, if his son raked in money in exchange for providing access, Joe pulled that man a damn liar. “You’re a damn liar.” Kid’s making millions of dollars. He had nothing. He didn’t have a job. Thrown out of the military, sadly, but thrown out of the military. And he knew nothing about energy. He knew nothing about investments. Knew nothing about China. How about he walked away a billion and a half dollars to manage for China? They don’t do that with the most brilliant people on Wall Street.

Vice President Biden, you owe the people of America and apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician. Okay? Joe Biden must immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings, influence panelings around the world, including China and including Russia, including Russia. Hunter raked in a fortune from China while Joe Biden was giving China all of our jobs. We know where they came from, Iowa and plenty of other places, but they came from Iowa. He was giving them. They were taking our jobs. They were taking our factories. They were taking everything. They were taking our wealth. And I gave you $28 billion. Say, “Thank you very much, President Xi.” It came right out of China. And because of that, everybody’s happy in Iowa. I just hope you remember that on November 3rd. Hope you remember. Nobody else would have done it. Nobody else would have done it.

The Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation, flying around the globe, collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries. In fact, the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden a check for $3.5 million in cash while his father gave away the store to Russia, including Crimea. Remember Crimea? The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. By contrast, and this is so true and so easily true, and I’m so proud of it in so many ways, I’d given up billions of dollars to serve as your President and it’s my greatest honor of a lifetime. It’s so true.

Where’s my hat?
I ran for President because I could not sit back any longer and watch the terrible injustices being done to the American people. And it’s true. And by the way, before the China plague came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now it’s going right back there. Our stock market is very close to a number that was even higher. Does everybody have your 401k ready? Because it’s going through the roof. We’re going to have the best year we’ve ever had, and we’re going to have tax cuts not tax increases. They want to increase your taxes. They want to increase your taxes so they can spend it on the green new deal. That’s another beauty.

I can not sit idly by and watch career politicians like Joe Biden continue bleeding this country dry. And that’s what it is. You know, you can say whatever you want. You can say whatever you want, but when you have a kid that follows his father, and by the way, take a look at his brother, his brother, all of-

… who is his father? And by the way, take a look at his brother. His brother, all of a sudden is building a big housing development in Iraq. “Have you ever built a development before?” “No, I haven’t.” Take a look at the whole family, it’s a corrupt family. Joe Biden, personifies the selfless and corrupt globalist who got rich and powerful at your expense. Take a look at the people that are funding his campaign, people assumed that they’d be funding my campaign, I don’t want them, we don’t want them, we never needed them, we don’t want them. But they betrayed American workers, disparaged American values and crushed our middle-class. For decades, Biden and his cronies laughed while they shipped millions of your jobs to their friends in foreign countries, in countries that you’ve never even heard of. They live behind gated walls and they flooded your communities with illegal immigration, deadly drugs, MS-13 savages that assault, rape, and murder innocent Americans.

They forced our fellow citizens to live in crumbling inner cities while they spent trillions of dollars on never ending foreign wars, they just never ended, but we’re bringing all our soldiers back home, you know that, we’ve been doing it for a long time. And it’s not easy, the military industrial complex, not the easiest thing, but we’re bringing them back home. We’re almost finished in Afghanistan, coming in, we’re dealing… We’re down to a small number coming home by the end of the year, hopefully the end of the year, shortly thereafter. In Syria, we’re out, totally out. And by the way, we crushed, before I did this, we crushed 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%, we crushed 100%. We have the greatest military in the world, and by the way, we have built the greatest military in the world.

So, I just tell you from Iowa, you’re a very powerful state, politically, you’re a big state to me, big in your heart, but you have a tremendous influence and a tremendous power and you’ve never let me down, you just came in and we won by so much. They say if a Republican wins by one point… I think I won by 11, right? 11. That was early in the night, remember that? They said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa.” Then they said, “Man, he went by 11 points, what’s going on?” That was just the beginning. Then we won Ohio, we won Ohio by eight points, I said, “What’s going on?” It’s one thing you want to say, but when you wouldn’t buy a lot, and that was the beginning of something. And I’ll tell you what, we have more enthusiasm now than we ever did four years ago, that really is true.

And we have great poll numbers, although you see a lot of the fake poll numbers they’ll do anything they can to call suppression pools. There they go. Look at the red lights, they start to go off as I start to put… In one way they want the ratings, in another way they don’t want to have the ratings and you’re telling CNN that they’re a fraud in their broadcasting. That was one of the greatest evenings ever. There were those who say it was the most exciting evening in the history of television, highest rated evening in the history of television. And, you know what? The election we have coming up on November 3rd is actually more important. In 2016, you voted to fire the failed and decrepit political class and you elected an outsider as your president, and I finally put America first, it’s called Make America Great Again.

Oh, that feels so much better, that feels better, that feels good. Now, we can all just relax and have a good time. No, but it’s great to be with you. Seriously, we’ve had a great history here together, what we’ve done for you, and what we’ve done for the farmers, and what we’ve done for everything. Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, right? Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country, and the largest order of beef, but you know why? Because China wants to keep me happy, that’s why. It was from China, because they know what they’ve done to us should never have been allowed. They could have stopped it, they didn’t stop it, they should have stopped it. The only reason I’m your president is because the previous administration did a poor job, so poor, in fact, that I said, “I’m going to run for president.”

And you know what? If they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. And if they did a good job, I guess, I wouldn’t have won, when you think, I wouldn’t have run and I wouldn’t have won. But they were so bad, and it turns out there was so totally corrupt. We did not come this far to overcome this much and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the deprived Washington swamp.
When I would say, “Drain the swamp,” I used to say it, “Drain the swamp,” and people liked it, I hated the expression, I hated it. I just said, “This is a hokey expression.” And I put it on one speech the place went crazy, I said, “I’m starting to like that expression.” Then I put it in another speech and they went crazy, I said, “I really like it.” But when I said drain the swamp, I had no idea the swamp was that dirty, that disgusting, and that deep, it’s true. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, thank God. And I don’t want to insult our great politicians because you have some great ones with us tonight. But if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than… And I’ll tell you what, I fight for you harder than any president has ever fought for anyone, it’s not easy. But I love it because we’re making tremendous progress.

And the fact is that, no administration in their first three and a half years has ever done as much as this administration has done, you take a look at the last ones. And it’s amazing because they challenge you on everything, they never even challenge me on that statement. I make that statement all the time, they just stand there and they say, “[ 00:35:23].” They grit their, they say, “He’s right.” “We might hate him, but,” they say, “he’s right.” Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy, and save our country from the radical left, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. As a candidate, Joe Biden has made yet another corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists, and Marxists, and the lunatic left-wing fringe that are really running that party, he’s not running it. Let’s face it, Joe is shot, okay? Whether you like it or not. We can all be nice. It’s going to be my turn someday, it’s even going to be your turn someday, my friends, someday. But you know when it is your turn, you can’t be president.

One thing I’ve learned, President Xi of China, he’s a 100%, Putin of Russia, 100%, Kim Jong-un… By the way, whatever happened to that war we were supposed to be in? Kim Jong-un of North Korea, 100%. These people are sharp and they’re smart, Joe has lost it. In his best day, he wasn’t a smart man, everybody he knows that. But Joe has gone. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country, they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they get it. We’ll never be the same country and we will never be able to recover. And we are on a basis… And I’ll tell you something, the country was coming together. I was telling a very, very, actually a very good reporter today, that our country was coming together because we were having such success that I was being called by people that normally I wouldn’t be speaking to too much, they don’t want me, I don’t want them.

But we had the best employment numbers in history, African-American, Hispanic American numbers, women, Asian, everything, high school diploma, without high school diploma, colleges, PhDs, we had the best numbers in every category, 160 million jobs, we were never even close to that, we were at 160 million jobs. And it was all coming together, people let’s get together, let’s talk. It’s like splitting up the riches, really, and in a positive way, splitting up the riches. And what happened is, we then got hit with the plague and now it’s back to the drawing boards, but we’re going to have a strong V the quarter, the third quarter is going to be incredible when you see the numbers. Not that I know anything, because I don’t want to give you inside information because I don’t have it. They’ll say, “He’s giving away inside information,” they are sick. But wait till you see the third quarter numbers, and it’s going to be right before the election, before the November 3rd, although a lot of people will have voted by that time, get out and vote, you got to get out and vote.

But we were really coming together because that’s… Look, ultimately, we want to come together, everybody come together. And we were really coming together and then we got hit by this horrible situation, could have been stopped. China stopped it from going into the rest of China, but they didn’t stop it from coming out and going to Europe, and the United States, and the rest of the world, 188 countries. So, we’re now putting it together. We had it done and now we’re doing it again, and next year will be even stronger than last year. Last year was the best year we’ve ever had, and this coming year will be even better than last year. Unless somebody comes along and says, “Let’s quadruple your taxes,” which is what they want to do. They want to raise your taxes. They want to go with this ridiculous Green New Deal, which by the way, their original price, a hundred trillion, you couldn’t do it for that. If we did great every year for a hundred years, everything was perfect, right? No nothing, no recessions, no anything, you couldn’t make a hundred trillion dollars. These people are crazy, and they actually mean it. So, we’re going to get it going to a level that nobody can ever turn course on us, nobody can ever change. I tell the story for years as a student of economies, I just love it, I love watching it, I love doing it, and I love seeing the results because the results have been so incredible. But as a student, I used to hear for years, for 10 years, 2019 China… Because look, let’s face it, China is 1.4 billion people, we’re 325, not including illegal immigrants that are in the country, frankly. And we don’t even know what that number… I said, “How many do we have?” “We have no idea, sir.” Well, I have an idea… By the way, our Southern border is now stronger than it’s ever been. But we have 325, 330 million people. But for years I heard that China will overtake us as the world’s largest economy in the year 2019, you’ve all heard it, I think, right? Yes? He’s a very smart looking guy, you’re loaded with money, I bet, look, that’s why he’s in the front row.

He’s in the front row and he didn’t have to stand there for three days to get there, I could tell this guy. But, right? 2019 that China was going to overtake. Well, you go back six months, seven months, not only weren’t they overtaking we were beating them by leaps and bounds and getting bigger and bigger, and growing and growing, and taxing them and taxing them, and taking in billions and billions in tariffs. And when they targeted Iowa and the farmers of this country, and ranchers, and others, I said, “No, you can’t do that, no, you can’t.” And I put a 25% tariff on everything and I gave a lot of the money… I don’t want to say it too loudly, 28 billion, I gave you 16 and 12. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, loves… He knows more about farms. I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” He said, “Two years ago, sir, 12 billion they hit us 4. And last year, 16 billion.”

I said, “That’s okay. We’re going to put a 25% tariff, the farmers are going to get 12 billion and then they’re going to get 16 billion, okay? And we’re going to give that money to our farmers.” And that got our farmers even. In fact, I shouldn’t tell you this because they don’t like this, but some of the farmers were making more money the way that Iowa was doing than by working their asses off, all right? They were very, very happy. But no, we took care of our farmers, no other president is going to do that. No other… That’s why China got away with all of these stuff for years. And we had plenty of money left over after the $28 billion, it went into the US treasury. But they got away with it because they had threatened a president like Obama, we’re going to target your farmers, we’re going to target the middle of our country, and Obama would say, “We better not get involved.” I said differently.

I said, “If you do it then what we’re going to do is we’re going to tariff your goods away, give a lot of that money to the people that you’re targeting.” And the thing that most impresses me about Iowa, Nebraska, and a lot of other States, if you look… By the way, Minnesota was so great, all of them, every one of them, Wisconsin was incredible. They never came to me and said, “Sir, you can’t let this happen. They’ll stop re-ordering, they’re not ordering from us.” They never said it. You know what they said, “The president is right, at some point we have to put up a stand.” And I didn’t hear one even from fake CNN, they put people on television that said, “I know it’s not good, but the president is right.” You did the right thing. Because otherwise, it puts me in a bad negotiating position, you can’t really negotiate, it’s tough. I’ll never forget that about the farmers, it’s incredible. The other thing I won’t forget… You don’t mind if I go off script, this stuff is…

Enough with crazy Hunter Biden and making millions of dollars a day, he made it because of his great intellect. No, but you know the other thing… Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter here tonight, by the way? Hunter, congratulations on making a lot of money last year. The other thing I remember in the White House, we had 36 farmers come to see me, I’ll never forget it. And they were getting hit really hard, this was two and a half years ago, early. And they came in to see me, almost all farmers, and they said, “Sir, we’re hurting, but you’re doing the right thing, sir.” I’ll never forget this meeting, it’s early… I’ve pictures of it. Many from Iowa, but from other states, but many from Iowa. And I never saw… Because everyone’s always asking me for money, “I want money here. I want… Countries want money.” Our so-called allies are always asking for money, ” Please defend us.” Even though… And then they rip us off on trade. We defend them and then they rip us off in trade, they’re always asking for money.

So, the farmers are in, and I said to them, “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to do a big thing, I’m going to get you a lot of money and I’m going to do for tariffs, and I’m going to do this to…” This is very early on in the strategy. “And I’m going to subsidize you guys, you’re going to be so happy.” And I used a terrible word. They said, “Sir, may I speak?” “Yes, you can. What do you want to say?” “We don’t want subsidy, sir. All we want is a level playing field, we don’t want anything. All we want…” It’s true, right? It’s true. I never heard that. Most people, they don’t care, call it subsidy, call it, give me cash, just give me money, the farmer said, “We…” And by the way, I could see there was a chill in the room when I mentioned that word. I said, “Did I say something wrong?” The farmers are unbelievable, they’re the heart of this nation. They said, “We don’t want subsidy.” I’ll never forget it.

“Sir, we don’t want subsidy, we don’t want that. We just want a level playing field, sir. We’ll beat anybody. We want a level…” And it’s to this day… I tell that story all the time, because I don’t hear that, most people they don’t care you can call it anything you want, you call subsidy, you call it anything you want. I just think you people are incredible, okay? That’s it. Enough of that or I’m going to make him cry, and he hasn’t tried in 40 years, that guy. One of the most important issues for Iowa is the whole thing that happened with ethanol, they were killing ethanol, and Joe Biden has vowed to abolish fossil fuels, he supports all of the outside… This crusade to eliminate gas powered cars, and his running mate sponsors the insane… She’s the most liberal… By the way, did Mike Pence beat her [ 00:46:36]? The expression in boxing or as my friend, Dana would say, UFC, if that were a fight, they would have stopped it, right? We love Mike Pence and he loves Iowa too, he loves Iowa, he just left. The Biden-Harris platform will demolish Iowa ethanol, you know that, wiping out the entire industry. And we fought hard for it, we went through the whole thing where we had no demand because of the pandemic and we all fought hard to keep it going and keep the ethanol going. And we did the 12 months… I did 12 months, remember it was eight months, I said, “Why not 12?” And they couldn’t give me a very good answer. But I made it year round and 15%, right? Up from the 10, 15%, and it’s great stuff. And when the market comes back, which is coming back, but in the meantime you have inexpensive gasoline, that’s not so bad, right? There’s nobody who ever thought they’d see gasoline with a two in the front of it and less, and we’ve saved all of our energy jobs.

And whether we like it or not, when we are having problem with energy, I called Russia, and I called Saudi Arabia, and they reduced production by more than 10 million barrels a day and our entire energy was saved all over the world, frankly, they’re not doing it for us, but they’re doing it for, let’s say, everybody. And we have an incredible country and we saved our energy industry, our energy jobs, and we are energy independent, and it’s a beautiful thing. And by the way, I also made a little promise most of you won’t understand, for those people in the ethanol world, you can use the pumps, okay? Do you understand that? You can use the pumps. In other words, you don’t have to go out and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new pumps. Because with the additional ethanol, the additional power, some people say, “Oh, make them buy new pumps.” No, I don’t want you to buy new pumps, you don’t have to.

So, for those people that understood what I just said, you know what I’m talking about, right? Using the pumps, that’ll be okay. To defend our rights in our constitution, I nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Right? And I’ll tell you, I don’t mind running against sleepy Joe, but I wouldn’t want to run against her right now. She has to promise… Please promise me, Amy, you’ll never run. Now, she’s been great, she’s so outsmarting these people with bad intention. You look at some of the questions that are being asked and you… It’s so obvious, these are not great chess players. Let’s face it, they’re not great, but they’re horrible, just horrible, nasty, and she handles it like nothing. She’s a great intellect. And one of the reasons she is a highly respected professor who’s been teaching for many years, I said she was the single greatest student that he’s ever had, and that sold me. I believe in that kind of thing, it’s called intelligence, I believe in intelligence. But I just want to… I haven’t spoken to her in a few days, I want to just say that we made the right choice, right? With Amy. And speaking about making the right choice, you made the right choice a long time ago with a man named Senator Chuck Grassley. And you made the right choice and you’re going to do it again, I hope, because she’s great, Joni Ernst. And they’re right now in Washington fighting to confirm our great new justice, our future justice of the United States Supreme Court. Joni has been fantastic and she’s been for Iowa values for a long time. She’ll call me, “Sir, can we do this?” Nobody called me more on ethanol than Joni and Chuck. In fact, I used to duck their calls, “Just tell him I’m not in. I can’t take it anymore, Joni.” But that’s what a good Senator is, they want to keep your state going, they want to keep our country going, they love our country, they love our state that they represent.

So, Joni Ernst, you got to get her in. And Chuck Grassley, we don’t have to worry about him, he’ll be around forever, he’s great. You know what I love about Chuck Grassley? He’s got that voice, that great voice. Even when he’s being nice, he sounds like the toughest guy, right? And he’s being nice. And he looked at Comey, remember? The corrupt FBI director.
And he looks at Comey, corrupt guy, and he just said, “Did you leak?” And Comey joked, “Yes, I did.” He said in the House, and let’s see what happens to him. But I’ll never forget Chuck Grassley, and he didn’t mean it to be mean, he just sort of got that rough voice. “Did you leak?” “What? Yes, I gave it to my college professor friend from Columbia.” Remember that? We love Chuck, what a piece of work he is. If Democrats win, they will pack the Supreme Court with radical left judges who will shred our second amendment. And believe me, if they win, your second amendment is gone, okay? They’ll empower violent mobs and shield deadly criminals and terrorists, it’s very simple. Joe Biden refuses to even answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. How about this? They go up to him, “Do you want to pack the court?” “I’m not going to answer that question.” You know why? Because they don’t ask it if he doesn’t… Me, it would be like… Forget it.

But they say, “Are you going to pack the court, sir?” “I’m not going to answer that because I don’t want to say.” “Oh, okay, good. Next question.” No, can you believe it? This is the essence of our country, we can’t allow this to happen. And the other thing is, they don’t ask the second. I put up a list of 45, great, brilliant conservative, in our case, justices that go by the constitution as written et cetera, okay? So… He’s got to put up the name of justices or judges, whoever he’d pick to become a justice of the Supreme Court, he’s not doing that, they’re not asking that question, they don’t ask. Did you see the NBC thing last week where they had an NBC town hall? It was designed for a child, okay? When I get in, they ask me things that nobody ever even contemplated could be thought of. This guy, they’re asking him these questions, nobody can believe it. In fact, NBC took a lot of heat, they took a lot of heat.

Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Iowa seniors, everybody knows that. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare, do you remember that? You do know he wanted to cut your social security and your Medicare. Now, Biden…

… cut your social security and your Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. And the problem is we all have a heart. I say it all the time. I’d love to take care of everybody all over the world. The problem is our country can’t afford it. And if you start saying we’re going to give free education. We’re going to give you Medicare. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. Our country will be flooded with millions and millions of people that are going to come from all over the world. They will decimate our country.

You can’t do it. Biden cares more about illegal aliens that he does for your senior citizens. It’s true. I remember when they asked the question at the debate where the Democrats were up there. You had all these Democrats, they started off with 26. And in fact, I said, “There’s no way they pick Kamala because she treated him worse than anybody else and her poll numbers were dropping like a rock, right. But they asked who is going to give money, healthcare to illegal aliens? And they all raised their hand. Remember Joe, he’s looking around. He didn’t understand the question. He didn’t.

At least he has an excuse because has no clue what the hell they’re asking. But do you remember his position? He was like this. Their hands are all up. We’re going to give all our money away. Forget about all your people. That’s a big crowd by the way. Look at that. Show it. Show it please. Turn those cameras, please. That’s a beautiful crowd. That’s beautiful. But remember Joe, so he’s standing there. He’s going to give healthcare to illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, in other words, right. They come in illegally and under a plan, they have the manifesto. They want to give them a lawyer. That’s what we need is more lawyers now, okay. They want to give them a lawyer. They want to give them education.

They want to give them healthcare, but they asked the question and I said, “Wow,” because I think they had like 26 people originally, but every one of them raised their hand including Sleepy Joe. And what happened is Joe’s like this, everybody other hand, and Joe, you could se he’s… For 47 years, he’s got the itch because he knows this isn’t going to work. He’s saying to himself, because you know there’s still something left. Not much, but he’s saying to himself there’s a natural instinct, right, a political instinct. And his shoulder went up and then his hand so I don’t know. I don’t think I’m even going to hold it to him. I’m not going to hold him. I got enough. How about the no fracking?

We will not frack. Do you understand me? We will not. Then he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania where they are reliant on energy and fracking and the jobs, probably 900 to a million jobs, right. Goes there the day after he says he’s not fracking. He says, “We will frack. We will frack.” And they don’t hold it to him. If I ever did that, it would be the end, but never going to be the end for us either, is it? You know that. Never going to be the end because we have something going that nobody has ever had going. We have a relationship with the people that nobody’s ever had. Not because I do think I’m a nice guy. A lot of people, they say suburbia, the suburban. I’ve saved the suburbs. Okay, I’ve saved the suburbs. Then I heard I’m not doing well with suburban women, okay.

I got rid of… No, it’s true. They say that. But of course they said that last election too. He will do terribly with women, terribly. And then when I did great with women, they said, “Man, he did well with women.” Same thing’s going to happen. You know what I find? Suburban women, period, they want security. They don’t want their home values going down. They don’t want a low-income housing project built in the middle of suburbia next to their house. And we have a rule that’s a disaster. It’s a regulation, and I said to Ben Carson, and some people, I say, “I want to terminate.” They looked at me. They go, “Well, we can amend it.” I said, “You don’t understand. I want to terminate it.” You all know about it. It’s a disaster where they change the zoning and they make it impossible and you end up with low-income housing all over the place.

And remember this, 29 to 30% of the people living in suburbia are minorities. So this has nothing to do with discrimination. It has nothing to do with anything. What it has to do is with the American dream, the American dream. We’re not going to destroy the American dream for stupid people like Cory Booker. He was putting Corey Booker in charge. How about that one? That’s a beauty. Yeah. He did a great job as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. That worked out. How’s Newark doing? This election is a choice between Trump recovery at a level that nobody’s ever seen before and a Biden depression. If they get elected, they’re going to double and triple and quadruple your taxes. You will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before and that probably includes 1929, okay.

And one thing we learned about the farmers, they don’t do well in depressions. Do we agree? They don’t do well. Nobody does well under depression. You will have problems like you’ve never had before. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolonged the pandemic. And by the way for those states, open up your states. Open them up. Watch on November 4th. November 4th, all these Democrat governors that have locked downs, right. I always said, I said right at the beginning, I think it was me that came out first. They’ll try and say, “20 years ago somebody said the same thing,” but I said, “The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.” And if you look at what’s happening with these lockdown to children, get the children back to school.

I’ll give you an example. The children, 99.9%. Barron Trump, you know he had the Corona 19, the China virus. It’s got 21 different names. I could go over it, but to me Corona means Italy. China is China, and it came from China so he had the China virus, right. And he had it for such a short period of time. I don’t even think he knew he had it because they’re young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off 99.9% and Barron is beautiful and he’s free. Thank my wife, our First Lady who loves Iowa by the way. Our first lady, she put out that Barron has tested positive.

And I said, “Wow.” And we talked about it. I said, “You put it out.” It’s personal stuff, but we really have it. I said, “Yeah, let’s put it out.” Barron’s tested positive. Within like two seconds, it was Barron is just fine now. He’s tested negative, right. Because it happens. People have it and it goes. Get the kids back to school. We got to get the kids back to school. Get them back to school. All right. Get them back. Get them back. And when I had it, you might’ve read, maybe most of you don’t know this, but I had it too. I didn’t love it, but it’s a little tough and you have a temperature and you don’t feel good. And then the scarier part is where’s it going?

It’s fine. You’re at a 101 or a 102 and then you say that, “I don’t love this.” You haven’t had a temperature in years and then all of a sudden you have it, but you see what happens to people. And I went to the hospital and it’s an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. I’ve seen what they’ve done because I’ve been there many times for our great warriors that come back so badly wounded. And these doctors are incredible. And one thing when you’re president, I’m laying in this bed, not feeling my best. And I’m surrounded by 12 doctors, one’s the head of Johns Hopkins, one’s the head of Walter Reed, one’s the head… These incredible doctors. And I looked at the alternatives, all things we developed in the last seven months, and one of them is Regeneron. And I said, “I’ll take that one because it is very early into testing, but it had great numbers.” And I’m telling you, they gave me this and they call it a therapeutic.

To me, it’s a cure because I felt like Superman the following morning. I felt like… In fact, I made a speech about a day later, two days later. Somebody said he looks better now than he did two weeks ago. What the hell is going on? So this is what’s happening. We’re making tremendous progress. The vaccines are coming out very soon. A lot of great things are happening on that front, but a lot of great things are happening for our country. I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received to… I want to give it to all of the people that qualify for it, people in hospitals, people just before they go to hospitals. It will clean out our hospitals. Eli Lilly makes a very similar drug and we’re going to do it free. We’re going to do it free. It’s not their fault. We’re going to do it free. So we’re in that process of getting an emergency, it’s called emergency use authorization.

And we’re going to Regeneron and the Eli Lilly, a comparable drug, we’re going to give it to everybody. And I hope they have the kind of luck that I have, but maybe I would have been perfect anyway. I like to say, “I didn’t need it. I would have been perfect anyway because I’m so strong.” I said sarcastically, I said, “Well, I’m in no danger because I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m very young.” And CNN goes and reports President Trump lied to the American public. They said, “Can you believe this?” I was telling last night we had an incredible rally in Pennsylvania. Oh, they’re doing at CNN. I thought they were doing it to me, I said, “We don’t have too many of them anymore.”

Do you ever notice? At the beginning when we started, we would always have the phony people that stand up and raise their voice, then go home to mom and get balled up. I don’t know. I shouldn’t be talking about this because all of a sudden we’ll have one, but we don’t have that anymore. I learned about the cameras because the cameras never like showing it. Look where that crowd goes to. Look where that crowd goes to, all the way back to the buildings. And I’m always telling I never thought the cameras could move. And then I just noticed whenever we had a troublemaker in the audience, they’d spin around. They’d be in a pretzel, right? They can do anything these guys. I thought they were rigid, like a rigid piece of steel. They don’t turn, but if we had in the back room behind the pillar somebody, that camera would be turned around like a snake 15 different angles. But that sounds good. That’s a brand new F35 fighter jet. You can’t see it.

They say it’s the greatest plane in the world. And by the way, speaking of that, our military, when I came in the world’s most overrated general told me, “Sir, we have no ammunition because we may have had a conflict very early in.” And I said, “No president should ever hear that.”, And we have rebuilt our military $ 2.5 trillion all made in the USA with equipment like that, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia and China and any other country. We have equipment that nobody has. Our missiles, our rockets, our nuclear has been totally upgraded and pray to God we never have to use it because I see what happens. Pray to God, but if we didn’t have that, we could be in very big trouble. It’s a very tough situation. But you look at the new tanks that we’ve ordered from Ohio, by the way. We kept the Lima, the Lima Plant. I said, “Keep it open.” They were going to close it. I said, “Keep it open.”

Before I became president, I said, “Keep it open,” because I visited. I said, “You could never build a plant like this. You could never get the people to make the tanks and we’re going to be ordering tanks.” we’ve totally rebuilt our military. We have the greatest missiles, rockets, tags, fighters, bombers, tankers, ships in the world, all made in the USA.
You can be proud of your country. Look at this young handsome, this young, handsome farmer. You’re going to be a farmer someday? You’re going to be a farmer? Huh? He goes, “Hell yeah.” I’d like to be a farmer too sometimes I’ll tell you. We’re joined tonight by some incredible friends and great people. Your governor, who’s done an incredible job, Kim Reynolds and Kevin, her husband. Where is Kevin? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Really great job, Kim. How are we doing by the way, okay? We’re looking good. That’s good. Thank you for everything Kim. As well as Lieutenant Governor Adam Greg. Adam, thank you. Thank you very much Adam. Great job.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Naig. Mike, where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Iowas Senate Majority Leader, Jack Whitver. Thank you. See the way they all stay together. They like each other. Speaker of the Iowa House, oh, you got to tell me this. This is good genes I think, right. There are genes involved here, right. Pat Grassley, right. Good genes. What’s the relationship Pat? Huh? That’s good stuff. You got good stock. I want to bet on that guy in the future. Thank you very much. Great job. I hear you’re doing a great job. We’re doing all right? Good. Thank you Pat. Ambassador Terry Branstad. Okay, do we have time for one quick story about Branstad? Because his son, Eric is even better than him, but I’m not going to talk about it.

And here’s the guy that doesn’t mind me saying.a lot of fathers, they get angry if you say that. Oh, I’m better than my son. Those are not great fathers. This guy’s proud. His son is great. But when I met Terry, it was long before I thought about this and I heard the Governor of Iowa was in New York and he wanted to see me. I said, “Oh, what the hell do I want to see the Governor of Iowa for?” I’m putting up buildings and I’m saying, “All right.” And I invited him before I ever thought about really doing this, early on at least. And he came up and a humble guy, great guy, handsome guy. That face, right. And he sat down and I figured I’d give him five minutes. Kim, no longer than that five. And I ended up spending an hour and a half. I said, “That is the smartest governor.” And then I learned, and as you know, he was the governor for 24 years. That’s an all time record in the United States, right. 24 years.

And he told me a story in the first meeting. That was before I think that I was even thinking about doing this. And again, it’s only because Obama and Biden were so bad. I said, “Let me do it.” I wish I didn’t have to, but I’m having a lot of fun because we’re making such progress. But he told me a story. He said, “Many years ago I met a man in China because he was selling corn.” Can you believe it, right, corn crops. And he was selling corn. And he said to his wife, this is 35, 40 years ago. He said, “I met a man in China and I went home to my wife and I said, ‘I just met the next president of China many years forward, but I just met a future president of China.’ And I said, ‘Who was that?’

It was President Xi, who’s now the President of China.” And I said, “You got to be kidding.” He said, “Nope. I could tell right from the beginning he was different.” And I’m not happy with what’s going on, but he said, “I just met the next president.” And then I remembered that story and then I ran and he was so incredible to me and Iowa and he wanted us to win and his son was very much in charge of what we were doing and it worked out great and we won by a lot. And then we won the whole thing. And I said “We have to pick somebody really smart for China.” And I said, “The Governor of Iowa came to me and told me that story and I told him. I said, ‘How would you like to be ambassador to China?’ And he said, ‘Sir, I’ve been doing this for 24 years. It would be an honor.’ And I have to tell you this, he represented us great with China.”

He represented us great. I never told that story. I never told that story, but about a month ago, he called and he said, “Sir, I want to come home now. I want to make sure you get reelected. I want to come home.” And he’s out there. I know he’s out there working, but we love him. He’s a special guy. We’ve got a couple of real beauties with Grassley and with this guy. I’ll tell you, what a couple of great people. Thank you very much for everything. Great job you did as ambassador. The only question I have is do we call you Mr. Ambassador or Mr. Governor? What do you like?
He said, “Either one’s okay.” That’s him. Anyway, thank you very much. Great job. I want to introduce another one who’s one of the best, maybe the best in the whole country. He’s the chairman of the Iowa GOP, Jeff Kaufmann. You look good Jeff. You lost weight Jeff. You lost weight. I’m proud of you, Jeff. You do a great job. How are we doing?
He said, “Iowa is ours.” Always be careful. He said, “Iowa is yours.” I say, “Never say that.” The last one, Beto, remember when he said that he was running for president. He was doing okay. And he was on the cover of a third grade magazine called Vanity Fair and he made the statement, “I was born to do this.” I said, “That’s the end of his political career.” He was born to do it. That didn’t work out. I hear we’re doing great. Thank you very much, Jeff. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Congressional candidate, a star, a guy who’s going to be fantastic, David Young. David, thank you. You got a lot of good candidates. We’re also joined by a very special guest, one of the greatest wrestlers in American history. You know that, right?

He’s an unbelievable guy. I’ve known about him for a long time. Do we all love Jim Jordan, our Congressman, right? Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan is a great wrestler, a great NCAA champion. I know a lot of people don’t know that, but Jim, and Jim’s from Ohio, but he says the greatest of them all is a guy named Dan Gable. You ever hear of Dan Gable? And listen to this. I mean, I have to tell you, is Dan here? I hope he’s here. Come here Dave. Come on. Come on. Look at this. You mean I can’t take this guy in a fight? Can you believe it? Wow. Wow. Hey Dan, I’m immune and I can’t give it to you so that’s good. We love you so. But I met Dan a few years ago and I looked at him and I said, “How come he’s 181-1. Think of it. He won 181. People don’t know that’s crazy. 181-1. I’m going to ask you later on who is the one? I want to find out who, but he did something else. He won the Olympics 1972. And to do that, he had to wrestle against the six greatest wrestlers in that weight class in the world. And he did something never done before. He didn’t yield one point throughout the whole thing and he ended up beating in the Olympic finals for the gold medal, he beat the great Russian wrestler. Didn’t get a point. He went through the whole thing. Nobody got a point and I’m looking at him and I’m saying to myself, “I’m telling you, I could take him, but I better not try.”

But Dan has been inducted into the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the US Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he’s become University of Iowa’s all time most winning coach. In fact, Jim Jordan said, He was as great a coach as he was a wrestler.” He won many. How many championships did you win as a coach Dan?
15. And I come from a town where you have the Jets, they never win. You have the Mets, they never win. We won 15. That’s called talent. It’s called extraordinary talent actually. And what I did is I thought about it. I thought about it long and hard. We’re very selective. So the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the two greatest awards you can get in our country. And I’m proud to announce that I will be awarding very shortly at the White House in the Oval Office, Coach Gable the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Say something Joe. Great honor.
Well, he’s the pride of Iowa and he’s great. You always try and figure out what makes a champion because you look at him. Nice guy, good looking guy, all that stuff, but why is he 181-1? Why is he a gold medalist that’s done something that nobody ever did? Didn’t allow one point of any of these wrestlers and they’re all the best of the world, the toughest, and it’s just something different and you’ll probably never figure it out. It is with great champions. You see it and you see it all the time with great champions, but there are very few. Jack Nicklaus you see it. Tiger got the same award. When Tiger won the Masters a few months ago, I said, “You know what, that’s an incredible thing he did.” And we gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he said it’s one of the greatest honors. He actually said it’s his greatest honor. I said, “Tiger, you deserve it.”

He went through a lot and he came back and… But you have great champions and they’re different and nobody knows why. That man is different and he’s a champion and it’s an honor to present you to the people that love you most, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. We’ve got a V-shape, we’re going to see some very big numbers and you’re seeing it. In my first three years, family income increased by $6,000. That’s more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. African-American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. So proud of that. African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached the lowest levels in history. At the end of the last administration, the Congressional Budget Office projected fewer than 2 million jobs would be created over the next three years and we crushed that prediction and created almost 8 million jobs. Nobody can believe it and we’re doing it…

Nobody can believe it. We’re doing it again. My policies have benefited those who needed it the most. The bottom 50% of households saw an astonishing 40% increase in net worth after our tax cuts, wages grew fastest for the nicest, I mean it makes me feel so good, blue collar workers. They were the ones that had the biggest benefit from what we did. Since the China virus, we have created a record 11.4 million jobs. That’s a record. We’ve never created jobs at a level at which we’re creating them now. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half, we’re down to 7.8%. Sounds high, but a lot of people said we’re going to be a 42%. We’re down to 7.8 and going down rapidly. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost, 30 months. We did it in five months. Jobs have been recovering. Think of this. Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama-Biden recovery. 23 times faster. Not 23%, 23 times faster.

I’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He supported NAFTA, a disaster. Now you have USMCA, it’s the best. It’s now kicked in. He supported TPP. Would have destroyed your farms, would have destroyed everything, and our auto industry would have been gone, and he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a catastrophe for our nation. China tries to get away with the fact that they are a developing nation. Not anymore. If Biden wins, China wins. That’s what’s going to happen. If Biden wins, China will own our country. They’ll own it. And if we win, Iowa wins, and America wins, and we’re going to win for a long time.

For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. As I mentioned, one of the things that was very important to me was to eliminate the very unfair estate tax or death tax on small businesses and farms. Now, if you love your child and you’re a farmer and you think he’s doing a great job or she’s doing a great job, and she wants to keep the farm or he wants to keep the farm, there is no more estate tax where they have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay the tax.

Is there anybody here who has a child to which they do not want to leave the farm because they don’t like their child? Raise your hand, please. Does anybody have the courage? There’s one person over there. He says he’s only kidding. No, but it’s a big thing. I mean, look, it’s a big thing. A lot of farms were put out of business. The parents, they pass away, they leave the farm to the son, the daughter, to the family, and the family has to go out and borrow a fortune and then they have a little bad season, a couple of bad seasons, and they end up losing everything. We don’t have that anymore. We cut the estate tax, it’s out, gone.

These are things a lot of people don’t even know. We’ve got that. Along with the tax cuts, we got that. Biden wants to repeal our tax cuts and massively raised taxes on your family farms. And what we did was hit the, you know this, you know exactly, we hit it so quickly. We hit so hard. We hit so strong on this whole tax situation because the farmers were being treated unfairly. So unfairly with respect to taxes. I quickly issued a major disaster declaration and I will be with you every step of the way. I think Kim will say this, your governor, when you had floods all over the place, you were like a large scale swimming pool. I hate to say it, Iowa. I looked at the pictures that your governor sent. I said, “Kim, I never knew that this was ocean front property.” And we took care of you, right? We gave you everything you needed and we got rid of all of, we’ve rebuilt the dams and the dikes. Right? We rebuilt it and we rebuilt it fast.

My opponent is foot forward, a radical plan to eliminate US borders by implementing catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals of illegal alien. So if you have somebody that’s a murderer or a rapist, we can’t do it. They agreed with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. There’s nobody that knows how to lose like Bernie. Four years ago, he lost, he went home happy. He lost again because Pocahontas refused to get out of the race. Otherwise, I would have been running against Bernie. I don’t know which is better. There would have been a lot more enthusiasm for Bernie, smaller base, more enthusiasm, Bernie got, I’ll tell you.

We’re going to get a lot of the Bernie voters because they don’t like Joe. And they love our policy on dealing with other nations because they love our policy on trade because they understand. They happen to understand that, but they also know we can do something about it. Bernie would have never been able to do that. The United States would be completely overrun in a matter of days. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing the wall. It’s now over 400 miles long. It’s already built. And as I said, Mexico is paying for the wall.

We did more, one of these fake reporters said it, we did more, one of the only politicians that’s ever run, forget about politician, but one of the only politicians ever run that actually has done more than he or she has promised. As an example, I campaigned a lot in Iowa. I never mentioned the word space force, but when I got into office, I realized I looked at Russia, I looked at Kim Jong-un, I looked at China. I said, “We need a space force,” and we got space force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail.

We also passed VA choice for our great veterans and VA accountability, things that they said were impossible to get done. So now, instead of waiting online for weeks and weeks, if they have to wait, they go out to a doctor, we pay the bill and it’s been a great thing. 91% approval rating in the VA. They’re doing a great job over there. Think of it, I shouldn’t be telling you this because they’ll find a vet someplace who’s unhappy. But think of it, all our lives we used to see on the evening news horror shows with the vets and the vets and the vets, and it’s terrible what they’re doing. You don’t see any stories about the VA. You don’t see any stories. We have done 91% approval rating by the vets for the VA, the job we’re doing.

And we defeated 100%. We’re bringing our soldiers home, but we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq. And when I took over, it was a mess. And we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for years and years. And we then took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many other troops and many other people, Qasem Soleimani is dead. Dead.

One of the biggest things to happen in the Middle East in 50 years. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear catastrophe. $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. That deal’s practically expiring now anyway, if we didn’t terminate it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And you know that presidents have been talking about that for decades. Every president said they were going to do that, then they never had the guts to do it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and that’s been 52 years they’ve been talking about that. I got it done in about two hours.

And instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East. So I get nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes, different subjects. And I told the story the other night, I was in Florida or Pennsylvania, I told our First Lady, “Darling, we’re going to have the greatest publicity I’ve ever had tonight. I got nominated for the Nobel Prize. Do you know what that is, darling.” Let’s go home. So I leave for the first time in a long time, early. I get home, I turn on the television. They talked about your floods in Iowa. They talked about how’s Iowa doing with the crops. How’s this happening? How are they doing in Florida? Three, four stores, one after another, where’s my Nobel Peace Prize, they don’t talk about it.

I said, “Darling, this news is a little tough. It’s a little tough to crack.” When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was so early he didn’t even do anything. He still doesn’t know what he got at for. They said, “Why did you get it?” He said, “I have no idea.” And it was the biggest story, it was all over the place. With me, I got three and they got three dominations, nobody talks about it. So at least I figured I might as well mentioned it, right? Kim, I should mention it, right? Kevin. Right, Kevin? Kevin, stand up please, Kevin. There’s the guy.

I went on a hunting trip. My son, Don, he loves hunting. And he went Kevin, Don and about 300 of the governors, your previous Terri, your previous governor’s friends. And they all went hunting and it was like 25 degrees below zero. The only two guys that stood out there the whole time were Kevin and Don Trump Jr. And they came back. Everyone else was back at about 15 minutes, Terry, right? There were all back and they wanted to go back into the lodge, the hell with this. And after a weekend, my son comes back and Kevin comes back and you two guys didn’t even know what they were talking about. You didn’t know what the problem was. Right? People don’t know that about Don and they don’t know that, but Kevin is fantastic. Thank you Kevin, for being here. Appreciate it. He’s a real guy.

So I’m ending the old wars and Biden will lead us into new wars. And we did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years, and that’s a fact. And if you look at the Democrats, they’re pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. Their plan would destroy your social security, destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. I got the travel ban. Everyone said, “Oh, that’s not nice.” I said, “Really?” It’s not nice to come up and blow up cities either is it? We won on the United States Supreme Court and he wants to end it. And surge refugee admissions by 700%, meaning 700% opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. No thank you. No thank you, sleepy Joe. He’ll ban school choice and he’ll ban charter schools, very important places.

Civil rights all starts with the education and we need school choice. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We’ve already started. We’ve already started. It’s an incredible thing because it’s great education for less money. It’s sort of a crazy thing. Less money, great education. And just to finish up, a vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happened.

We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might. We have never, ever been even close to as strong as we are right now, greatest equipment ever in our history. And we will ensure peace through strength.

If you remember, when I ran, they said, “Oh, he’s a very militant kind of a guy. We’ll be in a war the first week.” Well, where’s the war? Where’s the war? And I’m making other countries pay because NATO, they weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent to use the New York real estate term. They weren’t paying their bills. I said, “You got to pay.” The secretary general of NATO is my single biggest fan. They’re paying $130 billion a year more now because I said, “Look, you got to pay. You got to pay.” They rip us on trade and there was supposed to protect them, the European Union. So NATO, so they’re paying 130 billion more going to $410 billion more each year. So that’s it. Where are the wars? He’s going to get us into a war. Where are the wars? They don’t want any part of us. Nobody wants any part of us in the world. They were tired of being ripped off as a country.

We will end surprise medical billing. The surprise medical billing is a disaster. It’s ending as of January 1st. Require price transparency, all signed, all done, January 1st. Can you imagine if I lose and I’ve done all these things? They kick in on January 1st. You’re going to say “Boy, that Biden’s done a great job on price transparency.” And they’ll say, “What are you thinking? He has no idea what the hell it is.” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. We went through a favorite nations clause so that we will pay the lowest drug prices in the world. Okay?

We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And when I took over, NASA was basically closed. It was shredded, it was nothing. And now it’s the number one preeminent space center, anywhere in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education through our schools.

We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust, and it won’t change. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Iowa.

Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your workers and coworkers and get the hell out to vote because if I don’t get Iowa, I won’t believe that one. I may never have to come back here again if I don’t get Iowa. I’ll never be back. You understand that Kim? I will say this. There has never been a president has done more for farmers and ranchers. For the farm belt, for Iowa, there’s never been a president that’s even come close to what I’ve done. And I will say that and I’ll say it louder and clearer. I’ll say that loud and clear. From Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, we stand on the shoulders of Iowa patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes.

Just nobody has anything more than what you have so much. Look at yourselves and look where you’ve come. Look even in the world of politics, Iowa, it’s Iowa. And by the way, as long as I’m here, Iowa, and I made this pledge to you four years ago, Iowa will always come first in the rotation. You know what that means, right? There’s a lot of pressure. Let’s put them back. I said, “No, you’re not putting them back.” You know why? Because that’s called the opposite of cancel culture. That’s called a great American tradition. Iowa will always be number one. Okay? You can forget it. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. So much you’ve done. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come.

Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we are one movement, we are one people in one family. We are one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you Iowa. Thank you. Thank you very much.",14/10/2020

Thank you very much. Thank you. Let’s see, it’s 1:30. This is a hell of a crowd for 1:30 in the afternoon. Thank you.
 
Great state. It’s fantastic to be back in North Carolina with thousands of loyal, hard working Americans patriots. 19 days from now, think of that, 19 days, do you believe this? We’re going to win the State of North Carolina, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins. Do you see what’s going on? When we win, North Carolina wins and America wins. It’s very simple.

For the last 47 years. Joe Biden’s betrayed the workers of North Carolina through one act of economic treachery after another and now you see what’s happening. They got caught stealing folks. Biden’s a servant of the wealthy donors and globalist and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry, taking your jobs from North Carolina and every other place and moving them out of the country. We turned it around. You got to remember that.

These corrupt forces, they don’t see our nation as a protector of its citizens, but as a vehicle for personal profit and power at your expense, and you see it happening right now. They hold everyone in contempt and they always put the American worker last and that’s what’s happened until I came along. In fact, it’s the primary reason I came along if you think about it.

They keep their jobs while outsourcing your jobs to other countries, countries that you’ve never even heard about. They build walls for themselves while forcing your family to suffer the consequences of illegal immigration, drugs, and crime. You know it very well over here.

For five decades, Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars, and you know, they’re all coming back, they’re almost back, our great soldiers. Our great soldiers. Countries you’d never even heard about. He’s the embodiment of the political class that enriched itself while draining economic life and soul out of our country.

Yesterday, we learned from newly released emails, and I want to thank the New York Post for showing real bravery, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he has been corrupt for many years and everybody in Washington knew it.

And just now, a little while ago, a new story shows up that Hunter made a deal with a wealthy Chinese business magnet for $10 million a year for introductions only. Introductions. I don’t know, “Will you take 10 million a year to introduce people?” “Yeah to introduce dad. Dad say hello, and by the way, dad give them everything they want. Okay? Give them everything they want dad.”

Hunter also referred to another more lasting and lucrative arrangement with the same Chinese businessman that, “Would be so much more interesting to me and my family,” that’s what he said. That’s a quote. These deals were made at the same time Joe Biden was letting China steal your jobs and take away your factories.

If Biden is elected, the United States will be owned by China, but we don’t have to worry about it because I can’t believe it’s going to happen. He’s shot, just so we understand. We cannot have a leader that’s just about half-shot. Can we believe we’re even fighting against this guy? But you know what? They’re a powerful party. They’re very corrupt party. They’re in bed with the media, the fake news, right back there.

And totally protected by big tech. If I said what he said, they’d be calling for me out of there in 24 hours, what this guy has said. Two days ago, he said, “I’m running for the United States Senate.” That’s the third time he said it, “I’m running for the …” Now, that’s not like a regular mistake. You can make a mistakes. He said that, and then he said other things, but we won’t even get into it. This is crazy. This is the craziest race.

You know what? I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics, and if I lose, it puts more pressure. I wish he was good. I wish he was good, I’d have less pressure. You know what I mean? How do you lose to a guy like this? Like how do you lose to a guy like this? And by the way, we’re leading in North Carolina, a poll just came in. I think we’re leading everywhere where people are intelligent actually. And you actually … We just got a report, the lines are through the roof on areas that would more typically vote for us. I’m trying to be diplomatic when I say that. Thank you. But this election is a matter of national security. It really is. We can’t let this happen. It’s a matter of national security. The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. Now, big tech, you see what’s going on with big tech? Is censoring these stories to try and get Biden out of this impossible jam. He’s in a big jam. You know, his son left his laptop at some place, “Fix my laptop.” He forgot to pick it up. The guy from the laptop, it looks like he saw it. He said, “Wow, this is really criminal stuff.” He brought it to the FBI. Can you believe this?

This could only happen to me and the people of North Carolina, no this could only happen to us. Can you imagine, he’s fixing a laptop? He says, “This is really bad stuff. I think I’ll bring it into law enforcement.” Anyway, they’ve got it. They’ve got a lot of them. I hear they have stuff coming out you won’t even believe, yeah you’ll believe it. He and his family are crooked and they were caught. They got caught. Now they’re being protected by big tech and if big tech persists in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protection. Okay, it’s very simple.

We all believe in freedom of the press, but don’t big tech got something years ago that let them become big tech, they got total protection. They don’t get sued. They don’t get anything, they’re totally protected. So the government gave that, so that takes away that little feeling that, “Oh gee, we can’t talk to them about freedom of the press, et cetera.” No, we’re going to take away their Section 230, unless they shape up.

Believe it or not, even the Democrats agree. Of course, the only problem we have when they say that we’re against, it’s like the wall, you know, we’re building the wall? It’s going up. It was so hard. It was so hard getting that done. There was very few people who could have gotten that done. We’re up over 400 miles, but here’s what’s happened. I just think back. All I had to say is, “We will not build a wall,” they would’ve given me so much money. I had to say we were building it, but we got to going and we have the safest Southern border we’ve ever had so that’s all good.

In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president of the United States who put America first. And we’ve done a job. We’ve done a great job. It’s been amazing. Our comeback, nobody’s ever done anything like what we did, and then we got hit by the China plague. Shouldn’t have let it happen. We’re now coming back at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. Nobody thought it was possible. They thought we’d be at 42% unemployment. We just had 7.8%. Can you believe it?

Now, we were in 3.5%? I even went to North Carolina. I needed a good chief of staff. I said, “Where is he? Where’s Mark Meadows?” Where’s Mark? Where’s Mark? Come here Mark. Come here. Can you imagine? I had to go to North Carolina to find my chief of staff. No, he’s great. No, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job. He followed me and I said, “You know what? I just tested positive.” He didn’t care. He was in that helicopter. Hey, he’s from North Carolina, what can I say? Yeah, he’s great. Doing a great job.

You elected me to restore the principle that’s a nation’s first duty, and it’s to its own citizens. We’re about our country, right? I’m president of our country. We’re not president of the world. We’re not president of the world. The USA. So if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always seem to be playing by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than any other president has ever fought for our country’s people.

Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus and we’re doing really a good job. We’re rounding the turn. You see what’s going on in Europe? It’s flaming up. These characters back there, they say, “Well look at Europe.” Well, I’ll tell you what, go take a look, go take a look. No, we’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job. They didn’t give the credit. I don’t want the credit. But our vice president worked 24 hours a day, Mike Pence. And we had a lot of governors. They worked with us, but we had some that were really good, and some that were really not so good. I’ll let you know one day, I’ll write a little book and I’ll tell you who the good ones were.

We made a lot of people look good. We’ve done a great job. We have some incredible statistics, but we want to rebuild the economy and that’s happening quickly. We had the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Think of it. Now, we closed it down and we saved 2 million lives by closing it down. We closed it down and now we’re building it back up, and by the way, North Carolina, tell you governor, “Open up your state, open up your schools.” Right? Right?

They’ll announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re opening up by North Carolina, and by the way, Pennsylvania.” You know, we’ve been suing a lot of states that are run by Democrats, right? I always call them high crime. But the fact is that’s where the crime is. But we’ve been suing a lot of people and we just won in Michigan against … what she did was terrible. I mean, she did … It’s like a prison warden. So Michigan, we won on a constitutional basis to have to open it up. You got to open this one up. I mean the people want to get back. The kids want to be back in school, 99.9%.

Like you heard yesterday, they announced, my Baron, my tall Baron, he’s very tall. My beautiful Baron, and handsome, he is handsome, but my beautiful Baron had it, he recovered like so fast. I said, “Wait a minute. How long did that take?” They have the strongest immune systems, they’re better than all of us. That’s what they are, they’re kids, for some reason. But we’ve learned about this disease. You got to open up your businesses, open up your schools, get it going.

We have incredible therapeutics, have incredible drugs. We have, in my opinion, a cure because I took something, Regeneron. It was highly sophisticated stuff, the antibodies, and Eli Lilly makes an incredible drug. What we’ve done is incredible. This is all been over the last six months. It’s all happened. We got the FDA for fast approvals. They would have taken years and years and they’re doing it … They came to me on one, “Sir, this will take approximately two years.” I said, “Nope, I needed to prove tomorrow.” They said, “That’s not good.” We got it too. We got it.

But this is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain, in exchange for his party’s nomination, he has handed control of the socialists … I mean he’s given control of this party, the Democrats, they used to be like normal people. Now they’re socialists, Marxists, communists. That’s right. You said it, I didn’t say it, communists. Some people would say far left lunatics. Look at the Green New Deal.

Well, don’t clap too hard. Go out and vote. We’ll clap later because these people are crazy. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country because they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they win, we won’t have our country anymore, and it’ll never be able to come back. They never do.

If you look at 20 years ago, Venezuela had oil, it had wealth, less than 20 years ago, it had everything. Now they don’t have water. They don’t have food. They don’t have medicine. They have nothing but killing all over their streets. This happened in a short period of time and it’s the same ideology. You see it. The Democrat party talks about decency and decorum while they demonize and cancel, you know the word cancel, right? They want to cancel your culture and persecute anyone who refuses to bend to their will. I don’t think they like me too much, do they? They don’t like me too much. That’s really an honor. That’s an honor. You know why? Because those words, nobody has ever heard them at a political event. I liked Ronald Reagan and they’d say, “We like you Ronald Reagan,” but nobody’s ever heard those words, right? “We love you.” No, seriously? What politician has ever heard those words? I’ve never said those words and that happens and I consider that a great honor and thank you very much. Thank you.

But the Democrats smear decent Americans as racist, slander our nation as evil. Indoctrinate our children and incite anti-American riots on our streets that we could control in 25 minutes, as we did in Minneapolis, as we do wherever we go, but they have to invite us in. By law, they have to invite us in. We want to go to Portland so bad. That one would take 15 minutes to set. 15 minutes.

The man that shot another innocent man, this was an innocent man shot, killed, instantly killed. I said, “What happened?” “Well, we haven’t arrested him.” Two days. Three days went by. We sent in the US Marshals, it took 15 minutes, it was over. 15 minutes it was over. We got him. They knew who he was. They didn’t want to arrest him and 15 minutes that ended.

Anyway, and they call themselves peaceful protesters. In theory, we’re not supposed to be … and look at all the masks. They keep saying, “Nobody wears masks, wear the masks.” Although then they come out with things today. Did you see, the CDC? That 85% of the people wearing the mask catch it, okay?

Then you have my friend, and he’s a nice guy, Tony, Tony Fauci. He’s a nice guy. He said, “This is not a threat. This is not a problem. Don’t worry about it, [ 00:19:04] a problem.” It’s the craziest thing. Then he said, “Do not wear a mask. Do not wear a mask under any circumstances. Don’t wear a mask. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” Right? So we don’t wear a mask. Then they say, “Oh, wear a mask.” I never saw … Do you ever see any conflicts? But he’s a nice guy. So I keep him around. Right? We’ll keep him around.

He’s a Democrat, everybody knows that. He’s Cuomo’s friend. Cuomo did the worst job of any governor in the United States. Almost 40,000 people died, more, and 11,000 at least, and you know, I gave him this big convention center, 2,800 beds. He didn’t use it. I gave him a ship. I gave him the great hospital ship meant for wars, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of incredible … You have to see the ship. I’ve been on it many times, it’s incredible. They didn’t use it. Instead, they sent sick people back into nursing homes, right? It’s a disgrace. The Democrat party is ashamed of America. The Republican party is proud of America and that’s a big difference. A big difference. Thank you.

So you know, I’m being set up tonight, right? So I’m doing this town hall with a Concast, C-O-N, right? Con, because it’s a con-job, Concast, C-O-N, not C-O-M. C-O-N-cast. So I’m doing it, and it’s NBC, the worst. It’s the home of sleepy eyes, Chuck Todd, and some others. They gave Lester Holt, he’s a beauty. They gave Joe Biden, a week ago, a town hall, and it was meant for children. In fact, speaking of Baron Trump, he fully recovered in like record time, Baron Trump would do great …

Trump fully recovered in record time. Barron Trump would do great on that show, because he’s a young child. They ask him questions that a child could answer, any child, a smart child, not such a smart child. And they got taken apart. It was a joke. It was a joke. And so they asked me if I’d do it, and I figured, what the hell? We get a free hour on television, and we have Savannah Guthrie. She’s always lovely, isn’t she? But I figure, why not? Watch the difference in tone between what they did to this guy, that kid put two sentences together, and what they do to me. But with me, it’s me. It’s a life. We know what we’re doing and we just go on and we do it, but they’re doing him on doing him on ABC. And actually I’d like to watch him because I want to see if he can make it through the program.

And, honestly, they’ll be so soft. George Stephanopoulos, I did him a couple of weeks ago. It was fine. His questions were unfair. They said that the audience is neutral. Turned out that they only had Never-Trumpers in there. But these are minor, little minor facts. Well, that happened with the other guy too. It was supposed to be neutral. It turned out that they were all big Democrats, right? Big Democrats. Because you know what? The fake news media is corrupt. It’s corrupt, and we’ve shown it so many times. So I’ll see you later on NBC, I look forward to it. We’re going to be doing it from Miami, where we’re doing very well in Florida too, by the way. We just got numbers back. Doing very well. And the senior citizens are liking us, I think, more and more every day. Every day, they see what we’re doing. Every single day. But we’re going to be doing that from Florida, so you’ll watch tonight. If you want to have a little entertainment, watch.

Let’s just see. I just want to see the tone of the way they treated this character and the way they treat us. It’s not me, it’s us, the way they treat us. So the candidate whose supporters are burning American flags, and I say all the time, let’s put in some kind of a major, major resolution, you burn an American flag, you spent one year in jail. Do it.
See, that’s where the politicians are weak. The politicians could do this. That’s where they’re weak, the politicians. And I think it lost five to four in the Supreme Court. Now we have a different Supreme Court. Hey, by the way, can you imagine, we’re going to have number three in one term, which is a record, a record. President’s go an entire, Presidency, one term, two terms, without ever having to pick a Supreme Court. I have three in the first term. Their heads are exploding. These people can’t believe it. You know what? Our friends over here, they can’t believe what’s happening, I’ll tell you. But we have three. And how good is Amy? How good is Amy?
They said, “He should not be able to do this.” I said, “Why? I’m in my fourth year.” “He should not be allowed to do it.” But then they have a quote from Justice Ginsburg talking about, I guess it was Obama, right, that, “Well, wait a minute. He’s elected for four years. He’s not elected for three years.” That didn’t help them. That didn’t help their cause. No, we got it done. It looks like it’s going to be done very soon. They have a one week period where they sit, but they’re getting out of committee and it’s very exciting. And I’ll tell you what, she’s been flawless. She hasn’t made a mistake. She’s toying with those Democrat evil people. They’re evil. The way they treated Justice Kavanaugh was one of the greatest disgraces. I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve watched a lot of unfair things. I get treated that way all the time.

But I want to tell you, I’ve never seen anything like it, the way they went after Justice Kavanaugh with false accusations and everything else. It’s a disgrace, but they’re not playing that card here. They’re not playing that card, at least so far they’re not, but we’ll be watching very closely. But she’s been spectacular. She’s getting rave reviews. She’s a great intellect. Her professor, who was a great professor many years, said the single greatest student that he’s ever had. That meant something to him. It’s always nice. As long as you’re doing it, you might as well put smart people. Now, they’ll say, “He discriminates. He discriminates against others.” No, I like to have smart people on the Supreme Court, and she’s been great.

But the candidate whose supporters are tearing down our statues is not going to deliver any civility. And by the way, we solve every problem. And these are Democrat, radical left usually, but Democrat areas that are having these high crime. The Republicans are doing fantastically well, remember it. No cash bail. They do things that nobody could even conceive of and they’re out of control. But you know what’s going to bring it all together? Success, because we were bringing it all together before the plague came in from China. Should have never happened. They shouldn’t have let it happen. They let it happen. We’re not forgetting. They’ll pay for it. But before the plague came in from China … Well, Biden’s not going to make them pay. He’s going to get cash. They paid his son a lot of money. What’s he going to do? Say, “Hey, you shouldn’t do this.”

And that’s true. That’s common sense. Look at the money they’ve out of China. I’ll tell you what, he really is, he’s a corrupt politician, just remember it. And I’m going to say it more and more, and Facebook and all can try and shut us down. But you know what? Everybody knows it. You don’t have a kid who gets thrown out of the military, hasn’t got a job for a long time, his father becomes the Vice President, and now this kid’s going into every country, walking away with millions of dollars from every country with no talent, no skill, no expertise. And the press doesn’t want to cover it because they’re corrupt. Is that true? I mean, how true is that? And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician’s salary for his whole life. 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place.

I haven’t seen him, but he’s a politician and you’re not supposed to live like you’ve made $20 million a year. So he’s corrupt as hell and everyone knows it. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your job, and that’s what they’ve done. They’ve killed your jobs, dismantle your police departments, and that’s what they’re doing. Dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes by four times. And how about this? How about the fracking? There will be no fracking. That’s when everybody was against, because the super radical left primaries, right? There will be no fracking. Here’s Biden. “No, I said there will be. How many times do I have to say it? There will be no fracking.” Now he gets the nomination. The following day, he said, “No, that will be fracking.” And I said, “Okay, he’s going to get killed by the media on this.” They never even asked him the question.

I hope you’re watching Pennsylvania because you will lose one million fracking jobs almost immediately, because you know what? Joe has no control over that party. That’s all AOC and Crazy Bernie and all these maniacs. But we were coming together really well. I was getting calls from people that normally I wouldn’t want and they wouldn’t want me, and they’re saying, “It’s amazing.” We had the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had. We had 160 million people working. Think about it, 160 million. We were never even close. We were beating China at a level that they’ve never been beaten before. I was charging them tariffs. They didn’t know what the hell to do. And they were always going to overtake us in 2019. If you go back 15, 20 years, 10 years, China was always going to overtake us, 2019. Well, in 2019, we became much, much bigger and we were way overtaking them and they weren’t even close to overtaking us. It was just the opposite.

We were coming together as a country because everything was good. Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, people with diplomas, people without diplomas, people with no high school education, PhDs from MIT, everybody was coming together. And then we had the plague. But that’s going to bring us together again because you had your best year in the history of your state. You had the best year last year in the history of your state. You’re going to have a better year coming up. This is going to be a better year. And watch your third quarter, watch your third quarter. But the radical Democrats will confiscate your guns, destroy your suburbs. I keep hearing about the suburban women. The American dream, it is. I let you have the American dream. I wiped out a regulation that will destroy the suburbs. Do you know that? You know about that. I wiped it out, right? They don’t want to have a project built next to their beautiful house, right?

So why is it that the fake news keeps saying that women aren’t going to like Trump? You know what women want more than anything else? They want safety, security, and they want to be able to have their houses and leave me alone. The suburban woman. And then early on, before I realized it wasn’t politically correct, sorry, folks, haven’t been doing this too long, I said, “The suburban housewife loves Trump.” And by the way, the women, they loved it. Does anybody mind that term? Is that a bad term? The only people that mind it are those people there with the cameras. Look at them. Look how innocent they look, and they’re not innocent. They’re not innocent. The enemy of the people. I call them the enemy of the people. But, anyway, so the suburban women should love Trump. Now, this is the same thing, this is like a carbon copy of what happened last time, not nearly as bad.

Remember, you had nine states. I was going to lose all of them the day before. And they were just wrong a little bit. I won all of them. I was going to lose all nine. They said, “This will be a horrible evening for Donald Trump.” That wasn’t President Trump. That was Donald Trump. “This evening will be over very shortly.” Then we went and Florida. We win North Carolina, by the way. We win South Carolina. We win Georgia. We ran the coast. We just ran it one after another. And remember it said, they had this little crazy chart on NBC, and that’s when the people started crying that worked there. “Oh my God, what am I going to tell my wife after two and a half years of saying, he’s not going to make it.” And remember it said 3%. I had a 3% chance, right? So it’s at 3%. Then we won Utah. Remember, we were supposed to lose Utah. We only won by 22 points. Very accurate. So we win you Utah.

So it goes 3%, 5%, 8%, 12%, 21%. Now they’re saying, “Man, that sucker. That number is getting bad up there, that little number.” Then it started getting smaller, because they made the numbers small, but the number was actually getting bigger. 21%, 25%. Then we won a place called North Carolina. So it went from 25% to 32% right through that evening. Wasn’t that a great evening? Started off with Ohio. Remember, “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” I heard that for a year. And then we won Ohio by 8.7. So everyone said, “Nobody wins it by eight.” By the way, we’re doing better there now that we did four years ago. The great Jim Jordan and all those guys. So we won by eight points and that was the beginning. They said, “Wait a minute. Not only did he win, he won by a lot.” But that was the little signal as to what was happening.

So then it goes to 25, then 31, 35. Now we hit the 42. So now I have a 42 chance of winning. And I’m looking at all these states and I’m leading in most of them, right? We won 32 or 34 States. So it goes 34, 38, and now they’re going, “Oh, what’s going on here?” And remember the guy, John King at CNN. And he’s good with the board. I like it. He’s got nice action. But it wasn’t so good that night. He was shaking And he’s going, “Okay, well, look, this is not looking good. This is not good. I don’t know.” And now he’s a nervous mess. And he’s going, “What’s going to happen?” Who’s there, Heather? Oh, Hemmer, Bill Hemmer. Well, Bill Hemmer’s a good guy, right? Bill Hemmer’s a good guy. Oh, he said, “Hemmer’s better.” I agree with that. Hemmer’s a good guy.

But you know what? It’s very interesting. So then we go from 42 to 48, 54, 60, 64, then 71. This is in our favor. Then 78. Then you see all the people screaming and crying. It was beautiful. The most beautiful convention center. They had that. Remember they had the earth that was shaped like the United States. And they had the podium on the state of Florida out there hanging out over. And I looked, I said, I said to our great First Lady, I said, “First Lady, that is the most beautiful looking thing I’ve ever seen.” The way they had it. They spent a fortune. But they knew something was wrong because they went to Grucci, and they were in the river at the convention center, and they had a big display of 4th of July, whatever the hell it is, the fireworks. And they paid a lot of money. But now they had to pay seven million. They owed $7 million to Grucci and they were all set to do it. And then they decided to cancel.

So I then called up Grucci. I said, “Listen, it’s way far away from my location, but I’ll give you a million dollars.” I tried to buy their fireworks. I figured I’d give New York, have a little fun. But I’ll never forget that beautiful. And it looked so beautiful. Five o’clock, it’s beautiful. They’re all looking like, oh, they’re going to have a big evening. And by eight o’clock in the evening, you watch these people. Remember the woman screaming, you know the one? Screaming. How about her? You think she’s a reasonable person to deal with? And she was screaming, they’re screaming. And they talked about the glass ceiling, right? The woman breaking the glass ceiling. And it didn’t work out that way. The glass ceiling broke her. But there will be a woman that breaks the glass ceiling. It just won’t be Hillary.

And you know what else it won’t be? It won’t be Kamala. Won’t be. It won’t be Kamala. But we worry about her. I’m very concerned about her, because as you probably just heard just before I walked out, two of the people that traveled with her, her chief of staff and somebody else in the plane with her all the time, they have been tested positive for COVID- 19. So we extend our best wishes, right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best, which is more than they did to me. But that’s okay. That’s okay. So let’s see what happens. I mean, it’s a tricky thing. It’s dust. It’s a little tricky thing. Masks, no masks, everything, you can do all you want. But you still need help from the boss. You need help from the boss. That’s what happened. We needed help. Yeah, we needed help. It’s all right to say.

Now, they’ll criticize me for that. “How dare he say that. How dare he say that.” No, I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I’ll say it. Somebody said to me the other day, “You’re the most famous person in the world by far.” I said, “No, I’m not. No, I’m not.” They said, “Yes, you are. I said, “No.” They said, “Who’s more famous?” I said, “Jesus Christ.” I’m not taking any chances. I’m not going to have it. Hey, I’m not having any arguments. Jesus Christ. I’m not going to take any chances, I guarantee. And let me look up and I’ll say and it’s not even close. To defend our Constitution, I proudly nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. It’s been so popular. A lot of people said I got elected because of the United States Supreme Court. I don’t know that it’s true. But when I ran, people knew who I was and all, but they didn’t know too much about my politics. And they figured maybe I’m liberal. Who knows? They didn’t.

And they weren’t happy because they didn’t know who I was going to appoint as a Supreme Court Justice. Was I going to put a radical left person, like he will put? He’s got to give a list, by the way. Not only can he not pack the court, which would be horrible, horrible for our country, for that institution, but he’s got to give a list of 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 that he will only pick from, because people have to be able to see who he is going to pick. You can’t let somebody go up and put a crazy radical left justice in the Supreme Court. So I’m going a step further than them. They don’t press him much. How about if I said what he said? He said, “No, no, I’m not going to say. I’ll tell them after the election.” Oh, that’s great. That’s wonderful. And then these guys walk away. No, no, he’s got to say about packing the court, but he’s also got to say who from what group will he pick?

Give the names because you have to know that. You have to know that. And they say that’s what won me the election. I don’t know if it’s true, but a lot of people say because I came up, and I was having a lot of, when I first went, had a lot of bike back, where people were saying, “Well, wait a minute. Who’s he going to pick as a Supreme Court Judge?” And I said to my people, who are some really great people, I said, “Give me the top 25.” It was 20, and then ultimately expanded to 25 judges, lawyers, group of people. “Give me the top 25 judges, et cetera, in the United States. I want the smartest, the best, the most brilliant, and I’m going to put them in a list.” And I didn’t know, I don’t think, almost any of them, but these are the most respected people. They believe in a thing called the Constitution, which Biden’s people won’t believe in. You’ll see some real beauties if they put in the truth. That’s why they don’t want to do that, because you couldn’t win an election if you had to do that.

So I said, “Give me the top 25,” and then I went out and I played a little bit cute. I said, “All right, I will pick somebody like these people.” And you know what, that didn’t play. They said, “No, you have to pick one of these people, two of these.” And that’s what I did. I said, “All I’ll do that.” And they say that was 20 or 25 points in terms of the percentages of what I got. It was a big thing on the United States Supreme Court. Well, I’ve done it again. I’ve now taken my original list and we had two great people put, as you-

… original list. And we had two great people put as you know, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. And by the way, nobody’s ever suffered like Justice Kavanaugh, what he went through, nobody. But we put Justice, Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. They’re fantastic intellects, fantastic people. And now we have Amy to go along with it and it’s going to be unbelievable. Another week they’ll be voting. The full Senate will be voting. And I don’t know what can stop it because she’s so good. It’s a freight train, okay. But the fact is, so we’ll have three, but you know what Joe Biden has to tell you who. Because the next president, whoever it may be, it better be us, because if it’s not, honestly, you will not have the same country because the next president, the next term will have anywhere from one, two, three, and even four picks, very unusual.

I was very unusual at three. It’s a record for a term, but you know what? The next could have just by statistically one, two, three, or four. So your whole court as good as we’re doing now, and if I didn’t do this, you wouldn’t even have a 2nd Amendment. You wouldn’t have a 2nd Amendment, but if they put on two, three or four, that means they will override. And that’s good for 30, 40, 50 years. And the judges, they go in young and they last for a long time, which is nice. So Biden has to go out and he has to not only talk about not packing the court because anybody who wants to pack the court shouldn’t win. And Justice Ginsburg said that. She said, “No, the nine, we’re friendly, we get together. We’re for the country.”
 
She made the greatest case for nine. Once you get a big group of people, then you’re into the Senate, you’re into the House. We’ve already got that, right. And this is a great institution, maybe our greatest institution, and we can’t let some radical group of people destroy it. So number one, he can’t pack the court. And number two, he’s got to explain one of 25 or 30 or 40 or 50 people, but he’s got to put up a list of people from which he’ll choose. And the voters have to know who those people are and he can’t get away with I’ll tell you after the election and then destroy our country. He can’t do it. So that’s it. That’s it.

That’s much more interesting than going off a teleprompter when you think of that, but no, but you got to say it. You got to say it like it is. So Bidens’ agenda would be a catastrophe for North Carolina seniors and you know that better than anybody. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. People don’t know that about him, but he tried to cut your Social Security, great genius. He’s going to cut your Social Security and your Medicare. Now Biden’s pledging mass amnesty and free healthcare for illegal aliens. And you saw that three months ago when he’s on stage and he said to all of these very radical left candidates, “Who wants to give illegal aliens free healthcare?” And they all raise their hand and Biden didn’t and then you could see his right shoulder here it was the corpse. I say he’s the corpse. And his shoulder was… He was looking around, he didn’t know what the hell was happening, but he knew everyone else’s hand was up.

Remember that though? He knew it was wrong. Look, he’s been there for 47 years, hasn’t done a damn thing. He’s been there 40… He knew it was wrong, but his right shoulder started moving. And I said, “I just won the election.” I said, “Isn’t that nice?” And you know what? We all have a heart, but what that does is it brings millions of people into our country. They all want to get health care. They want to get education. They want to get all the things that they want to give them and you can’t do it. You can’t afford it, but that’s what they want So we’re not going to let that happen because it’ll decimate Medicare and destroy your Social Security and everything else. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security.

And under my leadership, we’re developing the vaccines and therapies and all of those things and you vote for me, prosperity is happening. Already it’s happening. It’s happening so fast nobody can believe it. We’re the number one country in the world by far for economic comeback and we went down less than any other country. Think of that. Normal life, that’s what we want. We want normal. I don’t want to talk. We want normal. We want to get back to where we were nine months ago, eight months ago. We want to have those football stadiums, those great teams of yours, we want to have people sitting next to each other screaming like crazy. You look at the stands where you have a person and then 20 empty seats. Nah, that’s not it. And we’ll be back. We’re going to be back very soon. Next year will be maybe the greatest economic year, one of the greatest economic years, but maybe the greatest economic year. I think better than last year. Last year was your best. I think we’re going to do better.

And to a large extent, this election’s about many things, but it’s between a Trump recovery and a Biden depression. Because if they get in, they’re going to raise your taxes quadruple. He says it. They’re going to allow millions of illegal aliens in, and they’re going to let regulations, all of the cutting that I’ve done in regulation, which is a number that no president has ever even come close to, whether they were four, eight, or in one case, more than that. They’re going to let all those regulations come back in. And the farmers know what I’m talking about and the tobacco growers know what I’m talking about because you couldn’t even farm your land. You had so many regulations. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate North Carolina’s economy with draconian, unscientific lock downs. He’ll keep you locked down except at a level that you’ve never seen before. You won’t have a state by the time this guy finishes up. Biden’s plan will crush America. My plan is already crushing the virus.

Look at our numbers, look at our numbers. This week, oh dammit. He must have lost his job. He must’ve been a nice guy. I’m sure he lost his job. This week, even the failing New York Times, the poor writer, I read this and I said, “This guy is gone, but I didn’t know him so what the heck.” The New York Times said that, this is the quote, experts are saying, “With genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than anybody ever expected.” How about that? New York Times. That’s right. The writer of that article is gone now, but may he rest in peace.

They don’t want to say that. They’re not happy to hear that because they don’t really have our interest at heart. Our early and aggressive action save so many lives, millions of lives. We pioneered all of these incredible therapies and reduced the fatality rate 80, think of it, 85%. We understand the disease and we have things that work and I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that wants it that has a problem free. And it’s free because it wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault and I only hope it works as well on you, but I’ll tell you, I felt like Superman a day later. Here I am. Here I am.

I actually looked at the doctor. He’s here with us now. Great doctors. We had so many doctors. I never saw so many doctors, all geniuses, lowest IQ 187. And they weren’t thrilled. But I looked at them and said, “I don’t know what the hell you gave me, but I want some more of it.” No, it was a transfusion. And it was amazing so we’re going to make that available to everybody. We’re trying to get it immediately approved by the FDA. And Dr. Han is working at the FDA to get it. And hopefully you don’t need it. And for the most part, you won’t need it. I think for the most part, but you need it. We’re going to get it to you, and you’re going to get it and you’re going to get better. And I call it a cure. They call it a therapeutic. I called it a cure, Regeneron.

And they have others that are very similar, great companies. I told you before, Eli Lilly, et cetera. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year. The vaccine will end the pandemic but it’s ending anyway. I mean, they go crazy when I say it. It’s going to peter out and it’s going to end, but we’re going to help the end and we’re going to make it a lot faster with the vaccine and with the therapeutics and frankly, with the cures. So we’re joined today by some incredible warriors and friends of ours, Congressman David Rouzer, where is he? David. David Rouzer. There’s our warrior. How are we doing David? We’re doing okay in this state? You’re doing good. Do you have any competition in the race? Any competition or not much?
I love that. I like when they say, “Not much, sir,” but if they have, I’m always there to help, right. I’m there to help. Thank you, David. Great job. We have a candidate for North Carolina, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Catherine Truitt. Catherine. Great. Great. Thank you. Good job, Catherine. I heard that. Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, who just recovered herself by the way. For anybody that’s sitting, look, they’re all jumping. Oh, she just recovered. Let’s get the hell out of here. No, Ronna’s great. Where is Ronna? Right here. Thank you Ronna. She’s great. She did a great job. She ran Michigan for us four years ago. She did so well. And many, many decades since the Republican won Michigan, and we won Michigan.

I said, “I want that person running the RNC. She’s great.” So Ronna, thank you very much. She just fully recovered from COVID. A lot of people are recovering. People are recovering 99%, 99 plus plus. And now with what you can do, one thing I do say, “Get there early. Get to the hospital early. Get there early.” They can do things. Lots of things, but don’t get there late. Get there early. And North Carolina GOP Chairman, a friend of ours, a great gentleman, Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. Great job. How are we doing? Doing all right? Looking like a good win, right? And are the numbers that big standing online getting ready to vote, right? Bigger than you anticipated? He’s saying the right things. Thank you Michael. No, I hear. It was broadcast today. The numbers are crazy. You know what it’s called? And this is what we’re going to have. We’re going to have a red wave. That’s what they call it.

They don’t want to send in the balance and have the balance thrown away into a dumpster. Who are you for, Trump? Get rid of that one, get rid. This is the craziest thing: they want to vote. Our people want to go and they want to vote. It’s going to be a big, beautiful red wave and let them put in their deal and we’ll check in every one of them. We’re watching very closely where they came from, where they went, how did they get there, right, all this stuff that’s going on. Not a day goes by when you don’t read about what crooked thing is happening, but the red wave will crush it. And those are people that are going to get there on November 3rd and previous to that, the open voting when you can vote, but they’re going to get there and people are talking about it already and you’re seeing that aren’t you? Huh? You’re seeing that. That’s great Michael. That’s great. It’s going to be a lot of fun because there was a landslide. Well, we’re going to see. We’re going to see, but we got a good shot.

No, we’re doing great in Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in Michigan. Doing great in Arizona. I heard some very good numbers just now in Nevada. We’re doing good. I mean, we’re doing good all over the place. And I don’t want to say it too loud because they get all this money. They’ll spend money like crazy, but ultimately, money doesn’t get you there because I spent 25% of what Crooked Hillary spent, right. I spent 25%. And even after I won, they said, “He didn’t do as good a job at fundraising.” I said, “I spent less money and I got criticized that we won.” My father taught me a long time ago if you can win for less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing, right? Good thing. Right Michael? Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we are doing it again. In my first three years, family income increased by $6, 000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of that.

So we did really more than eight times. African American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama, nine times. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment all reached in history, record highs. Highest in history, and we’re getting them all back. They’re all coming back. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. Since the China virus, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. We have never produced jobs at that level and that speed. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half and think of it, 7.8 7.9. That sounds terrible. But it sounds pretty good when they’re telling you about the 42%, right? Because I figured 42, what are you going to do? We have this crazy situation that happened and 7.8%, it’s a pretty incredible when you think about it and we’ll get that way down and it’s going down fast. Well, yeah, just watch this. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in their crisis. It wasn’t a crisis though.

It was not great times, but it wasn’t a crisis. We did it in five months. So they had 30 months and they had the weakest recovery in the history of our country dating back actually to when they started 1929. It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country and then he wants to tell us how to do things. For 47 years, he did nothing. I love these guys. For 47 years he did nothing, now all of a sudden he wants to do all these things that I did already. I could do better. You shouldn’t have let China in. Well, for two months he was saying I was xenophobic because I closed the borders very early didn’t I, huh? Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama Biden recovery. 23 times. Not 23%, 23 times. And these numbers come from the great Larry Kudlow, who’s a good man by the way. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over us for 47 years. Think of it. Biden has waged the decades-long assault on your state against your state’s tobacco growers.

He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was a disaster, TPP, which would have been a disaster had I not terminated. It would have destroyed your state. It would have destroyed manufacturing in our country and he was totally in favor of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. That’s when they took off like a rocket, but not so good anymore. For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of North Carolina workers. He should not be asking for your votes, he should be begging for your forgiveness. That’s what he should be doing. What a job he did. I mean, you go back four or five years, you people were hurting. You were hurting. I have plenty of friends in this state. You were hurting. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders, countries you never heard of. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA.
That’s probably the main reason I ran in the first place. And I made this statement the other day and it sort of made sense to me. If Obama and Biden did a good job, I would have never run. I mean, think. I only ran because they did a horrible job and there was no unity. You had Ferguson. Look at what happened in St. Louis. Look at what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened in Oakland. Look at what happened. There was hatred all over the place. Now they say, “Oh, wasn’t that beautiful.” What they did was they did a terrible job. That’s why I’m your president. Because if they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. I had a very nice life, believe me. And by the way, how many of these rallies have you? Stand up, please. North Carolina. What number is this? Don’t be embarrassed.
60. They have a group of 12 women and I see them a lot. And I say, “North Carolina, they remind me of that no matter where we go.” And so 60, that’s a lot, but that’s only about 20%. So you have a long way to… I’m sure their husbands are thrilled. Where are you going? I’m going to, well, at least here you’re close, right?
We like him. We like him. Great women. Thank you very much. That’s really nice. Now, that’s really nice. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA, which is just now kicking in and it’s turned out to be incredible for our farmers, our manufacturers. Everyone said it couldn’t be done. There’s no way you could end NAFTA. I ended it. It was one of the worst trade deals ever made. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. We’ve achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our pristine environment. We have the best environmental numbers we’ve ever had, meaning I guess over 50 years because before that you didn’t have too much action, right?

But we have the best environmental numbers, ozone numbers, so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India, all these countries, they’re spewing stuff into the air. I keep telling our people. I say, “I love clean air, but Russia and China,” you look at a map. You have all these spots and India and many others are spewing it in. What do you suggest? Well, we don’t think you should sell straws anymore. Oh, great. Okay. That’s going to help. You ever hear that? The straw, right? And I say, “Okay, the straw is good. That’s a little straw. That’s okay. What about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that’s out of plastic?” Well, we’ll get to that later. These people are crazy. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. So you don’t have to worry about any oil spills in your beautiful land. You don’t have to worry. Look how happy she is. She obviously lives on the water. You don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it…

I don’t have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it so great for energy. We’ve never had energy like we do. We’re number one in the world now by far, and totally energy independent. In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American.

I saw a Biden the other day. He’s standing here like this. And he’s got a sign, “Hire American.” I said, “I’ve been saying that for 15 years.” It’s amazing. And you know this one, when the Tennessee Valley Authority replaced part of its American workforce with foreign workers, I told the board chairman, “Chairman, you’re fired. Out. You’re fired, chairman.” You know what he was making? This had nothing to do with me. He was making $8 million a year. He’s the highest paid government official. Semi-government. It’s like a private, semi-private deal. $8 million a year. And I said, “You’re fired.” And what happened is, as soon as I said that they hired all the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. Mississippi

They’re all back, and they were great. They were great. So we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great. My opponent’s immigration plan is the most extreme in the history of our country. Biden’s plan would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release. That’s catch… A murderer comes over, you catch him. What do you do? Well, not much. Most of them don’t say they killed people. You catch them, you take their name, and you release them into our country. It was a big deal. It sounds easy. I ended it. But you want to see tough? Go through courts, goes through… But I ended it. I ended catch and release.

One of the worst things. Now we release them. You know where we release them? We release them back into their country. We don’t release them into our country anymore. We say, “Congratulations, we’ve got them.” Look at all those people standing up out there. Wow, sorry. Sorry we didn’t get you seats. Well, they’re strong. They’re strong people. They’re from North Carolina. Making every community into a sanctuary city, this is their goal. And suspending all removals of any illegal alien, no matter how bad they are. Murderers, rapists. They have a deal with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. He lost twice. Greatest loser of all time. He lost the first time and he took it, then he lost the second time. Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out, I’d be running against him. That would be okay. I don’t care. There’d be more energy. Smaller base, more energy.

But it happened twice to Bernie. But I would really be watching it very careful because it would be the total nullification of US borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have this country, and what would happen would be our country would be overwhelmed with illegal immigration coming in. Your jobs, crime would go through the roof. And now, as I said, we have the strongest southern border in the history of our country. Over 400 miles of wall.

Wall will be completed very soon. MS-13 and criminal cartels would have rampaged freely all over the country if it wasn’t for ICE and border patrol, so we’ve gotten rid of thousands of MS013. We delivered them back out of our country. We said, “Congratulations. Here they are. You take them. We’re not taking them.” These are some bad people. If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone, and your safety is gone. It’s very simple. Biden has pledged with Bernie Sanders, they made agreement. You know what it is? They all agreed to a thing. We call it the manifesto. My idea. It’s called the manifesto.

He’s pledged to eliminate our requirement that newcomers to our society be financially self-reliant. We want them to be able to make a pledge that they’re not going to take from us, and he’ll provide unlimited welfare, he wants to, for anybody anywhere in the world that comes into our country. I said, “That’s a great idea. Where are we going to get the money, Sleepy Joe?” Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing the wall. We’re up to now 407, I think. 406, 407. We’re doing 10 miles a week. Nobody believes it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US Military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared to more than $1 billion a year, many times what it was. And by the way, all made in the USA. We have the greatest machinery ever made by any nation in history. Russia, China, every one of them. They’re all jealous. What we have is not even to be talked about.

I actually mentioned this in a rally about two months ago and they said, “He’s giving away information.” Now I’m not. I’m telling you something. We’ve got stuff that they dream about, all made in the USA. $2.5 trillion. And you know what? Hope to God… We’ve redone our nuclear. When number one in the world by far. It was going down the tubes. It was old and tired, but hope to God we never have to use it. Remember when I came in? They said, “With his personality, we’ll be in a war in the first week.” Where’s the war? Where’s the way? Remember? You would’ve have been in a war without me, because North Korea, we were going to have a nice nuclear war with North Korea. And now I get along great with him. And everyone says, “Oh, that’s terrible” that I get along. No, it’s a good thing. Getting along is a good thing, not a bad thing. And you get along through strength, not through weakness. You never get along through weakness.

And we launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces, and I never even talked. When I came to North Carolina and talked to you, I never said this. So we actually did more than I promised. I’m the only politician, if you’d call me that. I’m the only politician that actually did more than I promised, because I never talked about the Space Force. I never talked about it, right? And as I sat for a year and I watched and I saw what was going on with Russia and with China and with others, I said, “Wait a minute, we’re going to fall away behind. We can’t do that.” And we launched the Space Force. And Jim Inhofe and some of the people in the Senate were fantastic, and the House. And we got it passed, so we have… First time in 75 years, think of that, a new force. And it’s a big force, and it’s an important one. We passed VA Choice for our veterans and VA Accountability for our veterans. Nobody thought that could happen. 42 years.

And we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate. When I came in, it was a mess. They were all over the place. We took over 100% and we killed the leader of ISIS and founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were after him for 15 years. And we took out the world’s number one terrorist, the mass murder of many American troops and many other troops and many other people, Kasseem Salamoni is dead. And I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous $150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash. Can you believe it? Five plane loads of cash. Figure that one. The Iran nuclear deal, a disaster. And you know the first call I’m going to get after we win? It’s going to be from Iran. “Can we make a deal?” Because their country’s going to hell with the sanctions and all of the things we’ve done, and they want to make a deal.

I said, “Why don’t you wait till after the election?” I said, “But if you wait until after the election, it is going to be much tougher.” But I said, “Wait until after the election,” because you can’t make a deal now. You’ve going to see if sleepy Joe… Because if sleepy Joe gets in you’ll make the greatest deal ever made. And China will own us. Remember what I said. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Got it built. And we got it built, Mr. Congressman. We got it built.

They wanted $2 billion to build it. I said, “Maybe we could do cheaper.” I said to my people, I said, “You know this story. Find something. Maybe we own some land.” We did. It had a building on it. So we were going to spend $2 billion. I said, “Well, let’s renovate the existing building. Is it big enough?” “Oh, it’s too big, actually.” “And how’s the location?” “Much better than the one we were going to buy in Jerusalem.” I said, “Alright, come back with a price.” David Friedman, who’s one of the most successful lawyers. Now he’s the ambassador to Israel. So he calls me up two days later, he says, “Sir, I think we can do it for $350,000.”

I said, “David.” From $2 billion. I said, “Well, what’s the difference between the $2 billion version and the $350,000?” He said, “Sir, honestly the $350,000 will have a better location, a better building. It’s actually better.” Now, who would believe stories like this? And I actually told him, I did something I don’t think, congressman, I’ve ever done in my life. I said, “David, it’s too cheap. It doesn’t sound good. Make it more expensive, please.” So we made it $500,000. Not bad, right? And we opened it up a few months later. So not only did we name Jerusalem, became the capital of Israel. We got the building built. This thing would’ve taken 10 years, 20 years. Would’ve cost $5 billion. It would have been ridiculous. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, they’ve been fighting over that for 52 years.

And instead of endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle-East. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy your social security, and he would destroy all preexisting conditions. And you know it, and so does he. Biden’s running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private healthcare. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He’s agreed to this with crazy Bernie, by 700%. Think of that. Does that sound reasonable? Opening the flood Gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I said, “No, thank you.” He wants to ban school choice and charter schools. And in a second term, and I’ve already started, we will provide school choice to every parent in America. One of the most important things.

A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and limitless future. A limitless future for all Americans. And just in concluding, first of all it’s great to be with you on this gorgeous day. This is beautiful. Been a great state. My granddaughter, you what happened, right? You know the name of my granddaughter? Carolina. Carolina. Am I allowed to say that to South Carolina? Because I love them too. Can I maybe do a… Am okay with that? Can I have your approval? It’s Carolina. Beautiful. Over the next four years, we’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China. We’ve already started, we’re well on our way. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, foolish, stupid foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Already signed, hits in January 1st. Don’t give Biden the credit for it, please. He won’t even know what it is. He’ll say, “What did I do?” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs at levels that you’ve never seen before. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We’ll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’ll be soon. And NASA is now the number one space center in the world by far. And it was virtually abandoned when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.

We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” And that won’t be changed. They took the word God out of the pledge of allegiance and they got absolutely decimated. They put it back. They said, “No, no we didn’t it.” And then they took it out a couple of other times. That’s the way they’re going, but it’s not going to happen. Not even going to come close. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina.

So again, this is the most important election of our lives, maybe in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get out and vote. The red wave is coming. The red wave is coming. And remember, early voting starts, guess when? Today. So go down there. From Wilmington to Winston-Salem, from Asheville to Charlotte, from Greensboro to right here in Greenville, we inherit the legacy of North Carolina patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We love our nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, and we are returning it faster than anyone ever thought possible.

With your help, your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We’re proud. We will make America safe again, quickly. And we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. Go out and vote.",15/10/2020
" Thank you. What a nice group. Thank you very much. Beautiful, thank you.
Thank you very much, please. We are going to be talking to our great senior citizens, that’s what I’m here for today.
We love our senior citizens. And I’m honored to be here in Fort Myers to reaffirm my solemn pledge to America’s seniors, it’s so important to me, I happen to be a senior. I will protect you, I will defend you, and I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and conviction that I have. You devoted your life to this country and I am devoting my life to you. My administration is working every day to give our amazing senior citizens the care, support, and respect that you deserve, and you understand that, we’ve worked together for a long time. As president, I’m deeply aware that America’s 54 million seniors have borne the heaviest burden of the China virus. Many older Americans have endured months of isolation, missing weddings, births, graduations, church, and family reunions, you know that very well, you know it all too well. My heart breaks for every grieving family that has lost a precious loved one, I feel their anguish, and I mourn their loss, I feel their pain.

I know that the terrible pain that they have gone through, and you lose someone, and there’s nothing to describe what you have to bear, there’s nothing to describe it. In times of challenge, we turn to our fellow Americans for a shoulder to lean on and we turn to God for healing and strength, and together we will overcome. My message to America’s seniors today is one of optimism, confidence, and hope. Your sacrifice has not been in vain. The light at the end of the tunnel is near. We are rounding the turn, I say that all the time, some of the media doesn’t like hearing it, but I say it all the time, we’re rounding that turn. Don’t listen to the cynics, and angry partisans, and professional pessimists, we are Americans and we will prevail, we are prevailing, and we are… It’s amazing what’s happening, if you look at what’s going on, it’s been really very amazing.

I’m moving heaven and earth to safeguard our seniors from the China virus to deliver life-saving therapies in record time and to distribute a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year, and we’re really doing it even sooner than that, you see what’s going on, we have the vaccines getting ready to go. Seniors will be the first in line for the vaccine and we will soon be ending this pandemic, hasn’t happened a thing like this since 1918, 1917, that was a bad one too, that was a real bad one. I will not rest until we’ve eradicated this plague from our country, and our lives, and our world, we want it out. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. Our aggressive and early action saved more than 2 million lives compared to the best estimates from last spring, you remember when they were giving you estimates.

Since the beginning, our nation’s seniors have been my top priority, it was obvious very early on that it was affecting the seniors not young people. Young people are… They have that strong immune system and I give all credit to them, but they have a strong immune system, and 99.99, think of that. But, when you get into people that have a few more years, it’s a little bit more difficult, when you get a lot more years, it’s a lot more difficult. But, what they’ve done with therapeutics now and what they’ve done with all of the other things that they’re doing, it’s incredible. We heightened mitigation and surge testing to protect those at highest risk. We sent billions and billions of dollars in funding to personal protective equipment and distributed rapid testing to 15,400 nursing homes all over the country.

We’ve worked with a lot of governors and some have done a great job, and some have done not a great job, and some have done a very poor job, actually, but some have done a great job, but we’re working very closely with the governors of the states. Just this week, even the New York Times, this was shocking, was forced to admit that ‘experts are saying with genuine confidence that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than they expected’. And they’re right, but I was shocked to hear coming out of the New York Times, right? I was a little [ 00:05:55], and it’s thanks to my administration’s Operation Warp Speed, incredible people. Because of advances in treatment we pioneered, and we have many treatments, but because of these great advances, we’ve reached the point where the fatality rate is reduced by 85% since April and now it’s up to probably 91%. Well, I’m here, I tell you.
Thank you. Well, I don’t know what they gave me, but give me some more of it right now and you can have some too. No, I know exactly what that gave, it was actually pretty amazing. I’m also working with the FDA and HHS to make the antibody treatment that I received, it’s called Regeneron plus… Also, it’s incredible, and what they can do today is incredible. And they felt very confident even six months ago when they started, think of it, we got this all done in a very short period of time and now we’re going for emergency use, because we’re going to make it available to everyone who needs it for free, anybody in the country. And Eli Lilly is making a very similar drug, and Alex, they’re working very hard on that, right? Alex Azar, so thank you very much, because I want people to get it and we’re getting it free, right? So, we got to do that. If you need it, if you don’t need it, that’s even better, okay? That’s even better, but if you need it, right? You get it.

It’s really pretty amazing what happened, because I wasn’t feeling great and the next day I wake up and I’m saying, “Who can I fight today?” Thank you. So, our groundbreaking therapies have significantly improved and improved our outcomes for elderly patients, but I’ll not relent until all American seniors are safe, you’re going to be safe, a hundred percent safe, and we’re at a point where really so much progress has been made. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to deliver at least 100 million doses of a vaccine this year, and could even be a little bit sooner than what they were originally anticipating, with hundreds of millions more to quickly follow, Alex, remember that Alex. Today, I’m thrilled to announce that we have just finalized a partnership with CVS and Walgreens, two places you know pretty well, I guess, to immediately deliver the vaccine directly to nursing homes at no cost to our seniors, right? No cost.

These are very effective, once you have that vaccine you can open those doors and say, “Here I am.” But with everything that I say and everything I do, if you feel safer at home… And we can all be like, ” Let’s get out there.” And I felt as president, I knew there was risk, but I had to be out, I can’t just be locked in a basement, to put it… Lock them in a basement. I felt I had to be out there, I would see Gold Star families, and I’ve been looking forward for months to come into the White House, and many, many other people, military people and heads of state. And I know you put yourself at risk, but you can’t… You have to lead your life. But I say this, there are people also that would rather stay in place, stay where you are, and to those people, and I understand that very well, stay, just relax, stay until it’s gone, and it’ll be gone, but stay. Don’t feel badly or don’t feel good about it, just stay, if you feel safe, stay.

I’m working as hard as I can so you can kiss and hug your children and grandchildren very soon, that’s something I missed also, I will be honest with you. As we shelter high-risk Americans with extreme vigilance, we must also allow lower-risk Americans to return to work and return to school. I mean, children should go to school. My young son, Baron, had it, and he had it, and all of a sudden he doesn’t have it, it’s like… It was different, it’s a whole different deal, and they should go to school, and they have to, because… I talk about the cure, right? It cannot be worse than the problem itself, it’s a very simple statement, but the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. And with young children, they have to go to school, they have to be with other kids, they have to grow up, they can’t lose a year of their life. And if you look at some of these lockdowns that the Democrats are doing in some states, if you look at North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, and Michigan, we won the case against her in Michigan.

I mean, she’s running like a prison except for her husband who’s allowed to go boating, that doesn’t work out somehow. Fortunately, they caught him, he was going to go on the lake boating, that’s nice, but nobody else was allowed to do it. But we won the case against her for Michigan, and we freed up the state, and it’s a great thing, I mean, it’s a great thing, we freed up the state. Because that whole thing with drugs, and alcohol, and depression and all of the horrible things, we could go over a long list of things, but we can’t let that happen. So, we want the Democrat, radical left, in many cases, Democrats, we wanted to open their states, open up your states, and we’re very careful with our seniors, and that’s different, but open up your states, get it back.

Despite punishing society-wide lockdowns in Europe, I don’t know if you’ve been watching, they’re now experiencing a massive surge in cases. Daily cases are 2500% higher in the United Kingdom, as an example, and 722% higher in Europe than in the United States, okay? No, think of that. And we wish them… And we’re working with them closely, we’re making ventilators for them. For many of the countries over there, we became the ventilator king. I mean, we didn’t have many ventilators, we had… Really, we inherited bare cupboards, I said the cupboards were bare, in many of the states they had… Cupboards were bare, and now they’re loaded up and they’re ready…

Cupboards were bare. And now they’re loaded up and they’re ready. But the hardest thing are the ventilators because of the complexity of the machine, and the cost, the size, but the pure complexity. And we make thousands of ventilators now a month and we’re sending them all over the world. We’re all set with the ventilators but we’re sending them all over the world. But hopefully you won’t need them. Soon you won’t even need them. I really think you’re going to not need the ventilators, hopefully soon, very soon. But sadly in Europe, the average daily deaths are really soaring. 402% higher in the United Kingdom. 493% higher in Europe. Meanwhile, in the United States deaths have decreased by 37%. So that’s something, right.

The fake news doesn’t want to tell you that, right? They want no piece of that. They don’t want anything to do with that. So whether you’re Republican or Democrat, we must use facts over fear. We have to. Science over hysteria, hope over despair, and the common good over partisan politics. And again, if you feel good, if you feel safe because it’s going to be gone, stay where you are. Don’t leave. Don’t say, “Oh gee, I have to get out.” The President said, “Let’s get out.” Stay where you are. I have a lot of friends, they’re strong people. They’re senior citizens. Great people, very successful people. Hi. Look, she’s waving. Hi. Thank you. Thank you, hun.

But you know they’re tough actually, but they feel comfortable until this has gone and there are people, and I do that. Do that. I might do that. If I weren’t in this position, maybe I’d be doing it myself. In this position, it’s a little tougher. But we cannot allow unscientific, panic driven, fear-based policies to deny our children and grandchildren their future, and their dreams. We can’t take a year or two years out of their lives. There’s a whole social thing going on there too.

These left wing lock downs will crush America, and my plan is very simple. We’re going to crush the virus and go back to exactly where we were. We’re almost getting back there now. So together, we will end this pandemic. We will rebuild our economy and we will ensure our seniors can live long, happy, secure, and healthy lives with your grandchildren and your children. You’re going to hug them, right? It’s good. Under my leadership next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country economically. We’re grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. Alex, we’re counting on you. We’re counting… I’m going to blame him if this stuff doesn’t happen fast, right?

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, a fantastic woman, Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you, Seema. Great job you’re doing. A friend of mine who’s become very, very popular, I guess that was what that big applause was. I was backstage, I said, “Who just came in?” I thought Elvis entered the room. It was your Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis. Stand up. That’s great, Ron. Great.

And by the way, we have some crowd. You see what’s going on outside? The mayor said, “He’s never seen anything like that. He’s never seen anything.” Now there’s a lot of love outside. I want to tell you. That’s a lot of love and we’re leading in the State of Florida, just so we understand. By perhaps a lot. Also with some warriors, Representatives Gus Bilirakis. Gus, Gus, great job, Gus. And another friend of mine, these are really terrific people, Greg Stube. Greg, thank you very much, Greg. Thank you. Thanks as well to Fort Myers, Mayor Randy Henderson. Randy. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Good job, Randy. That’s quite a crowd, huh?
That’s good. Thank you very much. And Cape Coral Mayor Joe Coviello. Joe Coviello. Thank you, Joe. Great job. Great job. We’re also tremendously honored to be joined by World War II and Korean War veteran, a very brave guy, Wally Cortese. Wiley Cortese. Thank you, Wally. You look good, Wally. I’ll tell you, two wars and you’re looking good. Thank you, Wally. Appreciate it. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Thanks also to all of the members of the VFW Golden Gate Honor Guard, they’re with us today. Thank you. That’s so great. That’s so great. VFW. Fantastic job. Thank you very much for being here. As I fight to protect our amazing seniors from the China virus, I’m also fighting to protect you from another danger. One, which threatens everything we cherish, value and worked our entire lives to build and to defend. As we gathered today, seniors are under threat from a radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. We’re not going to allow it. And you know one thing, sleepy Joe and do nothing about it. The left has been taken over by socialists and Marxists and extremists and they have. They want to transform our nation into a country that would no longer be recognizable. And their agenda will shatter America’s seniors, their plan to delay the vaccine, delay therapies and prolong the pandemic will cost thousands and thousands of lives, will be horrifying for our country.

They are planned for higher taxes. They want to quadruple taxes. Every company will move out. They’ll go back to where they came. We had tremendous people, tremendous companies come into our country. We’re bring in tremendous jobs, 160 million jobs, we’ve never had anything like it, before the plague and then we’re building it back up again. Last four months, we’ve set records on employment, on hiring employment. And a number that, let’s say a year ago, wouldn’t have sounded great, but now sounds incredible, 7.8% unemployment. Think of it. People were talking about 42%. We’re back down to 7.8 and we’ll be soon down to the number where we were, seven months ago. Pretty amazing.

I never thought I’d be happy with 7.8%, but you know when you think about it, right, they were talking 39%, 42%. Ron, 7.8 is a pretty amazing thing. We did that in a rapid fashion. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, actually. They’re planned for higher taxes and crippling regulations, however, would crater our economy. Their insane energy policies because you know they’re going to be fracking. Hey, Biden for a year and a half is saying there will be no fracking. Then he looks out, he gets the nomination because Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So Bernie, a second time, that happened twice to Bernie. Bernie, he’s a hell of a loser. That’s one thing I’ll say. He knows how to lose. He knows how to lose. He loses he goes back to work like nothing happened. No, they took it away from him twice. I think the second time in a way worse, because she stayed in, she took the votes and sleepy Joe just got in there. That’s why you got to be careful. You got to be careful. You never know what happens.

But if you take a look and we can’t let any of this stuff happen. And you look at what’s happened to other countries, where they’ve had this philosophy, where they’ve had this ideology. We can’t let… But you watch what they’re saying about the fracking, where he said no, and he said it with such… It’s not like, “Well, I’ll think about it.” He’s doing the same thing with the courts right now. They’re going to pack the Supreme Court. You see what they want to do. Would be destruction of our country. But you take a look. So he says, “No, there will be no fracking.” These are the words. “There will be no fracking. You don’t understand what I just said. There will be no fracking.” And then he gets very agitated. “There would be no fracking.”

And he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania, they inform him that they have a million jobs and fracking’s a big deal. And they like inexpensive energy, right? And so, he goes from, “There will be no fracking with great anger”, to “I never said they wouldn’t be fracking.” It’s the craziest thing. If that ever happened to me and the media doesn’t even talk about it. That’s just one of many things. Then he does that thing with the courts. You see that, right? He goes, “I’ll tell you after the election what I’m going to do.” How important is it? Because he’s going to put on radical, left, crazy judges that will destroy your lives. It’s the most important. They’ve always said… I’ve always heard, Ron, I’ve always heard this, that the most important thing a president does is pick Supreme Court Justices, right? I would say maybe the military, but let’s say it’s right there. And he has to create a list of more than just that, he has to create a list and let you know and he has to pick from that list. That’s what I did. I created a list of 25 people, highly, highly capable people. And a lot of people said, that’s why I won the election, actually. So I don’t know if that’s true or not. But it was a very important part, Mary, you understand mayors, you know that.

So their insane energy policies will abolish millions of jobs and cost seniors thousands of dollars per year in higher energy bills. Their anti-police agenda will empower violent mobs and put every community at risk. Their anti-suburban agenda threatens the property values of millions of American seniors and your families, who own homes in residential neighborhoods, in the suburbs. I’m saving the suburbs. People saying, “Well, women in the suburbs, do they like Trump?” I said, “Yeah, they liked me. You know why they like, because I’m saving their homes.” That’s why they like me. They may not like me, but they like what I’m doing, and that’s more important.

Oh boy, they have these crazy people. The people on television, I don’t know if suburban women, suburban women want security. They want safety. They want law and order. They want their homes to be protected. The socialist ideology that they will use and indoctrinate our youth with is like poisonous Anti-American propaganda.

The plan by Washington Democrats to give amnesty and free healthcare to illegal border crossers will obliterate Medicare, bankrupt your social security, robbing you of the benefits that you’ve paid for your entire lives. Look, take a look at Venezuela. People don’t realize, that was a wealthy country 18, 17 years ago. It was so wealthy. And it’s gone from being wealthy, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have food, they don’t have water. They don’t have anything. And it can happen here, just a much larger version with that ideology. And that’s the ideology that they’re looking at. It’s crazy.

These radicals will destroy Medicare with totally open borders. And by the way, you know the wall, it’s up to almost 400 miles. 400. 400 miles. And it goes down deep, tunneling. It goes down deep and up very high. Now it’s had a tremendous… We’ve never had a stronger Southern border than we have right now. It’ll be finished very soon. We’re doing 10 miles a week. That’s a lot. 10 miles a week. Army Corps of Engineers are also doing Lake Okeechobee and lots of other things, right? They’re doing a good job, right? They’re giving away your benefits, that’s what-

They’re giving away your benefits, that’s what they want to do to anyone in the world who trespasses into our country. And we all have big hearts and we want to take care of people. But when you say, “We’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to give you college education.” I sarcastically said once, “We’re going to give you a beautiful brand new Rolls-Royce. Okay? If you’re an illegal immigrant. And CNN went and they said, “The President lied to the seniors.” They just don’t get it. They get it. Actually, unfortunately they get it more than you would think. They’re a little bit on the evil side.

But, you’re going to bring millions of people … You’re going to bring millions and millions of people. It’s like, when you say, “Free healthcare, and free education, and free this and that,” millions of people are going to pour into the country. It’s not going to be stoppable. And we can’t let that happen. They care more about illegal aliens than they care about senior citizens, the Democrats. The left is coming after me because I’m defending you. And that’s true. That’s why they come after me. Every day they come … But we caught them on the Russian hoax. We finally caught them after two and a half years. Russia knows. Turned out to be the exact opposite. They’re the ones that were playing with Russia. That was a beauty. Hillary … Crooked Hillary. Now they’re the ones. Yeah, I agree with you. I used to just be quiet. And I agree with you 100%. Millions and millions of dollars they paid. And they tried to show it. It was the greatest hoax and the greatest political crime in the history of our country. That’s what they committed. But I’m the only one standing between their open borders and extremism and the healthcare benefits that you’ve earned and paid for. All your life, you paid for. As long as I’m President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare or your social security. As a candidate, I made a sacred promise that I’d strengthen, protect and defend your Medicare benefits. And that’s exactly what I’ve done. I’ve done that, right?

My administration’s fought to deliver greater security, affordability, fairness, economic stability to our nation’s seniors. Under eight years of the previous administration, premiums for Medicare health plans went up including a 25% increase right here in Florida. That’s for the previous people. Under my administration, we’ve lowered Medicare Advantage premiums by a number nobody even believes, 34% nationwide. And today, it’s the lowest level in 14 years. Did you know that, Ron? That’s not a bad thing for you to put into your speech, right? Who would think that? No, but seriously, we’ve brought it way down. This group over here, they’ve done a great job. Thanks to our efforts, there are 2,000 … Thank you.

There are 2,000 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were three years ago. That’s incredible. Think of that. That means more choice and more competition for better care at a much lower cost. When we rapidly expanded telehealth for Medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic, the number of tele-health users increased from 14,000 a week to 1.7 million a week. What’s that percentage? Yet, all of this danger, it’s all in danger because if these other people get in, they will end all of that. The telehealth … It’s interesting. We’ve learned something for children, they’re much better in a classroom than they are on a laptop. Okay? Children.

But for your health and what you can do, you can do so much of it, such a big percentage, better than going out and going through … This telehealth has been amazing. It’s been really incredible. It’s been an incredible thing. It’s increased like six, 7,000, I think 6500%. And it’s probably the only thing that came out of this whole deal that we really can take pleasure at, telehealth. It’s been really an incredible thing that’s happened. Over 130 Democrats in Congress, including far left Senator Kamala Harris, who is the most … I said, “He’ll never choose her because nobody treated him worse than her. Nobody.” Plus, her poll numbers were sinking. She never even got to Iowa. She never got there. And when I said, “Oh … ”

And by the way, didn’t Mike Pence do a good job the other night? Right? Good man. Did a great job. And I had a great … Thank you. Really, I had a lot of fun last night with that. That was a nice evening. It was a nice pleasurable evening. I had somebody going totally crazy last night. “But, I told you … I told you that.” She told me? She’s going to … Oh, okay. I believe you, right? No, but I understand that worked out very well last night. That’s what the word is, so that’s good. Another evening in paradise, I call it. They’re sponsoring a socialist healthcare plan that would annihilate your Medicare. The Democrats’ policy proposals may go by different names. They put all sorts of names. They say single payer, or so-called the public option.

But really, they’re all based on the same core promise, raiding Medicare to fund a socialist healthcare takeover. And it’s going to destroy your Medicare. That’s the one thing you know for sure. Every one of their plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, extending wait times and massively raising your taxes. Other than that, it’s actually quite good. As we know from seeing these left wing policies in action around the world, seniors will be the victims. And that’s what happens, the first to go are the seniors, the victims are really the seniors. This is nothing that unique. Socialist healthcare plans always end up denying care and coverage to the sick and the elderly in order to control costs.

And they always feel that this is the easiest way to do it. We must not let them bring this lethal and deadly agenda to America. Don’t let it happen. Got to vote them out. Get out and vote. Democrat healthcare proposals would abolish private insurance for 180 million Americans. Just so you know, there are many people, they’ve had a good life, they’ve done well. They have private plans. They are unbelievable. They love their plan. Those plans are gone. Those plans are gone. They’d abolish the Medicare Advantage program that benefits 24 million seniors, including one out of two Hispanic seniors and one out of three African-American seniors who enrolled in the Medicare Advantage. Right?

And that will all be ended. It would be abolished, for big fat, ugly socialized medicine. You go to a hospital, you don’t feel good. Go to a hospital room and wait for three days to see a doctor. I will never allow that to happen. Under my administration, your Medicare Advantage is safe. Your benefits are protected. And I will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always, always, always. They always play that card, right? Remember they used to say, “Oh, he’s going to give up.” At first they said I was going to be in a war within the first week. Whatever happened to that, right? Just the opposite. Our great warriors are coming home. They’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. You’re welcome.

Look at North Korea, they thought would be a war and a war immediately with North Korea. How’s that worked out, right? It’s worked out very nicely. Talk, we’ll talk, keep talking. But it worked out very well. But the other thing they said, “He will destroy your social security.” Really? Did I? I said, “No.” No, they’re going to destroy it, because they’ll destroy our country. They’ll destroy your social security and they’ll destroy your country. And Joe won’t have any idea what happened, because he’s gone. Let’s face it. He’s gone. Another critical issue for senior citizens is the price of prescription drugs. This is something I’m very proud of, because we’ve lowered Part D prescription drug premiums by 12%, saving senior citizens $1.9 billion.
 
But the biggest yet to come, I stood up to big pharma, and that’s not easy. They got big money. They’re the biggest lobbyist in this country by far. And I signed an executive order, implemented a most favorite nations policy for the United States. For years you’ve heard, “We pay more for drugs than any other country.” Well, that’s not even close. We pay much more. And in other countries that we know very well take advantage of us and they pay a fraction. I mean, you wouldn’t even believe how much less, but a fraction. 25 cents for a pill, as opposed to $2 for a pill. Same pill from the same lab plant, right? And I instituted a favorite nations clause. I said, if Germany or some other country is getting our stuff low, I want a favored nations. Meaning, I want it for the same price. And they have gone crazy.

I have never seen so many ads. They put on more ads against me now than sleepy Joe Biden, I’m telling you, and they understand. Look, it should have been done a long time ago. This should’ve been done years ago. Plus, I got rid of the middleman and I gave Ron DeSantis the right to go to Canada in the meantime, because I think eventually you’ll be using this. But in the meantime, you’ll also be getting the rebates. Okay? Rebates, you know who they go to? The middlemen. You know how rich the middlemen are? I’m rich. These guys blow everyone away. I don’t know … Nobody even knows who the hell they are. Did you ever hear … Does anybody know a middleman? I would like to meet. It’s Biden’s son. It’s Hunter. Oh, it’s Hunter. I’ll bet you Hunter is a middleman. He’s collecting …

He’s like a vacuum cleaner, he follows his father around collecting. What a disgrace. It’s a crime family. You want to know something? It’s a crime family. He’s following his father. Hunter Biden is a middleman. Oh, that’s wild. No, these people are amazing. These middlemen, you’re right. Hunter made no money until his father became Vice President and now he’s like a vacuum cleaner. His father goes to Germany, Hunter’s right there. “Hey, give me a couple of million.” Not a couple of million. Hell of a lot more than a couple of million. That’s a shame. I’ll tell you what, it’s an organized crime family, as far as I’m concerned. I capped out of pocket costs … And the way they get protected by big tech and by the media, the media doesn’t want to ask … This is the hottest subject there is right now.

And I didn’t watch sleepy Joe last night. I just wanted to see what he looked like. He wasn’t looking too good. I just couldn’t watch, it was too painful. But, they didn’t … I understand that they did not ask him a question about this. Can you believe it? Now, think of it. And Stephanopoulos interviewed me two weeks ago and he was nasty. He was nasty. I mean, he was tough. He’s a tough guy.

I watched last night, the little stuff I watched and what I heard, it was like softballs, every … But he didn’t … This is the hottest subject there is. They didn’t ask them one question about their corruption in the family. They didn’t ask him one question about how big tech is protecting him. Big tech is not allowing anybody to … How about this? They took down, I guess, Kayleigh, but they took … How about Kayleigh? Isn’t she great? No, but they took down her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up-

… on her Twitter site because she had the audacity to put up an article written in the New York Post, which is one of the biggest newspapers in the country. I think it’s the oldest newspaper in the country. They put up a article, and they took down her site. Can you believe what’s going on in this country? And then they talk about freedom of the press. They also said last night, it was very interesting, they talked about the transition, the friendly transition. Will you agree to the friendly … Of course the answer is yes. First of all, I don’t think there’s going to be a transition because we’re going to win but … Let’s hope we don’t have to worry about it. No, but think of this. They get up, “We demand a friendly transition.” Yet, we caught them spying on my campaign, and trying to take down the president of the United States. Right? That wasn’t too friendly. Right? That wasn’t too friendly, and we caught them cold.

Anyway, let’s get back to the medical parts of the world. This is much simpler to understand, if you think about it. But I capped out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 a month. People were going, literally they were going bankrupt over insulin, or they weren’t getting the insulin, which is a terrible thing. It’s $35 a month or less for seniors in many Medicare drug plans, saving them an average of nearly $450. I mean that’s a tremendous saving. Many cases much less than 35. Seema, in many cases much less than the 35. Right? Did you say $1 in some cases? What’s your lowest number? Come on, Seema. Let’s hear it. Huh? She doesn’t want to give too much. I think maybe $1 is too much. Okay. She’s very straight. She’s a straight player. You brought it down from what number? The 35 down from what Seema?
Tremendously. Yeah. It’s a great job. You did that. But she would come up to me for a year and a half talking about the insulin. The insulin is the biggest, it’s such a problem for people where they’d go without it. They had no choice because it was too expensive. Great job both of you. Thank you very much.

I also announced that more than 35 million Medicare beneficiaries will soon receive a card in the mail with $200 that you can use to help pay for prescription drugs. But I was going to tell you, I’ve allowed Ron DeSantis now to go to Canada and buy your prescription drugs. Now, why am I doing that? Because before all of the favored nations and everythings kick in, which ultimately I think that’s what you’re going to be using more than anything. But Canada gets their drugs for about 50% of what we get them for. Same drug, same exact pill, company, everything, Johnson & Johnson, whatever the company, Ron is going to buy from Canada, and he’s just cut your price in half. Right? Right? When are you starting that Ron? When do you think you’ll start?
Very soon. So Alex get him approved up. Okay? Whatever you have to do. I think it’s great. Some people say, “Well that doesn’t …” My attitude is, whatever the hell it takes. We have this terrible system that’s taken years and years to rig. Like the ballots. Right? Like the ballots. It’s taken them years and years to rig. So they’re very simple. Go buy from Canada. We get rid of the middleman. We get rid of all of this nonsense. You like that mayor? You like that mayor? Both of you? Pretty great Ron. Do it fast Ron. Do it fast. To care for, I mean you’re not going to believe what’s going to be happening with your numbers. I mean they’re coming down big.

We’re not talking about 1%. I mean I don’t even want to mention it, but last year out of 51 years, this is the first time the prescription drug prices have come down in 51 years. They didn’t come down much. They came down like 1%, which I don’t want to mention in one way. But in another way, it tells you something. First time in 51 years when drug prices come down. But now you’re talking about a 50, 60, 70, and 80% reduction in your prescription drug prices. We got to get it all finished up. Wouldn’t it be terrible if Sleepy Joe took this over, the system that I’ve created? And you people will say, “Man, has he been a great president. Look at what he’s done.”

As an example, transparency starts on January 1st. I said to my people, “You couldn’t start it like in August, back? They said, “Sir, you have to go statutorily here, here, here.” I say, “Yeah, but I’d better win this damn election because, can you imagine, mayor, he’ll be saying, “Boy, I’m getting a lot of credit. What the hell did Trump do? This is unbelievable.” I promise you, they won’t give the credit to us. Will, they, huh? No, but I think we’re not going to have to worry about it. I hope that … get out and vote, vote, vote. To care for our nation’s veterans, I signed into law VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought that would be possible. Right? Nobody thought that would be possible.

We’ve also invested billions and billions of dollars in research and innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, kidney disease, sickle cell disease, AIDS, cancer, and many other illnesses. I will say this, AIDS will be eradicated in this country now in six years. I started right at the beginning. President Obama should have started, he could have started it two years before, or two and a half years before. They wasted two years. But we started it right at the beginning of the administration, and it was a ten-year program. We’re down to six years. In six years it will be essentially eradicated in our country. Think of that. Who would have thought that? It’s an amazing thing. It should have been started before I got into office. It could have been.

Day after day I’m fighting to defend our seniors from the virus, from Big Pharma, oh they love me, special interests, and from the radical socialist left. American seniors, remind us that we’ve inherited an incredible, extraordinary legacy. You’re the generation that defeated Fascism and triumphed over Communism, sent American astronauts to the moon. You built our country into the greatest and most powerful nation the world has ever known. Frankly, right now it’s more powerful than it ever was. When I took over, we had a depleted military. We have now a military … we have the greatest weapons on Earth. We are the envy of the world.

We have the greatest weapons, the missiles, rockets, tanks, the tankers, the freighters, the boats, the ships, the jet fighters, F-35s, the F-18s, F-16s. Nobody has the equipment that we have in the world. Not even close. Even the hypersonic missiles. You know? Under the Obama Administration, they stole our plans for hypersonic. That’s the super-duper, I call them the super-duper missiles. The ones that go so fast, you can’t even see them, and now we have that. You probably read about it last night. We have the fastest by far in the world.

Now we’re doing a great job, and our seniors and generations of Americans before you, they did not pour out their heart, and soul, and blood, and tears, for this country only now to surrender our freedom, our flag, and our American way of life. You seniors have protected us, and now I as a senior and all of my people, we are protecting you. Your courage, your leadership, your patriotism, and your faith, are an inspiration to us all. With your help we will transcend every obstacle, defeat every threat, and triumph over every single challenge. We will lift our nation to new heights of greatness and glory, and America will emerge stronger, more united, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. For our nation, for our great seniors, and for our beloved children and grandchildren, the best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.",16/10/2020
