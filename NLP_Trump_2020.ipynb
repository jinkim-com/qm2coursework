Get those people over here. See me. Let them come over. What is a big crowd, it\\u2019s always big. We want to win. We got to win. We want to save our country from the radical left, the radical left crazies. Thank you very much. And hello, North Carolina, hello, North Carolina. We love you, North Carolina. I\\u2019m thrilled to be in Fayetteville with thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots. And you know what\\u2019s going to happen in 45 days from now, and you\\u2019re watching those polls. They go up, up, up up.45 days from now, we\\u2019re going to win North Carolina. We\\u2019re going to win four more years in the White House. As we meet tonight, our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her landmark rulings, fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all Americans. You may agree. You may not disagree with her, but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people. I say, all Americans Justice Ginsburg\\u2019s close relationship with a friend of ours, a friend of mine, Justice Scalia, is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency, dignity, and respect. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. Thank you very much.So Article II of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the Supreme Court. I don\\u2019t think it can be any more clear, can it? I don\\u2019t think so. I don\\u2019t think so. What do you think, Thom? Thom Tillis, I don\\u2019t think it can be any more clear.This can only happen in North Carolina.I hope you hear that back home. Look at all that press. That\\u2019s a lot of press. That\\u2019s a lot of fake news. Well, I hope they hear. So the chant, this is a new one. Fill that seat. This is the chant. This can only happen to me. Fill that seat. Now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat, right? And that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re going to do. We\\u2019re going to fill the seat.I love that chant. We hear more chants, there\\u2019s a lot of genius in those chants half the time. You said it better than you can say it. You can read a speech. But what\\u2019s better than those words, fill that seat. You know what you do? You come up, you say, \\u201cFill that seat,\\u201d you leave and you\\u2019ve said everything. You don\\u2019t have to. There have been 29 times the vacancy opened during an election year or prior to an inauguration. 29 times, that\\u2019s a lot. Every single time the sitting president made a nomination. That included, did you ever hear of George Washington? Did you ever hear of Thomas Jefferson? Or how about the great Abraham Lincoln when he wore the hat [ 00:20:13]. With a great hat. I want to try one of those hats. I love that.No, think of it. 29 times, every single time nobody said, \\u201cOh, let\\u2019s not fill the seat.\\u201d We won the election. Now then we have some senators that, forget it. Think of it, I won\\u2019t say it. I won\\u2019t say it, Susan. I won\\u2019t say it, Susan. But Thom Tillis is with us. I can tell you that. Great. We have great Republican senators. We have great people and we have a great country. That\\u2019s really, we have a great country. And we\\u2019re going to keep it that way. So we win an election and those are the consequences. It\\u2019s called fill that seat and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing. The Supreme Court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where, by the way, I didn\\u2019t run.We had a lot of people, a lot of people said, \\u201cOh, he really took a little bit of a shellacking.\\u201d Not nearly as bad as others. In fact, we gained seats in the Senate, but they never talk about that. They don\\u2019t talk about that. We gained two seats. Nobody talked about it. But we didn\\u2019t run. And I had a lot of people that, \\u201cSir, we\\u2019ll never vote in 2018.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, no vote, everybody vote. They just didn\\u2019t. I think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they\\u2019ve waited and you see what\\u2019s going on. You see what\\u2019s happening. You see the enthusiasm that we have. Which, by the way, we set a record in 2016. The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now. Not even close, than we were in 2016.We are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we\\u2019re rounding the turn. We\\u2019re rounding the corner of the pandemic. But we\\u2019re having them outside. And we shouldn\\u2019t say this is some kind of a rally from now on. It\\u2019s called a protest. We are protesters. We\\u2019re going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these, let\\u2019s call them blue states, we want to be nice. We\\u2019re going to call it a protest against stupidity. So we are going to have protests against stupidity.Because a lot of the people like in Michigan and other places, we love Michigan, but the governor\\u2019s got them shut down. I hate to say it, your governor\\u2019s got you shutdown. It doesn\\u2019t look it here. But your governor has got you shut down. I don\\u2019t know, you\\u2019re not breaking a law by being here. Otherwise, if you are, we\\u2019ll have to do something about that because this is a hell of a shutdown. I think your governor has to let this state open up. [ 00:23:21].And Pennsylvania. Look what they\\u2019re doing in Pennsylvania. A great state, that\\u2019s actually something very special is going to happen here, in Pennsylvania. That\\u2019s a commonwealth. We always have to remember Pennsylvania, commonwealth. Got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble. But we love Pennsylvania. And it\\u2019s a shut down. The governor\\u2019s got it just shut down nice and tight. And you know what? On November 4th, it\\u2019s going to be opened up. Because they\\u2019re trying to hurt our numbers. But our economic numbers are so good. They\\u2019re staggering. They\\u2019re the best we\\u2019ve ever had. Jobs, retail, stock, market, everything. And this is with a lot of shutdowns by Democrats. That\\u2019s all they\\u2019re doing. On November 4th, they\\u2019ll announce, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve decided to open up.\\u201dOne of the teachers groups said, actually, one of the unions and one of the politicians in California said, \\u201cNo, we\\u2019re not going to do it. We need to do it. We should be open by November 4th.\\u201d That was not a good thing for them to say. That person I think was fired, I think was fired. In both the 2016 and the 2018 elections, the American people chose a president and a Senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the Constitution as written. Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters. And that is exactly what we\\u2019re going to do. We said that if for any reason, we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy. We\\u2019re not going to say, and by the way, we have plenty of time. There\\u2019s a lot of time. You\\u2019re talking about January 20th.So we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. I won\\u2019t be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. It will be a woman unless, wait, okay, let\\u2019s do a poll. Oh, there they are. How many of these have you come to? Speaking of women, how many of, what is this number one? Like 90, they\\u2019re great. North Carolina, though. I see them all over the place, they\\u2019re great. Anyway, I hope your husbands are okay with it. Are they okay? They\\u2019re okay. You have good husbands. But we\\u2019re going to do a vote. So I said, I love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as I\\u2019m concerned. If we believed in pollsters we wouldn\\u2019t be here right now. But we\\u2019re actually getting very good. We just had a 53 from Rasmussen, which is very good.Considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53. History has shown that when you\\u2019re at 53 you can\\u2019t lose an election. Has anyone ever lost an election with a 53? The answer is yes, when the other side cheats. That could happen, that could happen. That could happen. You saw what happened in Pennsylvania. Some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots. That means I\\u2019ll be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time. Yeah, yeah. We\\u2019ll be leading, we\\u2019ll be winning Pennsylvania. We\\u2019re going to win it easy. We\\u2019re going to win your state easily.I just came off the plane with, by the way, our great chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Did anybody ever hear of Mark [ 00:27:39].And Deb, what a great, she\\u2019s doing such a good job. But Mark, just a few months ago, I\\u2019ve been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know. Really, I mean really great. Does everyone know Madison? Yes? You\\u2019re going to vote for Madison? He\\u2019s great. He\\u2019s a great guy. But Mark had a beautiful head of black hair and I just noticed that hair\\u2019s turning white very fast. But we\\u2019re doing a job. We\\u2019re very close to a great deal with TikTok, TikTok but nobody cares about that anymore. All they care about is fill that seat, right?Until about 24 hours ago, that\\u2019s all they talked about is TikTok, TikTok. We have a deal worked out, I think with Walmart is going to buy it along with Oracle. Larry Ellison, it\\u2019s going to be an incredible combination. And I said, \\u201cDo me a favor. Could you put up $5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country, the real history, not the fake history.\\u201d Because we\\u2019re getting very close to that deal. And all of the technology will be maintained here. They\\u2019re going to move probably to the great state of Texas. Sorry, we got you a lot of business when it came\\u2026 but they\\u2019re going to move into the United States, which is what\\u2019s important. They\\u2019re moving to the United States, unbelievable company. They\\u2019re going to have 25,000 jobs. If it all goes, I gave them the preliminary approval.But they\\u2019re putting up $5 billion. And my only problem is they did it so fast. I should have asked for more. What happened is when I suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said, senators, congressmen, women, everybody. They said, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do that. That\\u2019s never been done.\\u201d That\\u2019s the problem, nothing\\u2019s ever been done. And we had other companies, a lot of people wanted it. And I said, \\u201cYou got to put up $5 million either to the Treasury of the United States maybe or into some education fund or do something.\\u201d And they were sort of agreeing with me. They thought it was okay. And then I went to the legal legals here and I said, \\u201cThey\\u2019re going to put up $5 million, give it to the United States.\\u201d \\u201cSir.,You can\\u2019t do that. There\\u2019s no provision.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHow the hell can there be no provision. We\\u2019re making the deal possible. Why can\\u2019t they give us $5 billion dollars?\\u201d That\\u2019s b, that\\u2019s a lot of money.Now, watch the crazy Democrats. They\\u2019ll go, \\u201cThey should have gotten more money.\\u201d It\\u2019s never been done before. They should have, no matter what you do. They should have gotten more. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy. But I\\u2019ll tell you. And I said it last night, we had a great rally. Last night, you saw that in a place that we\\u2019re going to win. We\\u2019re going to win Minnesota. Hasn\\u2019t been won since 1972. And they\\u2019re all saying, \\u201cWell, we did give them back the big iron ore range.\\u201d It was, Obama took it away with the stroke of a pen. He put everybody out of work. We gave it back. But I\\u2019ll tell you what, we\\u2019re going to have a victory on November 3rd, the likes of which you\\u2019ve never seen.Now we\\u2019re counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins. Not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later. But in just three and a half years under my administration, we\\u2019ve secured America\\u2019s borders rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S military, think of that. And I shouldn\\u2019t say this and the fake news keeps going, \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s given away classified information.\\u201d No I\\u2019m not. We are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before. And I said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where, \\u201cHe\\u2019s giving away confidential information,\\u201d these people are crazy. No, no. I\\u2019m just telling you that-Crazy. No, no. I\\u2019m just telling you that President Putin and President Xi of China, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody. They are so envious of what we\\u2019re doing. They can\\u2019t even believe it. If they know, they perhaps don\\u2019t know. Under Obama, they knew immediately, okay. Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA. The likes of which no country has ever seen before. And hope to God, we never have to use them. That\\u2019s the key, I don\\u2019t ever want to use them. Remember, I was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week. Remember that? Where\\u2019s the war? We\\u2019re taking them out of Afghanistan. We\\u2019re almost finished with that. Working along well. We\\u2019re taking them out of Syria, other than I left some behind for the oil, we kept the oil, is it okay that we kept the oil? Is it okay we kept the oil? Let\\u2019s go back to my poll. Ready? So we\\u2019re putting, I think it should be a woman, because I actually like women much more than I like men, I have to say.No, I do. I do, I like women more. So I have to make a decision, to fill the seat, as we say, we should have a new campaign. Let\\u2019s make a t-shirt, fill the seat. Okay? My people are so good, tomorrow, it\\u2019ll be all over the place. That\\u2019s a good idea.That\\u2019s a good idea. Fill the seat. Okay watch this, so good tomorrow you\\u2019ll see them all over the place, fill the seat. I don\\u2019t know how the hell they do it, but they get it done fast. You remember I said, where\\u2019s Hunter? Where\\u2019s Hunter? The next day, it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is Hunter? What the hell ever happened? He took the money and he ran I think. Where\\u2019s Hunter? He took the money, he went to China, he took 1.5 billion. He had no experience. He didn\\u2019t have a job until this guy became vice president. Then he went to China, he got $1.5 billion. I asked the head of a great company, Blackstone. One of the biggest in the world. I said, \\u201cSteve, let me ask you a question. Is that possible?\\u201d \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s never done.\\u201d China doesn\\u2019t do that. Well, how did a guy with no experience do this? He said, \\u201cVery simple. His father\\u2019s vice president.\\u201d Is that what you want?And then Ukraine, $183,000 a month, and a $3 million upfront payment for him and his friends, think of this, with no experience and no job, and they said, do you know energy? It\\u2019s an energy company that paid it. Do you know energy? No, I don\\u2019t. I\\u2019ve not familiar with the subject. Our great Congressman. Right? How the hell does this happen? I think it will be brought up into debate. I think it will be brought up in the debate, I think. Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? You know where Hunter is? He\\u2019s probably on the Riviera having a very good time. He\\u2019s giving some great energy advice. He\\u2019s learning. He\\u2019s taking a night class on energy for 180 grand. Where is Hunter? They\\u2019re corrupt. Remember Joe with a prosecutor? $ 1 billion, I\\u2019m not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said, that crazy company over in Ukraine. $1 billion. I\\u2019m not giving it. You get them out. And guess what? They got them out. Here\\u2019s your billion dollars. Now that\\u2019s called quid pro quo. Right? That\\u2019s the real deal.With us, there was none. They made it up. Remember when Shift made the phony speech? Eight times he said the same thing, except that\\u2019s not what happened. Fortunately, we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word, every word. I\\u2019m glad we had them because we\\u2019re dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people. So women and men, ready? Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court or would you rather have a man? Ready? A woman or a man. So, would you rather have me choose, this is a very scientific poll. Actually, it\\u2019s a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed, then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don\\u2019t interview the people. They sit behind their desk. Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court? Yes, woman. Yes?What\\u2019s going on? Let\\u2019s give it one more quick chance. This is a free poll. And this is a lot of people. This is tens of thousands of people. This is a lot of people. You know, the fake news, they\\u2019ll say, \\u201cHe had a smattering of people.\\u201d If Bernie Sanders had a crowd. Oh, he had a massive crowd. It was so big. With me, my crowds are five times bigger than Bernie\\u2019s. And they\\u2019ll say, \\u201cHe had a smattering of people.\\u201d They were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of. Thousands. If those people, come on, bring them over. What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over. Come on over. You got thousands of people behind these people. I would imagine the sight lines aren\\u2019t too good. You have stands in front. Okay. So one more time. Who would rather have a man on the Supreme Court? Who would have a woman on the Supreme. Now tomorrow, like fake news, CNN, he was playing games with the United States. It is a terrible thing he\\u2019s done. No, I\\u2019m just taking a poll, please. And by the way, that\\u2019s a very accurate poll, because that\\u2019s the way I feel. It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman. Who I haven\\u2019t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list. I built this incredible list of brilliant people. And we\\u2019re asking for Biden\\u2019s list. He can\\u2019t give it. You know why? Because if he ever gave a list, he\\u2019d either put somebody in the left middle, which would be okay. You could get votes, or he\\u2019d put one, somebody, which is what he\\u2019s going to choose, so far left, now, if he did the left middle, he loses his entire left coast. Right? And if he loses the left coast, that\\u2019s the end of his election. And last time, remember how many people I got from Bernie, because of trade.A lot of the Bernie people vote for us because Bernie is right about one thing, trade. But Bernie took a bad defeat, didn\\u2019t he? It was a bad loss. He\\u2019s one of the most gracious losers I\\u2019ve ever seen, he is. All Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas had to do is leave. If she left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every one of those States, but they split up that vote. That\\u2019s too bad, but we have Sleepy Joe, we\\u2019ll see how that works out. I think it\\u2019s working out pretty good. We were winning so much, we didn\\u2019t even have, we could have called off the election. We were winning by so much, and then the plane came in from China. And in many ways, I had to go back to work, but I had to go back to work on this one too. And now we\\u2019re going up and up and up and we\\u2019re winning and we\\u2019re winning all over the place. Because I happen to think, I just say what I want. And you know, they make up a lot of false stories. They will make up a lie. Like what I said about military. Can you imagine? No animal would say that. They make it up and then they put it in ads. So once they did that, the only good thing is I can say, I said, \\u201cNow I can say anything.\\u201d He is the worst candidate, the dumbest of all candidates, but he was dumb in prime time, as told to me by a Senator from long ago, he said, \\u201cWho\\u2019s the dumbest in the Senate, who\\u2019s the smartest in the Senate?\\u201d The smartest is, I won\\u2019t tell you. But the dumbest is Joe. I said, \\u201cWho\\u2019s Joe.\\u201d He said, \\u201cJoe Biden.\\u201d That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. If I lose to him, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m going to do. I will never speak to you again. You\\u2019ll never see me again.No, how do you lose? He is honestly, I go up and these guys are grilling me all the time. Stephanopoulos grill, grill. Okay. It\\u2019s all right. It\\u2019s okay. I think it came out very, well it\\u2019s always, it comes out well. You have to be able to answer. They\\u2019re very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries, leaders of foreign countries. But I say he\\u2019s always using a teleprompter. I don\\u2019t care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me? That means the fake news is giving him the questions. So that\\u2019s what really\\u2026 they never gave me the questions. If I ever said, in fact, I\\u2019m going to say it now. I want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me. And I\\u2019m going to read the questions off the teleprompter, and the questions are so easy. Did you see Anderson Cooper? He\\u2019s a nice guy. He\\u2019s interviewed me over the years, a lot, but he\\u2019s a tough interviewer.Did you see those softballs? What do you think Donald Trump is a very bad human being. Do you agree with that? Yes, I do, Anderson. I\\u2019ve never seen softballs, and actually they\\u2019re getting hit by it. They\\u2019re getting hit by it. It\\u2019s just a terrible thing. I mean, this is a guy, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1%. In fact, he actually had 1% with an arrow pointing left. That means less than one. Now he\\u2019s shot, he\\u2019s got half of his head left, and he\\u2019s out, think of it. He\\u2019s totally shot. And he ends up getting the nomination. He couldn\\u2019t get it in prime time. What the hell is going on with the world today? What\\u2019s going on? What\\u2019s going on with the world, Mark Meadows?Unbelievable Meadows, oh boy. He\\u2019s a smart guy, Meadows, great, great guy, North Carolina, in just three and a half years, we obliterated the ISIS caliphate. Remember when I had it down to 99%, they said, \\u201cYou got to finish it.\\u201d I said, \\u201cLet somebody else finish it.\\u201d And we went, and we finished it. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, which we have. China\\u2019s now paying us billions and billions of dollars. But you know, I view it differently now, I view China much differently now, after the plague came in, I view it differently. And we brought your jobs back home to North Carolina and our contract. In three years of President Trump, real median household income rose by almost $7,000. Now think of that, three years, three years, right? Achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. This is in three years. Under 16 years of presidents, Barack Hussein Obama, ladies and gentlemen, is President Barack Hussein Obama, or as Rush Limbaugh, the great, how great is Rush? Do we love Rush? As Rush Limbaugh would say, Barack Hussein Obama.You ever hear Rush? Barack Hussein Obama. Rush is great. He\\u2019s doing well too. He\\u2019s great. He\\u2019s a tough guy. We love Rush. We love you Rush. He watches every one of these rallies. You know, he supported me when I came down with our great first lady, I came down the escalator. I made a speech. I didn\\u2019t even have a speech writer, I had to wing it. The winging speeches are the best ones like last night. But Rush said, \\u201cI like that guy. I\\u2019d never heard that before. I\\u2019d never heard we\\u2019re going to build a wall.\\u201d We\\u2019re going to have secure borders. We\\u2019re going to make new trade deals that are like sane. We\\u2019re going to do all the things we\\u2019re going to rebuild our military. We\\u2019re going to have a strong country again. We did so many things, and Rush heard this. I didn\\u2019t know Rush. I mean, maybe I met him once, twice, for two seconds. And he became an instant fan of Trump. And he was for a long time before I even got to know him. And he\\u2019s been so important, he\\u2019s the King, 39 million listeners. There\\u2019s nobody like him.Try sitting down for what is it? Three hours? And talking, just talking with everyone. 39 million people, often. Try sitting. We love Rush. I love Rush. But listen, try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening, and talk for three hours without phone calls. Phone calls are easy. Hey, what do you think of this? What do you think. Just talk. Talk. And everybody finds it fascinating. And it is fascinating. I wish I had time to listen more often. It\\u2019s a little tough as president, but everybody finds it fascinating. And we gave Rush, because he\\u2019s such an important person and done such an incredible job the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And Catherine, his wife is great. What a couple. But Rush has been unbelievable. He\\u2019s so on our side. And he was from literally day one, right from the beginning.And we don\\u2019t have to mention Sean, and Laura, and so many others. We don\\u2019t have to mention Lou, the great Lou Dobbs, right? I mean, Lou Dobbs said, Lou started years ago, and he liked us from the beginning. He said, \\u201cDonald Trump is going to be a very good president.\\u201d Okay. That was the first little time. Then he went, \\u201cDonald Trump. I love Donald Trump, but he\\u2019s the best since Ronald Reagan.\\u201d Then he went, \\u201cDonald Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\u201d So that was about a year and a half into it. Then the great Lou Dobbs said, \\u201cDonald Trump may be the greatest of all time. Greatest of all time.\\u201d And then somebody said, \\u201cCan I ask you Lou, when you say the greatest, does that include Abraham Lincoln and George Washington?\\u201d He said, \\u201cAbsolutely. He\\u2019s now the greatest of all time.\\u201d So we love Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is great. Go out and buy his book. His book is great. But we have great support. We have great support.Tucker\\u2019s been very good lately, I have to tell you. Tucker has been very good. Tucker Carlson, he\\u2019s come a long way, actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history. He\\u2019s very strong in that, we took care of that very powerfully, very powerfully. We signed an executive order. We fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff, that were getting paid a lot of money that we\\u2019re here for a long time. Under 16 years of presidents Obama and Bush, the median income only rose $2,900. Now think of that. So three years, it went up $7,000, 16 years, it went up less than $3,000. I\\u2019d say that\\u2019s a big difference. And that\\u2019s not including energy, because look what you\\u2019re paying for your gasoline now. Right? Remember those days? Remember those days of $5, you said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s get rid of that big truck.\\u201d Now you\\u2019re all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible. You know why? Because gasoline is so damn cheap, right? Remember the $5 days? Now you\\u2019re below $2 a lot, right? Below two. I mean, they\\u2019re seeing numbers that nobody believes.It\\u2019s all good stuff. And we\\u2019re energy independent. So many things have happened. If you add four or $5,000, so you\\u2019re talking about by $11,000, you got to add the energy. I said to my people, \\u201cPut the energy in.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s right.\\u201d I said, \\u201cDo me a favor, just put it in.\\u201d In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in American history. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we\\u2019re doing it again, and we\\u2019re doing it very rapidly. This is a super V. They said, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t know, V is going to be very hard.\\u201d No, this is a super V. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year. It\\u2019s already in very good shape. Very, very good shape. In a matter of weeks. We will end the pandemic from China. We will end our plague from China. Next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country, it\\u2019s heading that way.If you take a look, automobile manufacturing, housing, retailing, they\\u2019re all setting records, they\\u2019re through the roof, hard to believe, actually, during the rounding the corner, when I say rounding the corner, they go crazy. They want to keep it going as long as possible. If you say anything positive, they say, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not telling the truth to the American public.\\u201d I am actually telling the truth. You know these people, they talked about, because I said, \\u201cWell, Winston Churchill was a great leader.\\u201d They said the other night, \\u201cYou said Winston Churchill was a great leader, but he didn\\u2019t lie.\\u201d Because this guy, Woodward. He writes a book. He\\u2019s had it. He\\u2019s another one shot. I compare him sort of to Biden. He\\u2019s sharper than Biden, I have to say that, but he\\u2019s shot. He\\u2019s tired. He\\u2019s exhausted. I never saw a guy be able to do so much television, try doing a book on somebody else. See how much television time they give you, like none. But they said the other night, and it was amazing. Winston Churchill.They said, \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t lie to the people, to Britain. He didn\\u2019t lie.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWell, let me ask you this. He stood on buildings when the Nazis, Hitler, were bombing London.\\u201d That\\u2019s pretty brave, because he may have been doing a little drinking, but he was known for that, right? He\\u2019s got a right to, but it\\u2019s true. He stood in the buildings in London, as they were bombing London, and made speeches, and made statements, and had everything. And he\\u2019d sometimes have press conferences. And the fake news wouldn\\u2019t show up. He was standing there, nobody was in front of him. But he would stand there, and he would say, \\u201cYou are safe. You are safe. Everything is okay. You are safe.\\u201d Well, that\\u2019s a lie, I guess, right? So I said, \\u201cOh, I never thought of it that way. I guess he lied.\\u201d No, he\\u2019s a great leader, and he was leading, and he was a great, great prime minister. He did a fantastic job. Not lying.No. We love our country, we want to lead our country, and we can\\u2019t let a thing like this, this is a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the world it happened, should have been stopped in China. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, should have been stopped in China. To defeat the China virus, we launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II. Somebody said, \\u201cWhat grade would you give yourself?\\u201d I said, \\u201cA+.\\u201d But I would give myself a D, I would say I would give myself, and my whole group, because Mike Pence is great, Mike Pence really was. He worked so hard. And it\\u2019s unfair, he worked so hard. The ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics now we have, look at what\\u2019s happening. When somebody gets very sick, look how we bring them back so often, compared to what it was originally. I mean, the work that\\u2019s been done, and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with what\\u2019s going on. But the Democrats don\\u2019t want the vaccine. They don\\u2019t want it. At first, they wanted a vaccine, because they didn\\u2019t think it could happen.Now that we have it, they\\u2019re going like, \\u201cWell, we don\\u2019t want it.\\u201d It\\u2019s the craziest thing. Think of it, you want to get a vaccine, and they\\u2019re willing to hurt people, let people die for political reasons. Think of it.I think, honestly, I think it\\u2019s a disgrace. But we surged rapid testing kits. We have more testing than all other, I mean, practically everybody. You look at number two is India. They have 1.5 billion people. We are up 50 million tests more than India. In fact, we\\u2019re about to crack 100 million tests. And when you test, then you have, does this make sense? Then you have cases. So we do all this testing, and I come home and I turn on NBC News. It is so bad.I think NBC, that\\u2019s not only MSDNC. I think NBC with Lester Holt. There\\u2019s another beauty. Hi Lester. How do you feel big in second place Lester? He surged from first place to second place. But NBC News is so, I mean, it\\u2019s just terrible. They use free airwaves, and then they give you fake news. Free airwaves. They should pay a lot of money for this. This is not right. NBC. It\\u2019s owned by a company called Concast, C-O-N, Concast, they\\u2019re con, they\\u2019re con men. It\\u2019s a disgrace. They spend fortunes on public relations and then I get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world, I guess. Yeah, the world, it\\u2019s all over the world. And I say Concast, and immediately, there goes their public, how\\u2019s your public relations doing NBC? Not too good. But they\\u2019re just\\u2026 they don\\u2019t tell the truth. Our country would be so much better off if we had honest media, really. Really would. And do you see what their approval rating has gone to? I think it\\u2019s one of my greatest achievements.Hey look-It\\u2019s a Saturday night. We have all night. This happened last night in Minnesota. I have these teleprompter people, they\\u2019re great, they\\u2019re genius. And I was about 45 minutes into the speech, and I realized I was only on line two. And he was like, \\u201cWhat do I do?\\u201d But we have more fun. Hey, you now have a president that doesn\\u2019t have to use a teleprompter, isn\\u2019t that nice? And I said last night, I said, and yeah, your friends were there. The Congressmen. By the way, is the media now, and I\\u2019m pretty sure it\\u2019s getting close. I think they have a lower approval rating than Congress. Congratulations. No, but it\\u2019s hard. When you\\u2019re sitting there, you\\u2019re in businesses, you\\u2019re in construction, you drive trucks, you do a lot of things. You\\u2019re in offices. You don\\u2019t realize, because you don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s happening. I know exactly a true story. And then it\\u2019s written to totally bend the truth, to make a good thing into a bad thing. Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes.No, but think of it. No but think. And they didn\\u2019t cover the story. Now Obama got his the first week. Very liberal group, and nobody knew what the hell he got it for, and he didn\\u2019t know. Why did you get it? I don\\u2019t know. Remember? I don\\u2019t know. I have no idea. But you know, you have a president, you love your president, and your president gets honored, because I\\u2019m not being honored, you\\u2019re being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, for Israel, what we did with Israel.I went home and I said to the First Lady, \\u201cDarling,\\u201d she\\u2019s very popular. She made a great speech, right? And Ivanka made a great speech, right? But I went home. I said, \\u201cDarling, I have big news tonight. Let\\u2019s turn on the television.\\u201d You know, we don\\u2019t use wind. We use actually, we actually use petroleum. We use Petro. Because we like it to be on like a lot. We don\\u2019t like to have lots of open gaps when the wind\\u2019s not blowing. We can\\u2019t watch President Trump. I go home. I say, \\u201cFirst Lady, a great thing happened today. I was honored, Nobel Peace Prize, nominated. This is a big thing First Lady.\\u201d And then I went home two days later. I said, \\u201cFirst Lady, you\\u2019re not going to believe it. I was honored again. Nobel Prize, that\\u2019s Kosovo.\\u201d Israel, Kosovo. I said, \\u201cFirst Lady, this is great news. Let\\u2019s turn on the television. This is going to be big. This is going to be big tonight. We just got honored, this is big.\\u201d Nobel Peace, can you imagine? You grow up in Brooklyn, Queens, and now you\\u2019re getting the\\u2026\\u201cFirst Lady, let\\u2019s turn on the television. Let\\u2019s turn onto that fake NBC news.\\u201d And I see we have a storm. \\u201cOkay, First Lady, don\\u2019t worry about it. The storm is big. We have it taken care of, FEMA\\u2019s down there, Florida, Alabama, Georgia. We got FEMA down there. It\\u2019s being taken care of. We always take care of it. We take good care of it.\\u201d Texas, Louisiana. We took good care of him two weeks ago. \\u201cAll right First Lady, don\\u2019t worry about it. It\\u2019s the next story, I\\u2019m sure, it\\u2019s the Nobel Prize for peace.\\u201d We\\u2019re stopping mass killings between Kosovo and Serbia. They\\u2019ve been killing each other for so many, they\\u2019re going to stop killing. I said, fellas, let\\u2019s get together. They\\u2019d been doing it for hundreds of years, frankly, under different names. I said, that\\u2019s great. And with Israel, UAE and Bahrain signed a deal with Israel. Everybody said it couldn\\u2019t be done.I said, \\u201cAll right, First Lady, that\\u2019s the first story on NBC, but don\\u2019t worry. That\\u2019s a big story. The floods are big. I see it.\\u201d And then there was a second story about something. And then their third story is about something with me, I don\\u2019t know, something bad they found out. Then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth. I said, \\u201cFirst Lady, I\\u2019m a little embarrassed. I thought we\\u2019d do a little better.\\u201d And then they looked at the screen, and said, \\u201cGood night.\\u201d And I wasn\\u2019t covered. I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination. And they didn\\u2019t cover it. And then the following day I watched a certain show that does like us, and they said, \\u201cWould you believe, that they covered, and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing. That was 18 minutes. And the Peace Prize Nobel version, zero time for President Trump. Thank you very much fake news media, we appreciate it.And when Obama got it, here are the headlines. President Obama gets the Nobel Prize.We need an honest media. The free airwaves, they lie over the free airwaves. They use them and they lie. I don\\u2019t know. We\\u2019re going to have to look at it. They\\u2019re a bunch of scoundrels. They hate it when I say it, but you know, honestly, they are the enemy of the people. When they lie, they are the enemy of the people. You are the enemy of the people. Oh, damn it. The red lights just went off. One, two, three, there\\u2019s one back there, there\\u2019s one back there, probably, oh it\\u2019s OAN, thank you OAN. Every time I get on this subject, they cover me not because they want to, but we get great ratings. We get ratings. These little deals that we have here, come on in folks, come on in. Look at these people.But you know what? I\\u2019ll tell you what, it\\u2019s true. They cover it because\\u2026 But anytime I start talking about the fake news media, you see them getting a little tentative. The camera starts to shake a little bit, and you know, there\\u2019s another thing. Look at this crowd. It\\u2019s as far as the eye can see, it\\u2019s a big crowd, right? They never cover it. I said to my wife last night, we had this incredible crowd. A lot of people, thousands and thousands. I mean like 25, 30,000, many people outside couldn\\u2019t get it. It was like a sea of people. My wife said, \\u201cWas it a large crowd?\\u201d I said, \\u201cDid you watch?\\u201d \\u201cYes. But they only show your face.\\u201d And I saw people they never show. And that includes Fox, which has changed a lot, changed a lot, sad. Somebody said, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the biggest difference between 2016 and now?\\u201d You know what I said, \\u201cFox.\\u201d Biggest difference. Biggest difference. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on with them. But we have some great ones too on Fox.We surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in America. We learned a lot, through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate by 85% since April. Think of that? 85%. We\\u2019ve come up with things. They\\u2019re waiting to see what\\u2019s coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics, which to me is even more important than the vaccine. You go into the hospital, you make people better. You give them a shot, you do a transfusion. You make people better. They walk out, that\\u2019s to me even better, but ultimately long-term, those vaccines are going to be great, and they\\u2019re really working out well and it\\u2019s going to be really soon. The people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible, as long as possible. They\\u2019re going to try and give Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesn\\u2019t even know what a\\u2026It\\u2019s possible. They\\u2019re going to try and get Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesn\\u2019t even know what a vaccine is.Europe is almost 30% higher excess mortality than the United States. Does anyone know that? they don\\u2019t report that, right? Europe? Europe\\u2019s had a hard time. I\\u2019m not looking to hurt them, but they have 30% higher.Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.3 million jobs, and a wonderful place called North Carolina, right?When I banned travel from China in January, Sleepy Joe Biden called it, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hysterical. That\\u2019s xenophobic.\\u201d What does that mean? Tell me what xenophobic means, Sleepy Joe.Who said that? I mean, you\\u2019re my friend. Who said it?All right, what a voice. Have you ever tried opera? What a voice, did everybody hear that?That\\u2019s true. I wouldn\\u2019t say it.She said, \\u201cHe has no idea where he is.\\u201d But I would never say it. I won\\u2019t say it.I won\\u2019t say it. I refuse this.No, but don\\u2019t underestimate him. Look, he\\u2019s been doing this for 47 years, and I got a debate coming up with this guy. No, it\\u2019s true.You never know, you never know. They give him a big fat shot in the ass, and he comes out, and for two hours, he\\u2019s better than ever before. Problem is what happens after the \\u2026 No, we\\u2019re going to ask for a drug test, we are.I\\u2019d like to have a drug test. Both of us. I\\u2019ll take it, he\\u2019ll take. Because I watched him into debates with all those people, those Democrats. The one who treated him worst was Kamala. Actually, also, she was the one that treated, you know that, she was the one that treated him so badly. And she treated Kavanaugh very badly too.Nobody was ever ruder, nobody ever suffered, like Justice Kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people. The way he was tortured was disgraced. And they had nothing.Those women, that was all made up. Most of them have already admitted, it was all made up lies, false accusations, and they made him suffer. And the leader of the pack I would say was, Kamala was the worst, and Pocahontas was a close second.How\\u2019s Pocahontas doing, since she destroyed Bloomberg? How about Bloomberg? Did he get killed?Now he\\u2019s trying to come back. He\\u2019s trying to buy his way back into the Democratic Party. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to put up $100 million in Florida, we\\u2019re going to go,\\u201d he wants to be back so badly. Here\\u2019s a guy who spent $2 billion, it\\u2019s almost two billion now, they\\u2019re finding out. He had some of the dumbest advisers, people I know, some of the dumbest people. If he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads, he could have won. He could have won.Unfortunately, he said, \\u201cNo, I want to debate.\\u201d He went and sued to get into the debates. That was not a good lawsuit. They settled by saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll let you in the debate.\\u201d The first question, he was destroyed.You would think that, the way the Democrats treated him, he would really come to me, and he\\u2019d say, \\u201cI want you,\\u201d but his hatred and jealousy \\u2026 He wanted to be President, but he doesn\\u2019t have the capability of being President.But he\\u2019s going down now to Florida, he\\u2019s going to spend $100 million. How good \\u2026 I have to say this, I\\u2019m not a fan of Elizabeth Warren. I gave her the name Pocahontas, I thought that was the end. Remember what I used to say about her?She has \\u2026 Oh, well, you know it. You know. I would just, look, I said, \\u201cThis is not an Indian.\\u201d She said, \\u201cI\\u2019m an Indian.\\u201d You remember what I said? \\u201cI have more Indian blood than me, I have more in me than she has, and I have none.\\u201dUnfortunately, I\\u2019d like to have some. I would like to have some. I think it could help, it might make me better, but I have none. And I said, \\u201cI have more than she does.\\u201d And then she went out to, and she choked, remember that?She went out, and she took a test. And it found out that about 700 years ago, there was a possible event, 1,024th, right? Wasn\\u2019t that it? Good memory, very good memory. Trump has a good memory.Good moment. Not for that, but for a lot of things.Now, 1024th, which meant many, many, many centuries ago, there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line. But she choked. We forced her into a choke. She went down like a rock, and then she started coming up, up, up, up, up. Then she totally destroyed Mike Bloomberg.We call him Mini Mike. Remember? Mini Mikey wants that platform. \\u201cI want a platform, damn it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t mind. Oh, boy, he was pathetic, but now he\\u2019s going to try and buy his way back into the Democrat party.Who was the other guy, the other rich guy? He just kept spending money. What was his name? [ 01:09:26].You remember that guy? Great environmentalist. Except he made his money with coal, which is okay, I think coal is good. Clean coal, I like clean coal.If we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. You know that. He was way behind. This was months later. And then I watch him last night, reading something saying that, I opened, I closed it up, one week later, one week.Two months later, he was talking about the fact that I shouldn\\u2019t be doing that to China. I shouldn\\u2019t be banning China because I was xenophobic. And it\\u2019s just unbelievable. And now they will say anything. It\\u2019s called disinformation. They will make up a lie, they will make up a story, and they go with it, it makes no difference whether or not it\\u2019s show, and they\\u2019ll take ads. It\\u2019s the worst group of people.He\\u2019s surrounded by bad people, dishonest people, but they\\u2019re very smart. He\\u2019s not smart. They keep him from talking. It\\u2019s actually, if he wins, it\\u2019s the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world.Because they took a man who\\u2019s got nothing. He didn\\u2019t have it, but he\\u2019s got nothing, and I will give them credit. The single greatest campaign in history, if he wins, but you know what? If he wins, North Carolina is screwed, and so is every place else.And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers. I gave the farmers $28 billion. Thank you very much, Presidency. $28 billion. Because you were targeted, right? You were targeted by China. And I said, \\u201cHow much were the farmers,\\u201d Iowa, Nebraska, you, all of them? You were targeted. I said, \\u201cHow much?\\u201d Sonny Perdue, I said, \\u201cHow much, Secretary?\\u201d 12 billion, then 16 billion, you were targeted. I took it out of the tariffs we charge. We never took 25 cents in from China, now we\\u2019re getting billions and billions and billions of dollars.And I took just a small part of it. $28 billion. That\\u2019s a lot of money, but it was a small part of what we\\u2019ve got. They can\\u2019t believe it. So who do you think China would like to see win? [ 01:11:33]Sleepy Joe, that never gave, never took anything, or Trump, misjudging him? So Mexico, we\\u2019re driving them a little crazy. They don\\u2019t like Trump too much. But now Biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine. His campaign campaign\\u2019s really reckless. And all it is is for political reasons. It\\u2019s political reasons.Biden, his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown. We\\u2019re getting better, we\\u2019re really coming along, and he\\u2019s talking about shutting down. We\\u2019re not doing any shutdowns. We don\\u2019t need shutdowns. Maybe a little area, if it\\u2019s such a spike, we understand, we have to take care of our senior citizens.This guy talked, he said, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll do whatever my medical people want. I believe in science.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t know what science is. \\u201cI believe in science.\\u201d No, we\\u2019re not doing any shutdowns. We don\\u2019t need, we\\u2019re rounding the turn. Without the vaccine, we\\u2019re rounding the turn. With the vaccine, it\\u2019ll just speed it up.That\\u2019s another one that will be controversial. They\\u2019ll say, \\u201cHe\\u2019s saying that it\\u2019s happened.\\u201d Yeah, without the care, without the vaccine, it\\u2019s going along. With a vaccine, even better. It\\u2019ll be faster.Biden\\u2019s own chief of staff said, when they manage the H1N1 that he calls the N1H1, right? He goes, \\u201cthe N1H1,\\u201d and that\\u2019s an easy one, because H comes before, but he always gets it wrong.It\\u2019s like, seven times, \\u201cIt\\u2019s great to be with the great people of Iowa.\\u201d They\\u2019ll say, \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re in Idaho.\\u201d \\u201cOh.\\u201d I\\u2019ve never made that mistake so far. But I always say, \\u201cIf you do, just leave the stage, because you can never recover.\\u201dYou can speak as well as, I mentioned, Winston Churchill, even though he was a great speaker, he was a stutterer, and he became one of the greatest speakers ever. You could be Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake, just leave the stage. You can\\u2019t recover.But he\\u2019s made it oftentimes, right, in New Hampshire, and it was Vermont. The worst, I think, I think there was one, he was in Ohio, and he said he was in Florida, right? But he couldn\\u2019t find any palm trees.We just got a poll from Ohio. Through the roof. Great state of Ohio, good Governor, great state of Ohio. But when they managed the H1N1 swine flu, this was from his top person that ran it. \\u201cWe did every possible thing wrong. 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it was just a total disaster.\\u201d He basically said, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know what the hell we were doing.\\u201d And this is the guy that\\u2019s going to tell us what to do with something that\\u2019s much more lethal, much more lethal. This is much more lethal than the swine flu.If H1N1 had the same fatality rate as the China virus, over two million people would have already perished. They didn\\u2019t know what the hell they were doing. And the guy admitted it. That guy can not be very popular in Democrat politics right there.But just to remember, and he\\u2019s telling us how to do things. We\\u2019re building ventilators, we\\u2019re the ventilator capital of the world now, think of it. We\\u2019re sending them to other countries, we have so many.And we have made a lot of Governors look very good. And they all admit it, until the press comes in front, where they say, \\u201cOh, he was okay,\\u201d but we took care of them. We took care of Governors, we took care of the states.On November 3rd, North Carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns. These are all things that he said.Shut down our economy, destroy the suburbs. They were saying that women in the suburbs, they\\u2019re not sure if they like me. They\\u2019re starting to like me a lot lately, because it\\u2019s law and order. They want law and order. Thank you. A suburbanite, thank you, thank you.No, it\\u2019s true. I don\\u2019t know. But I heard the same thing four years ago, remember? \\u201d Women will not vote for him.\\u201d Then we win the election, it\\u2019s like, they\\u2019re all in shock. Well, what took place? \\u201cWell, he did very well with women,\\u201d what the hell was that all about, right? Did very well. Women were great.Hey, we were way above everything. African American, we did great, Hispanic, we did great. Have you seen African American and Hispanic American numbers? If it holds true, we will have set a record for a Republican, which is [ 00:12:29].Now, if it holds true \\u2026 There a lot of jobs, a lot of jobs, a lot of great thinking, but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens. Now, what that\\u2019s going to do is destroy our country, because two things happen. Number one, we can\\u2019t afford it. Number two, everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that.Right now, they\\u2019re saying, wherever they are, when you say, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to give you free education, we\\u2019re going to give you free healthcare. We\\u2019re going to take care of you. Everything\\u2019s going to be perfect. We\\u2019re going to give you, every single family,\\u201d now watch, they\\u2019ll print this. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve checked it out, and he lied about this.\\u201dEvery single family is going to be given a brand new Silver Cloud Rolls Royce. Now, I said that, and CNN went, \\u201cHe lied about the fact that they\\u2019re not getting a Rolls Royce.\\u201dRemember what I said? \\u201d Russia, if you\\u2019re listening,\\u201d in front of this message, \\u201cRussia, if you\\u2019re listening, find out where her e-mails,\\u201d or whatever. And then, everybody laughed, I laughed.Well, they actually play it all the time. \\u201cWhen he spoke to Russia.\\u201d Do you ever see it? And they cut it off before the end, they don\\u2019t see any, I said, \\u201cRussia, if you\\u2019re listening \\u2026\\u201d Oh, these people are sick.He wants to erase your borders. Yeah, that was supposed to be a joke, right? It was a joke. It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second. He wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in education. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I am launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called, 1776 Commission. It\\u2019s already done.And it\\u2019s true, your kids come home, and they tell you things. How many of you, the kids come home, and they tell you things. It\\u2019s a disgrace, what they\\u2019re teaching them, it\\u2019s a disgrace. We\\u2019re ending it. In fact, we\\u2019re taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things, bad things, actually.We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. And we are getting better every single day. And no party can lead America, that will not teach our children to love America. No party can do that.The sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down America and our way of life. We have a great way of life, and getting better all the time. Look at what we\\u2019ve done.Biden\\u2019s running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail, including one who attempted murder. That\\u2019s right. One who attempted to murder a police officer, and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, 13 members of Biden\\u2019s staff donated to the same fund. Look, that\\u2019s where they\\u2019re coming from, just so you know.He\\u2019s trying to go a little bit more right, like the fracking. \\u201cOh, well of course, we\\u2019re going to have \\u2026\\u201d For six months, he\\u2019s saying, there\\u2019ll be no fracking, which I don\\u2019t think the people in Pennsylvania thrilled with, do you agree, considering that your taxes could quadruple.I tell it all the time, Texas, right? Texas, they like oil. They like guns, right, in Texas. Right? And they like God. So he comes out with a platform, no oil. We don\\u2019t want oil. This is during the Democrat deal.There\\u2019ll be no oil, there\\u2019ll be no God, there\\u2019ll be no guns. This is not a good campaign. And then the fake news says, \\u201cDonald Trump is tied in Texas.\\u201d I\\u2019m tied. Last time I was tied in Texas until the day of the vote. Then they announced, the second they called it, \\u201cThe polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.\\u201dThink of it. He\\u2019s against oil. He\\u2019s against guns. They\\u2019re going to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment\\u2019s going to be destroyed. I am holding up your Second Amendment. If it\\u2019s not me, look what I\\u2019ve done. You think it\\u2019s been easy?They want to get rid of the Second Amendment. They\\u2019re going to get rid of the guns, right? And religion. So, look what they\\u2019re doing to religion. These states, everything\\u2019s closed, except, you\\u2019re allowed to protest. That\\u2019s why I say everything we do is a protest.Look at all those people back there, look at that. Look it, they just form. Wow. Turn the cameras around, please. They never do it. Turn the cameras around, please.Wow. Thank you. That\\u2019s a lot of people. We\\u2019re proud of you. That\\u2019s a lot of people. You ever notice, they never do it, though.I say, \\u201cTurn the camera.\\u201d Right from the beginning, they never did. They don\\u2019t want to give us the credit for these big crowds, because you know what?When you see crowds like this, or in Wisconsin, that I had a few nights ago, or last night was so incredible. What we had last night was just incredible, in Minnesota. We\\u2019re going to win it, 1972, we\\u2019re going to win it. 1972, it hasn\\u2019t \\u2026 That\\u2019s a long time ago. Remember?I think Reagan won every state except for Minnesota. We\\u2019re going to win Minnesota. What we\\u2019ve done for them, we\\u2019ve opened up their livelihood again. Maine. How about Maine? I opened up 5,000 square miles of ocean. Obama closed it. They said, \\u201cWhy? He had no idea.\\u201d Right off their shore, no fishing, no nothing. They called it a monument, right? Right off their shore.Maine, I mean, if I don\\u2019t win Maine \\u2026 Maine traditionally is not really very Republican, but I won Maine too last time, actually. Because I love Maine, too. I love Maine, too. But think of what I did.I opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women. Now they go lobster fishing and fishing. But 5, 000, I said, \\u201cWhy did they close it?\\u201d Nobody was able to tell me, but I opened it up, an executive order. I totally opened it up.I did many other things. Then I got the tariffs. They couldn\\u2019t do business in European Union, they couldn\\u2019t do business in China, because they were charging tariffs to Maine. So Canada would take our fish and lobster. We\\u2019d sell it to Canada for nothing, and they\\u2019d sell it to China and Europe, because they didn\\u2019t have to pay tariffs.Not only did I get the 5,000 \\u2026 Think of what, 5,000 square miles. So you take one mile, square mile, multiply times 5,000. That\\u2019s a big area, even in an ocean, right? It\\u2019s massive. And it was the best area, the best. I got rid of the tariffs.I told them, \\u201cIf you tariff our Maine lobster people, and fishermen and women, if you want a tariff on them, that\\u2019s okay, but we\\u2019re going to tariff your cars, okay?\\u201d Which is a much bigger deal. It was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off.I did that off of Maine, I did that in two weeks, okay? Took me two weeks. Once I found out about it, it\\u2019s hard to believe it ever happened. So I did that for Maine. And somebody said, I\\u2019m down in Maine. How the hell can I be down in Maine, after what I did?I\\u2019ll tell you what if I do that from Maine, and if Maine doesn\\u2019t vote for Trump. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m going back, okay? I can tell you one thing. Their Senator never did it for them.Joe Biden and the Democrats want to gut police departments nationwide. You know that, right? Here in North Carolina, nearly 50 Democrat State House members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding, endangering your families.I was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state, and we\\u2019re joined by many of them tonight. Where are they? Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you, folks. Thank you. Thank you.You got to take care of our law enforcement. We got to take care, nobody can do the job like them. We have to let them do their job. We\\u2019ve got to stop this nonsense, this child\\u2019s play, we\\u2019ve got to stop, they\\u2019re great.You know, I was endorsed by, think of this, New York\\u2019s finest. It\\u2019s very tough. You know, de Blasio\\u2019s your mayor, he doesn\\u2019t have a clue what\\u2019s happening, either. I think Sleepy Joe\\u2019s worse, do you want to know the truth? Because this other guy has just an ideology that\\u2019s just terrible.But de Blasio is there, and New York\\u2019s finest, first time they\\u2019ve ever endorsed a Presidential candidate, they endorsed me, three weeks ago. That takes courage. Think of it. Chicago, the police in Chicago, they could do their job. We don\\u2019t even have to bring in the National Guard. Whenever we do, it takes about 30 minutes, it\\u2019s over, right? Like we did in Minneapolis, 30 minutes.Remember that beautiful scene? They lined up, they went down, there was no social distancing in between these great, tough guys. There was no social distancing, Tom Tillis. They went down and they had $250,000 outfits. They had more crap on that helmet with night goggles. And these guys were sort of wise guys, right? They were shouting at them, screaming at them. They were screaming at the wrong people. They went down, they never had to stop. It was just forward.It all ended. It all ended in Minneapolis. It took, you also had, what? A half an hour? Remember, they hit the CNN reporter in the knee? He went down, Ali Velshi. He said, \\u201cThis is a friendly protest. It\\u2019s wonderful to see such a \\u2026\\u201dBehind him, it was all fire for a block. It looked like Berlin during the war. \\u201cThis is a friendly \\u2026\\u201d What are they doing? How does that help to be like that? How does that help?We\\u2019re joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me. One man who, especially over the last year, he has been so great, he couldn\\u2019t be better.And I think he\\u2019s doing very well. I\\u2019m looking at some numbers, and you\\u2019re doing very well. And I think your opponent has some very big problems. Senator Tom Tillis. Thank you, Tom. Thank you.He\\u2019s been great, smart guy. And he\\u2019s got a couple of bills that he\\u2019s putting in, one in particular, I love it. You got to do it. That if a sanctuary city causes problems, you can sue the sanctuary city, you can sue.Will you get, we got to get that one moving, right? That\\u2019s moving along, right? That\\u2019s a great one.A man who, I just did a phone call for the other night, and the people love him. He\\u2019s in a rough district, but he\\u2019s now leading. I see you\\u2019re up in the polls, Congressman Richard Hudson, great guy.Where\\u2019s Richard? Great guy. He\\u2019s a warrior.And two people I really liked, because we fought like hell for them a year ago, right? And they had guts, and they had what it takes. They didn\\u2019t choke. You know, a lot of people choke. They choke, they gag, they can\\u2019t breathe. Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop, they didn\\u2019t choke, they\\u2019re fantastic. They are fantastic people. Thank you. Look, they\\u2019re friends. We\\u2019re friends. Those two guys were incredible. Thank you very much, great job. Really great job. And a man that should be your Governor, I don\\u2019t know, he\\u2019s doing well, but Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, everybody. Thank you very much, great job. Handsome guy, handsome. Looks like Cary Grant. I hear you\\u2019re doing really well.Look, I mean, this guy\\u2019s got this state totally closed down. It\\u2019s ridiculous. It\\u2019s, when are they going to open? When are they going to open? Dan, this would have been opened up a long time ago. And you would have done even better. I mean, you would have done better.And North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley. Michael? Thank you, Michael. Great job, Michael. How are we doing, Michael? How\\u2019s it going? Are we up? I mean, if I lose North Carolina, I\\u2019m getting out of here. This is not \\u2026 Look at that. This is not, just so you know, the crowd of a man that\\u2019s coming in second.I say it all the time. I said it when I left Michigan. 2016, the night of the election, we had 32,000 people. Hillary was there, just before me, in a prime location.She had about 400 people. I got there at 12 in the evening, I started speaking at one in the morning, it\\u2019s now Election Day, and I left. 32,000 people, we had 32,000 people.So it\\u2019s now Election Day. I start speaking, I started speaking, think of it, one o\\u2019clock in the morning, we had 30, you never saw anything like it. I left. I said, \\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t look like we\\u2019re going to lose Michigan.\\u201dAnd guess what? We didn\\u2019t. We won Michigan, first time in decades. And you know what we\\u2019ve done? Many, many car plants are now opening up.A great gentleman, who\\u2019s just retiring, Prime Minister Abe, of Japan. I said, \\u201cShinzo, please do me a favor. We need more car companies. You\\u2019re selling cars into our country, please. We want to build here, not in Japan, please.\\u201dHe said, \\u201cBut we cannot do that. This is a free enterprise system.\\u201d I said, \\u201cI know, Shinzo, please. I need some car companies. Please do it.\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t do it.\\u201d I said, \\u201cShinzo, you have to do it.\\u201dNext day, it was a story, \\u201cFive car companies to open up in Michigan,\\u201d right? So much for free enterprise, but he\\u2019s a great guy, he\\u2019s a friend of mine. He\\u2019s great. They\\u2019re lucky he\\u2019s a friend of mine. I would have been much tougher.It\\u2019s hard. When a guy is a friend, it\\u2019s hard, but they did a lot. They did a lot. They helped it a lot. And what they\\u2019ve done here, by the way, Japan, and what they\\u2019ve done in Michigan, Ohio, what they\\u2019ve done?By the way, we all love South Carolina, right, right? I think we love it. Now, South Carolina, we\\u2019re winning here, but South Carolina, I hate to say this to you, I don\\u2019t want to make you upset. We\\u2019re winning by about 400 points.I spoke to a great person in South Carolina who said, \\u201cSir, you don\\u2019t have to come here. This thing\\u2019s up by a lot.\\u201d What the hell is the difference, right?I mean, we are up, and we\\u2019re up good, but I\\u2019d love you to tie South Carolina. What do we have to do? But a lot of activity in South Carolina also, they\\u2019re doing great.You had the best year you\\u2019ve ever had. They\\u2019ve had the best year they ever had. And you\\u2019re going to go to a better year, we are going to have a better year.We\\u2019re also deeply honored to be joined by a military spouse, Amy Williams, who was reunited with her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, at my State of the Union address. Everybody remembers that. Everybody remembers.Look at that. Hi, Amy. What a great friendship. We had a great State of the Union, right? Good, you\\u2019re looking well. Thank you very much. Say hello to the whole family. Thank you.Thanks to the incredible sacrifices of our warriors, and they are warriors. We\\u2019re pursuing peace in Afghanistan, it\\u2019s very close. We\\u2019re down to, we will soon be down to 4,000 soldiers. We\\u2019re taking them out.They\\u2019re serving as policemen. They\\u2019re serving as police, and they\\u2019ve done a great job. We could win everything, but I\\u2019m not looking to kill three million people to win, what? To win what?We should have never been in the Middle East, and we\\u2019re bringing them back. We\\u2019re bringing them back, just so you know, we\\u2019re bringing them back from Iraq. We\\u2019re down to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq.And in Syria, we\\u2019re all back, we\\u2019re all finished, except for one thing. If it\\u2019s okay with you. I decided to keep the oil. We took the oil, we kept it.And we\\u2019ll always support America\\u2019s incredible military families. So thank you very much. Thank you, darling. Really good. Okay.In everything we do, we\\u2019re putting America first, unlike other administrations, and not just Obama and Biden. This has gone on for many years. We put America first, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.And you know what? Other countries, for the first time in decades, respect us again. Remember that. They respect us again. You know all about data, 28 countries. We had six countries that were current, and the amount of current is too low, okay? Six countries. I went in, and I said, \\u201cYou got to pay. Sorry, you\\u2019re delinquent.\\u201dThey said, \\u201cReally?\\u201d \\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re delinquent. You got to pay.\\u201d Obama would go, and make a speech and leave, that would be it. We were paying for it.We\\u2019re protecting Europe, and they\\u2019re screwing us on trade. So we protect them, and they\\u2019re screwing us on trade. No good, no good. Can\\u2019t do it. I said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s unfair.\\u201d And the Secretary General, Stoltenberg, of NATO, said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen,\\u201d and the fake news can call him up and check. He said, \\u201cHe\\u2019s the greatest that we\\u2019ve ever seen.\\u201d For 20 years, the spending at NATO went like this, right? And America, we pick it up. Every time it goes down, they didn\\u2019t pay.And I said, \\u201cWe\\u2019re supposed to protect you. You\\u2019re going to be attacked by Russia or somebody, we\\u2019re supposed to protect you. And yet you\\u2019re delinquent. You don\\u2019t pay your bills.\\u201d And that includes Germany.They\\u2019re paying 1%, they\\u2019re supposed to pay two, and 2% is way too low. 2% military spending.So we got, listen to this. It never gets reported by these fakers. We got $130 million more, more, not total, more, going to, over three years, $400 billion.So we\\u2019re going from 130 billion, with a B, not million, to $400 billion. And they said to me, they said \\u2026And they said to me, they said to me, very nice guy, head of one of the countries, at a table. I can\\u2019t believe it never got released, but now we can talk about it, because it\\u2019s three years ago. But they said, \\u201cSir \\u2026 \\u201d And this was a big private meeting of all of the nations, \\u201cDoes that mean if we don\\u2019t \\u2026 \\u201d Because I said, \\u201cYou got to pay your bills. We\\u2019re protecting you. You\\u2019re not paying your bills.\\u201d Some did, like Poland and some others, but most didn\\u2019t. Six to eight were current, and we were paying much more than we should have been paying, much more.I mean, it\\u2019s Europe. We got to defend ourself, and there was no guarantee that they\\u2019d help us if we ever had a problem. Right? We\\u2019re never going to have a problem. We got so much stuff now. We were depleted. Now we have great \\u2026 But they said to me, \\u201cDoes this mean \\u2026 \\u201d And I had to give this answer. I can\\u2019t believe it didn\\u2019t get leaked by some sleazebag. We have leakers all over this place, but a lot of it didn\\u2019t leak. A lot of it is just made up by the newspapers. They make up phony stories.They say, \\u201cDonald Trump woke up today. He was in a very bad mood, according to sources.\\u201d There is no source. They just made it up. Hey, I woke up, and I was in a bad mood. True. I\\u2019ve actually had a \\u2026 I\\u2019ve been in a good mood, because we\\u2019re doing so much for our country. We\\u2019ve done so much for our country.But at the NATO meeting, one of the presidents of one of the good countries, all good, they said, \\u201cSir, does this mean that if we don\\u2019t pay, does this mean that you\\u2019re going to leave, and you\\u2019re not going to protect us?\\u201dI said, \\u201cYes. That\\u2019s what it means. I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d It was an amazing effect, because other presidents said, \\u201cNo. We will always protect you. We will always protect you, even if you don\\u2019t pay, even if our taxpayer is paying for everything, even though you take advantage of us on trade, you don\\u2019t let our cars in, you don\\u2019t let our stuff in, but you sell us like crazy, even though you tariff our product, even though you do everything, and then you take advantage of us with the military.\\u201d They said, \\u201cWe will always protect you.\\u201dSo they didn\\u2019t pay. Why the hell would they pay? They said, \\u201cBoy, these guys are stupid.\\u201d So they asked me the question, \\u201cDoes this mean, sir, that you will not protect us anymore if we don\\u2019t pay?\\u201d I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to say, it does.\\u201d That\\u2019s a big story. Three years ago, it\\u2019s a big story. It was amazing how the money came in. So we took in 130 billion a year, going over a three-year period, to 400, just because I asked. Right? Just because I asked. True.They don\\u2019t report that story. Then we got lightweights that I fired, and they write books about me, that I\\u2019m a bad guy, \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s a terrible guy. He treats our allies so badly.\\u201d No. Our allies treat us badly. Our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies. I must be honest with you. They take advantage of us. Everyone takes advantage of your country, and we don\\u2019t put up with it. And you know what the funny thing? We get along better now, because they respect us again. Before, they thought we were stupid. They respect us again. They do.I mean, look at Israel, look what we did. I saw Kerry this other day. Is this guy the worst negotiator? Gave Iran 150 billion, plus 1.8 billion in cash. He never walked. Sometimes in a negotiation, when you\\u2019ve given everything, and you can\\u2019t give anymore, and then they want more, you get up ane walk. Remember the bicycle accident? That was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race. 73 years old. \\u201cI promise,\\u201d I said, \\u201cI will never ever \\u2026 I promise to you, ride a bicycle in a race, or any other time frankly.\\u201dI will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation. And he broke his leg, and his arm, and he was all screwed up. And that was actually a good thing, because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal, which I terminated. Nah, we had some terrible negotiators, and they all said, I saw them the other day, this was him like a year ago, \\u201cMark my words, you will never ever sign deals with Arab countries, with Israel. It can\\u2019t be done.\\u201dWell, we just signed the two great ones, and we got about seven more that want to come in. What a bunch, what a bunch. And then they say bad things about your president. They don\\u2019t like my foreign policy. I like my foreign policy. You like it. No, we were taken advantage of by the whole world. They\\u2019re so stupid, so stupid. We\\u2019ve spent the last four years reversing the damage that Biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period.Joe Biden is weak. He\\u2019s supported every globalist sellout of North Carolina, the workers, what he\\u2019s done. And when I say, \\u201chim\\u201d, it\\u2019s him and people in his little group that \\u2026 You\\u2019ve achieved so much over a period of time. He sold it out. Look at NAFTA. How bad was NAFTA? China\\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. TPP would have destroyed our car industry. And of course, he joined and wanted to join the Paris Climate Accord. That\\u2019s another beauty. That would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars. That was actually, I think, designed to put us out of business, literally.Biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to China and other countries. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. You know that. You lost 43%, but I think the real number is 61%, by the way. Biden says that this an election between Scranton and Park Avenue. By the way, he left Scranton. He likes to say, \\u201cI was born in Pennsylvania.\\u201d But he doesn\\u2019t say he left. His father left. Not his fault, but they make it like he\\u2019s \\u2026 No, he went to Delaware. He doesn\\u2019t leave Delaware, that I can tell you. Every time I see this guy \\u2026 Wilmington, Delaware. Does he ever leave?I\\u2019m in Los Angeles. I\\u2019m trying to work on the fires. They ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe. Ridiculous. The floors of the forest, it\\u2019s got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone, matchsticks. Forest management. Naturally, this is an election, not between Scranton or wherever it is. It\\u2019s really between Scranton and China, you know that, Scranton and China.I\\u2019m with America. Biden is with China. If Biden wins, China wins. If we win, America wins, North Carolina wins, Pennsylvania wins, and the American workers win in every single state. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from this horrible, horrible deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when I ended the NAFTA nightmare. You got hit so hard. All those empty buildings all over the place, but a lot of them now are filled up because of us. They filled up. When did they fill up? Over the last three-and-a-half years. I proudly signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law, which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the United States, and it\\u2019s already doing.We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared by more than $1 billion a year. Congratulations, good job. We launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces. This by itself would be a big achievement. This is one of so many different things, Right to Try, the military, the vets, everything. We\\u2019ve done so much, but we \\u2026 75 years, right? Last one was the Air Force. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, they\\u2019re so good. We have another one now, for 75 years, Space Force. We need it. I never even promised that. Right?One of them said recently that, \\u201cHe\\u2019s actually done more than he promised in the campaign.\\u201d That means I\\u2019m probably the only politician in history. They will tell you, these incredible women up here from North Carolina. Stand up. Will you, please? These are most incredible people. Thank you. Stand up. Turn around for the cameras, so they can see how incredible you are. Thank you.Man, oh, man. What a life. But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice. You saw that. What Obama was nothing. It wasn\\u2019t working, the MISSION Act. That\\u2019s amazing. And accountability, where we can fire people in the VA that aren\\u2019t taking great care of our vets, okay? \\u201cYou\\u2019re fired. Get out. You\\u2019re fired. Out.\\u201d We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdad. We took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani. He\\u2019s dead. He\\u2019s dead.I withdrew from last administration\\u2019s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I kept my promise, recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. I was signing a sheet of paper, you\\u2019ve heard this story, $1.1 billion. I said, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this for?\\u201d They said, \\u201cSir, now that you\\u2019ve moved, we\\u2019re going to build an embassy in Israel, in Jerusalem.\\u201d I say, \\u201cHow much is it?\\u201d \\u201c1.1 billion.\\u201dYou got some friends of mine here, they\\u2019re builders. You don\\u2019t spend 1.1 billion on a one-story building. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on. So I said, \\u201cSo, does it have to cost so much?\\u201d \\u201cYes, sir. We\\u2019re buying land\\u201d So I called David Friedman. He\\u2019s our ambassador, he\\u2019s one of the most successful lawyers in New York. He\\u2019s a brilliant guy. He loves Israel. Right? Love Israel.I call him. He\\u2019s the ambassador, he\\u2019s there. I said, \\u201cDavid, they want to spend 1.1 billion on a damn one-story embassy. It\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWould you take a look? Maybe we own some land.\\u201d We own a lot of land. We\\u2019ve been there a long time. Calls me back. He said, \\u201cLet me take a look at it, sir.\\u201d He calls me the next day. \\u201cSir, we have a great piece of land, a much better location that we were going to way overpay for, a much bigger piece. We have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great.\\u201dI said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fantastic, David. How much will it cost to renovate the building?\\u201d \\u201cI think we can do it for $190,000.\\u201d So I said, \\u201cDavid,\\u201d it\\u2019s the first time I\\u2019ve ever done it. I said, \\u201cDavid, it\\u2019s too cheap. You got to spend more than that.\\u201dSo a friend of mine, Ron Baron, he\\u2019s got an office building, and he\\u2019s got Jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building, Jerusalem stone. And every time I go in, he goes, \\u201cOh, you got to see Jerusalem stone.\\u201d And he paid a fortune for it. He\\u2019s so proud of it. He doesn\\u2019t talk about anything but his Jerusalem stone.I said, \\u201cDavid, do me a favor. You\\u2019re I Jerusalem. Right?\\u201d \\u201cYes.\\u201d \\u201cDo they have Jerusalem stone?\\u201d \\u201cThey got so much, we don\\u2019t know what to do with it.\\u201d I said, \\u201cUse all Jerusalem stone when you\\u2019re rebuilding the building, when you do your renovation. Everything, wrap it in Jerusalem stone.\\u201dSo I think we ended up spending, to fix up the building, like $500,000. Can you believe it? We were going to spend 1.1 billion, and by the way, it would never get built. It wouldn\\u2019t be built in 20 years from now. And they like it so much, they gave up the plan. They think this is better. It\\u2019s a better location, it\\u2019s probably a better building.But I could tell you stories like that all night long, the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost, and then they use the electric catapults. You\\u2019ve heard that. Right? They don\\u2019t want to use steam. Why? Because it\\u2019s too simple, because it works, because it\\u2019s better. So they go to electric catapults that they\\u2019re working on for years now.Elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic. Magnets. It sounds good. Trust me, it doesn\\u2019t work. One little glass of water. We\\u2019re in the ocean. One little glass of water, boom, those magnets are gone. I could have told them that. I actually asked the architect, \\u201d Have you ever built a ship before?\\u201d It\\u2019s unbelievable.You heard the story last night about Air Force One. It saved a lot of money. I said to Boeing, \\u201cNo. It\\u2019s got to have a three in front of it.\\u201d They were going to buy Air Force One, 5.7 billion. It\\u2019s a lot of money, but look, it\\u2019s a helluva a deal. It\\u2019s a helluva a plane. What can I tell you.I said, \\u201cHow much is the new plane?\\u201d It was signed by Obama. \\u201c5.7 billion, sir.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a lot of money.\\u201d It\\u2019s actually two planes. Air Force One is two planes. I\\u2019ll give you a little. They\\u2019re going to say, \\u201cThat\\u2019s classified information.\\u201d Well, they\\u2019ve been flying around with two planes for 30 years, so I assume somebody knows. And our Air Force One is 31 years old. Right? So, look, it\\u2019s time. A lot of the Arab sheiks come in. I see their plane. They have a brand new one. I say, \\u201cWhat do we have?\\u201d 31 years, and we\\u2019re protecting them. Why the hell don\\u2019t we have a new one?So they finally had, at 31 years old. The new one is totally different, 747. It\\u2019s much longer, bigger wingspan, much more beautiful. It\\u2019s modern, it\\u2019s beautiful. 5.7 billion. So I said to the head of Boeing, nice guy, Dennis, this was before they had their difficulty, which is terrible what happened to them, but I said to him, \\u201cDennis, I\\u2019m not going to spend $5.7 billion on a plane. I\\u2019m not going to do it. I won\\u2019t do it. It\\u2019s too much.\\u201d I said last night, I told this story, first time, I said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s got to have a three on it.\\u201d He said, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t do it. No.\\u201dHe called me up the following day, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take 200 million off.\\u201d Somebody said, \\u201cWell, what are you losing?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNothing. In fact, we\\u2019re gaining a generator.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYou got to build an extra generator.\\u201d He said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll take 200 million off.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNope.\\u201dI said to the general in charge, I said, \\u201cGeneral, can we break the deal?\\u201d \\u201cYes, sir, we can. We have a cancellation clause.\\u201d \\u201cGood. General, execute your cancellation clause. We\\u2019re not going to buy it. I\\u2019m not going to pay $5.7 billion for Air Force One. I\\u2019m not doing it.\\u201d He said, \\u201cYes, sir. I\\u2019m very proud of this clause.\\u201d \\u201cWhy? Why?\\u201d \\u201cBecause we have the right to cancel.\\u201d \\u201cWell, do we have to pay anything?\\u201d \\u201cYes, sir, $250 million.\\u201dI said, \\u201cGeneral, don\\u2019t cancel it. Take it back. Just tell them we don\\u2019t like the plane. Okay?\\u201d And I couldn\\u2019t even say, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to buy it from Europe.\\u201d The only competitor is Europe. I can\\u2019t say, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll buy it from Europe.\\u201d No, that doesn\\u2019t work out to well. So I said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it. I don\\u2019t want to send them a check.\\u201d 250 million for nothing. Right? We don\\u2019t want to do it. So I said, \\u201cJust tell them, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t like it. The price is too high. We\\u2019re not going to buy it.\\u201d But don\\u2019t send anything, don\\u2019t put it in writing. Please, general.\\u201d \\u201cYes, sir.\\u201d \\u201cThank you.\\u201dSo about a week later, the head of Boeing called me up. He said, \\u201cLook, we can get it down, but you\\u2019re asking for too much.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t understand. It has to have a three on it, not a four, but three.\\u201d So another months goes by. I forgot about it. I get a call from Boeing, \\u201cWould 3.9 billion be okay?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s got a three on it.\\u201d True. True story.True story, and then somebody said \\u2026 it\\u2019s true though, somebody said, \\u201cWell, it must be a different plane.\\u201d Yeah. I said, \\u201cYeah, we have a much nicer paint job.\\u201d We have a much nicer paint job, you know that, and it actually got an extra generator put on. Okay? So it\\u2019s actually more. They said, \\u201cwell, we could use an extra generator.\\u201d I said, \\u201cIs there anything else you need?\\u201d They said, \\u201cSir, we could use an extra generator.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll get it for you, we\\u2019ll get it.\\u201d So I had it included in the price.These people know exactly what I\\u2019m talking about. It\\u2019s called included in the price. But think of it, there\\u2019s hundreds of deals like that. But you\\u2019re one person, and that\\u2019s why I got Mark Meadows involved, because he\\u2019s from North Carolina. He\\u2019s from North Carolina, and he\\u2019s cheap as hell. I need some cheap people. Oh, there\\u2019s many, hundreds and hundreds of stories. I could tell you so much. It\\u2019s crazy.The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country. It would destroy your Social Security and protections for preexisting conditions, it will. He\\u2019s going to drain your Medicare by giving away our healthcare to illegal immigrants. And I will tell you this, you\\u2019re going to have socialized medicine. That\\u2019s as sure as you\\u2019re there. And Obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. It was a lie. Said it 28 times, that we have, but it was a lie. But now you\\u2019re really losing your doctor. You\\u2019re going to have socialized medicine. Eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million Americans who love their healthcare. They have the best in the world.His running mate sponsored the socialist takeover of healthcare. You saw that. He wants to ban private insurance. You\\u2019re going to lose \\u2026 180 million people are going to lose their healthcare under this Biden character, and he has no clue. They\\u2019re going to take it away from him. They\\u2019re going to be running him ragged. \\u201cSign this. Sign this.\\u201d \\u201cOkay. What is it?\\u201d \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t matter. Just sign it, President, right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m getting tired. I\\u2019d like to rest, I\\u2019d like to let Kamala take over as president.\\u201dThat\\u2019s no way to get into the office, because we\\u2019re going to have a woman president someday, but you know what? It can\\u2019t be Kamala. Kamala. Nobody treated him worse, and he picked her. I\\u2019ll tell you, I was \\u2026 brilliant forecast. He could never pick her. She called him a racist. Right? She talked about Me Too-ing him. He was going to be Me Too-ed. Right? Me-Too-ed. A lot of bad things. There was nobody.Think of it, even Pocahontas treated him better. She knocked the hell out of Bloomberg, but she left him sort of alone. I think she felt sorry for him. I heard she felt sorry for him. I don\\u2019t want people to feel sorry for our president. I want other people, really, to feel sorry for themselves, because we have somebody that knows what they\\u2019re doing. We can\\u2019t have it.We can joke, we can play games, we can have fun. You can\\u2019t have this guy as your president. You can\\u2019t have him. Maybe I\\u2019ll sign an executive order. You cannot have him as your president. No, but you know this. Everybody knows this. And you know what? People are going to vote for him because they feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for him too. I feel sorry for him. And maybe he\\u2019ll show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate. Who the hell knows? I don\\u2019t know. But you know. You see the condition he\\u2019s in. You can\\u2019t have him as your president. And you know what? You can\\u2019t have her as your vice president, potentially going to be president. And that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re pushing so hard, because they know he\\u2019s going to be out very soon, and she\\u2019s going to take over. And she is the furthest left person of anybody. She is rated, not by me, she is rated further left than even Bernie Sanders. Okay? He\\u2019s second, she\\u2019s first.And just in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world, and we will end our reliance on China and other countries once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of North Carolina. By the way, get out and vote, please. Okay? [ 01:56:26].We will hire more police. Thank you, sheriffs. Thank you, sheriffs. I love the sheriffs. We got the endorsement from all the sheriffs in Florida, everybody up in Ohio and Texas. We have the stuff, nobody\\u2019s ever seen anything like it, the endorsements from law enforcement. We\\u2019re going to increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defeat everybody that we have to, including the virus, but we will defend the dignity of work, and we will defend the sanctity of life.We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep \\u2026 You know this, right? It\\u2019s okay, right? We will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars. We will maintain American\\u2019s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. It\\u2019s about time.We will end surprise medical bills, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we\\u2019re doing an unbelievable job on, other than the fact that the drug companies are spending a fortune, because they don\\u2019t like me much.You will see drug prices, prescription drugs, dropping 50, 60, 70% in a very short period of time. Favored nations clauses. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You have to see what we\\u2019ve done with NASA. We\\u2019ll be the first one on Mars, I hope. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriot education to our schools, patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, and we will never change it, by the way. We will never change it. They took the word, \\u201cGod\\u201d, out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. I said, \\u201cDid they make a mistake.\\u201d Did they make a mistake. They didn\\u2019t for them. They made a mistake for us. We\\u2019re not going to put up with it. But we will keep, \\u201cIn God we trust.\\u201dFor years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. This is the most important election we\\u2019ve ever had. Remember it. We\\u2019re going to be a socialist country. We\\u2019re going to be a communist country. These people are further \\u2026 they\\u2019re much further left than socialism. These people are sick.So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Get out and vote. And watch to make sure they\\u2019re not cheating, which they will be. Early voting has already begun. Don\\u2019t wait. Get out and vote. We got to win this. If we win this state, we\\u2019re going to win the whole thing. This is a very important state.If we win North Carolina, we\\u2019re going to win the whole thing, because we\\u2019re doing well everywhere, from Wilmington to Charlotte, from Concord to Raleigh, and from Greensboro to right here in Fayetteville. We inherit the legacy of generations of North Carolina patriots, who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation.We stand on the shoulders of American heroes, who crossed the oceans, blazed a trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And you haven\\u2019t seen anything yet, haven\\u2019t seen [ 02:01:10].Proud citizens like you, helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, with your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, General?We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will America strong again, we will make America proud again. We will America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Get out and vote, vote, vote, vote.\",\n          \"Thank you very much.Now if you want to really drive them crazy, you say 12 more years.Because we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016. Let\\u2019s see what happens. We caught them doing some really bad things. We have to be very careful because they\\u2019re trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they\\u2019re working on, sending them out to people that didn\\u2019t ask for them, they didn\\u2019t ask, they just get them and it\\u2019s not fair and it\\u2019s not right and it\\u2019s not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion. It\\u2019s just my opinion. We have to be very, very careful, and you have to watch. Every one of you, you have to watch. Because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign and that goes to Biden and that goes to Obama and we have to be very, very careful. Have to be very, very careful, and this time they\\u2019re trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam. They\\u2019ll blame it on the Post Office. You can see them setting it up. Be very careful and watch it very carefully. Because we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. This is the most \\u2026 For a long period of time, I would say, \\u201cWell 2016, how special was that evening? Was that one of the great \\u2026\\u201d That was one of the great evenings but we have to be very, very careful and we have to win.Our country is counting on it. This is the biggest, this is it. Our country can go in a horrible, horrible direction or in an even greater direction and before the plague came in from China, that\\u2019s where we were going. We were going in a direction like we had never seen. The most successful economy in the history of our country, the best unemployment numbers in history for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, college students, bad students, good students, everybody. If you had a diploma, if you didn\\u2019t have a diploma, didn\\u2019t matter, you were doing well. Everybody was doing well and we were actually coming together.You know success brings people together, maybe better than anything else. Success brings people, so many times they say we\\u2019re divided. Well we were very divided under President Obama, very divided. People have no idea how divided. They didn\\u2019t talk about it as much, they didn\\u2019t say it as much, but we were really coming together and I was speaking with Democrats all of a sudden because the success, the markets were at an all-time high and by the way, take a look at what\\u2019s happening with the markets. Take a look at your 401k)s which you probably do every hour. Take a look at your stocks. We\\u2019re very close to breaking the record and NASDAQ has already done it. You know NASDAQ has broken the record I think 16 times already during a pandemic. Hopefully we\\u2019ll call it the final phase of the pandemic.Biden the other day said no he\\u2019d shut it down. He\\u2019d listen to some guy say and he\\u2019d shut it down. We just broke a record on jobs, an all-time record. There\\u2019s never been three months where we\\u2019ve put more people to work, over nine million people, and again, we\\u2019re just about ready to break the all-time stock market record. I mean you look at it, we\\u2019re just about ready to do it again and what that means is everything else is going to follow. Very small on Wall Street. Everything else is going to be there, the economy is coming up very rapidly, our farmers are doing well. Our farmers are doing well because I got China to give them $28 billion because they were targeted by China. I got the farmers $28 billion, 16 and 12. That\\u2019s why. So in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and all the difficulties during this period of time, but we\\u2019re getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success. Success brings unity and we were there, and then we got hit with the plague but we won\\u2019t forget that.I just want to thank the people of North Carolina because to be honest with you, I felt an obligation to be here. You have a governor is in a total shutdown mood. I guarantee you on November 4 it will all open up, it will be fine like most Southern states. On November 4, you know these Democrat governors, they love shutdown until after the election\\u2019s over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible for the economy but our numbers are looking so good and frankly I used to say a V and people would say, \\u201cWell maybe not. I don\\u2019t think so.\\u201d Some would say no way. We have a super V, you\\u2019re right. It\\u2019s now looking like it\\u2019s a super V. Our automobile numbers are incredible, both used cars and brand new cars, our manufacturing number is incredible. We\\u2019re putting a lot of manufacturing jobs to work that the previous administration said you\\u2019d need a magic wand. You\\u2019d need a magic wand for manufacturing jobs, I don\\u2019t think so. I guess we had the magic wand, that\\u2019s all, but again, we\\u2019re putting them back, we\\u2019re bringing them back. But think of your life just prior to the plague coming in. It was the best it\\u2019s ever been. Your state had the best numbers they\\u2019ve ever had, ever had, by far, and we had the best employment numbers also.We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere near that, and then we had to shut it down. We saved millions and millions of lives. We learned the enemy, we learned all about the invisible enemy, how it affects really people that are older, especially older people, the elderly, but older people with problems with heart and diabetes, with other problems, and we learned and most of the country is right now doing very, very well. They\\u2019ve done an incredible job and to have a man sitting on television the other day say, \\u201cOh I\\u2019d shut it down. Oh I\\u2019d shut it.\\u201d Like it\\u2019s easy, shut it down. By the way, when you shut it down and we did the exact right thing, we shut it down, then we reopened and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing now. We\\u2019re well into it, but \\u2026 If we didn\\u2019t shut it down at that point, we would have had millions of people dead. Millions of people.You see the numbers, the job that Mike Pence and the taskforce and all of us together have done has been incredible, what we\\u2019ve done, what we\\u2019ve achieved, whether it\\u2019s ventilators, whether it\\u2019s supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared. Many of the governors were totally ill-prepared. Nobody wants to say that but it\\u2019s supposed to work that way, federalist, it\\u2019s supposed to work that way. The governors are supposed to do it, and many of them did a fine job and many of them came back well. But most of them didn\\u2019t have the equipment that they should have had. Few of them had the ventilators which are very, very complex machines and hard to make and hard to manufacture and expensive and we\\u2019re right now making thousands of ventilators a month and we\\u2019re sending them, we have all we can use, our whole country, every state. We\\u2019re stocked, we\\u2019re stocked and I always say and I\\u2019ll say it again, there\\u2019s never been a person that needed a ventilator that didn\\u2019t get a ventilator.Every single person that\\u2019s ever needed a ventilator, with all that you\\u2019ve heard with how much they said we didn\\u2019t have again, I took over a country whose military was depleted and whose cupboard on this front were bare. The cupboards were bare. We didn\\u2019t have anything. We didn\\u2019t have a thing. We had very, very little and we did a great job. We haven\\u2019t been given \\u2026 And it\\u2019s not for me, it\\u2019s for the incredible people, the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses and yet you saw yesterday convalescent plasma, you saw remdesivir. You\\u2019ll soon see vaccines pouring out years ahead of what they would have been under a more traditional, let\\u2019s use that term because it\\u2019s nicer, a more traditional administration where they would have taken years to come up with this stuff. We\\u2019re coming up with it like nobody\\u2019s ever seen before. The FDA, Dr. Hahn I want to thank him, Alex Azar, I want to thank him. They\\u2019ve come with things and done things that have never been done in terms of speed and frankly in terms of quality. If you look at it what we\\u2019re doing and what we\\u2019re coming up with, drug companies are coming up with vaccines that are \\u2026 I\\u2019ve seen some results already, it\\u2019s going to be very, very soon. They\\u2019re in Stage III trials. It\\u2019s unheard of. We wouldn\\u2019t be there for two years if this were a more normal situation.So I just want to thank everybody for being here and again I felt an obligation to come to North Carolina. It\\u2019s been a place that\\u2019s been very good to me. You know we won a lot of victories here. I haven\\u2019t been doing this that long but I won every chance I had in North Carolina. I even stole a great chief of staff, Mark Meadows, right? I stole him from North Carolina, and he left Congress as a very popular guy. Could have been there for a long time if he wanted and he came in and by the way, you have a fantastic young gentleman going to take his place, he\\u2019s a fantastic young guy and he\\u2019s going to be a real star in the party. He\\u2019s going to be a real star in the party.So I just want to thank everybody from North Carolina and I do want to show a little bit of a difference because another state that\\u2019s been very good to me is Wisconsin and Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee and they didn\\u2019t go there at all, they didn\\u2019t do this. We did this out of respect for your state. We didn\\u2019t do this for any other reason other than respect for the state of North Carolina. Because we said we wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina and I think you\\u2019re going to remember that frankly on November 3. We wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina. So I did that out of respect, and if you had a governor that would have let us have some people. He actually told me this, we had an arena that holds 19,000 people, it was totally jammed, sold out, every hotel was full, everything, and I called him, he said, \\u201cBut we have a shutdown going on and according to the rules and regulations \\u2026\\u201d Now this is 19,000, he did say it. I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019ll deny it, but he said, \\u201cAccording to the rules and regulations, the most people you\\u2019re allowed to have in that room,\\u201d meaning that arena, he viewed it as a room, \\u201cIs 10 people.\\u201dI say, \\u201cSo Governor, so I\\u2019m at 19,000, you\\u2019re at 10. Can we work something in the middle.\\u201d It didn\\u2019t sound too good, so we really had no choice. It was a terrible thing but I felt so badly because you could have \\u2026 I mean economic development money, all of the things that happen, but we decided, I was with Ronna, the vice president, everybody, Mark, and we said let\\u2019s have our big deal, the roll call, let\\u2019s have it right here and let\\u2019s do it and I\\u2019m going to show up and I\\u2019m not going to tell anybody. Until a few minutes ago nobody knew I was coming. Nobody knew I was coming. But what\\u2019s more important than the roll call? You\\u2019re the ones calling it so what\\u2019s more important \\u2013Speaker 4: 12:52)We love you Mr. President. We love you.I have to tell you, we\\u2019re going to do a lot of things. I\\u2019m just going to go over very briefly because we\\u2019re going to make a speech on Thursday night, I hope you\\u2019re all going to be listening. Because I came in, I\\u2019m on Air Force One and Air Force One has more televisions that any plane in history. They\\u2019ve got them in closets, they\\u2019ve got them on ceilings, floors. They\\u2019ve got more \\u2026 You can\\u2019t escape a television, and I turned to CNN and they didn\\u2019t have this. They weren\\u2019t having it, can you believe it? They didn\\u2019t have it. No no, CNN didn\\u2019t have our roll call. Then I turned to MSDNC as I call it. MSDNC which is truly, it is a branch of the Democrats. It\\u2019s a I wouldn\\u2019t say fully owned corporation but it\\u2019s certainly a fully controlled or they control them, nobody really knows who\\u2019s controlling who but they had it on television. I remember watching it, it was interesting. You see the difference states and we say this and we say that, the great state of Alaska, the great state of Alabama, the great state of North Carolina, the great state of all of them, and it\\u2019s very interesting \\u2013\\u2026 Carolina. The great state of all of them. And it\\u2019s very interesting to me. They had theirs on, but they didn\\u2019t show it. Instead, they\\u2019re showing the scam because they\\u2019re trying to show the post office so that when their whole mail-in thing fizzles, they\\u2019ll try blaming it on the post office. Okay. So they show in these hearings that are very boring actually and they\\u2019re not showing you this either. They weren\\u2019t showing this. And Fox had it on, but unfortunately, Fox wasn\\u2019t showing it too much because they had the announcers talking, talking, talking. I said, \\u201d I want to hear what they\\u2019re saying, the delegates. I want to hear what they\\u2019re saying.\\u201d So I think we had to switch over to CSPAN or to OAN or somebody. But I wanted to hear them.But I can promise you a few things. Number one, we will not be taking the word, God, out of The Pledge of Allegiance. Okay. Like they did a number of times at their caucuses, so they took the word God out. I heard it. I was listening and I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s strange.\\u201d It\\u2019s sort of weird. You\\u2019ve heard it all your life, right? Under God, under God. All of a sudden, those two words are missing. I said, \\u201cOh, he must\\u2019ve made a mistake.\\u201d Maybe the teleprompter wasn\\u2019t working or his book wasn\\u2019t working that I have right here. Something wasn\\u2019t working. I must admit. But the problem was then the next day I heard it again. And I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not a mistake.\\u201d And then they immediately went into a mode, \\u201cOh, no, no, no, no. We didn\\u2019t mean that. No, no. We didn\\u2019t say if for the convention. We didn\\u2019t say it.\\u201d No, that\\u2019s where they\\u2019re coming from. That\\u2019s where they\\u2019re coming from. You can say it or not say it. That is where they\\u2019re coming from.Just like with energy, they don\\u2019t want energy. Not working well in Texas, by the way. I just looked at a poll. And by the way, it just came out that we have received 51% in the big and very important Rasmussen poll, and my numbers actually went up during the Democratic National Convention, 51%. So, think of it.Thank you.I love this state.Think of it-Thank you.I love this state. I like this place and you\\u2019re from all over the place. But this has been a good one for me. No, but think of it, so we\\u2019re at 51% in Rasmussen. Do you read about it? Do you hear about it?. You don\\u2019t hear about it. They give you these suppression polls, where they do registered voters instead of most likely. It\\u2019s supposed to be likely, likely. In other words, how about you, you\\u2019re likely to vote. But how about you, you\\u2019re registered, but I\\u2019m not voting. But see, under their plan where they send these ballots, you don\\u2019t have to want to vote. You get the ballot and then they have harvesting. They get guys to go, \\u201cDo you want to vote?\\u201d \\u201cNo, not really, but I have a ballot.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, good. Who\\u2019s it for?\\u201d \\u201cSleepy Joe Biden.\\u201d \\u201cNow put it here, sign. Okay. Could I have it?\\u201d And they\\u2019ll take it.In fact, harvesting is illegal in your state. They wanted to put a Republican, a fine man, a pastor, they wanted to put them in jail because he harvested. Now they want to make harvesting legal all of a sudden. They\\u2019ll put him in jail as a Republican, right? If he was a Democrat, they wouldn\\u2019t even be thinking about it. In California, they do the same thing. No repercussion. In North Carolina, you had a fine pastor, a fine man, and they got him on harvesting and they wanted to put them in jail. And now they want to make it all so that everybody can harvest because they know it\\u2019s not a good thing.So people that don\\u2019t want to vote are going to be sitting there, there\\u2019ll be making them \\u2026 If you talk about 80 million ballots, it\\u2019s 80 million, it could even be higher than that. I used to say 51 million, now it\\u2019s 80 million. They said, \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re a little obsolete with the 50.\\u201d I said, \\u201cAll right, what is it?\\u201d \\u201c80.\\u201d I said, \\u201c80.\\u201d How is it possible? Think of it, they\\u2019ll be sending them, they\\u2019ll be dumping them in neighborhoods. People are going to be picking them up. They\\u2019ll be bribing. They\\u2019ll be paying off people to grab some. This is going to be one of the greatest scams. And it\\u2019s common sense. This has nothing to do with politics. It\\u2019s common sense. Anybody, you don\\u2019t have to know politics, they\\u2019re going to mail out 80 million ballots. It\\u2019s impossible. They have no idea.Who\\u2019s mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Well, supposing they don\\u2019t mail them to Republican neighborhoods. That means they\\u2019re not going to get them. So they\\u2019re going to complain and the election\\u2019s going to be over. And then they\\u2019re going to complain. And then they\\u2019ll say, \\u201cOh, well, we didn\\u2019t get it. Big deal.\\u201d In the meantime, you might lose the election. This is the greatest scam in the history of politics, I think, and I\\u2019m talking about beyond our nation. And they act like they\\u2019re aggrieved. Like by saying this, we\\u2019re saying such a horrible thing. We\\u2019re not patriotic by saying this. No, we voted during World War I. We voted at the voting booth during World War II. The pandemic, we\\u2019re doing very well and people know how to handle it. Look at the crowds. They\\u2019re doing very well. It\\u2019s very safe. It\\u2019s going to be very safe. If you have an absentee ballot where you request it, we\\u2019re all in favor of that. Absentee, like in Florida, they have absentee is good.But other than that, they\\u2019re very, very bad. There\\u2019ll be millions of ballots. Take a look at New York, take a look at Virginia, take a look at New Jersey, all different cases. They just had one last night. Now they\\u2019re thinking about recalling certain elections that took place with mail-in, and these are small elections that are locally based that are easy to run, not millions, but thousands of ballots, thousands, hundreds of ballots. But these are small, and they can\\u2019t control it. They said 23% of the ballots were defective. What does defective mean? It means fraud. It means a lot of things that we won\\u2019t get into because I don\\u2019t want to be accused. You see all the cameras back there. It\\u2019s the fake news. I don\\u2019t want to be accused of anything. But what it means is they\\u2019re trying to steal the election from the Republicans, that\\u2019s what it means. In a very, very nice way, I will tell you they are trying to steal the election just like they did it last time with spying and we caught them, and that included President Obama and that included-Let\\u2019s be nice. Biden. This could only happen in North Carolina. But that included them and they got caught. And then somebody said, \\u201cWell, what are you going to do?\\u201d \\u201d Well, we can attack a president.\\u201d Oh, I see. If it was me \\u2026 They say we can\\u2019t attack a president. We caught him. We caught him cold and they say, we can\\u2019t attack. He was at meetings talking about it. And by the way, this was spying before and after. And I think it\\u2019s a disgrace to our country. I think we can never let that happen again. But now they\\u2019re doing something that in a certain way is more dangerous because it\\u2019s more effective. They spied on my campaign, you know what they found, nothing. But this is big stuff. This is stealing millions of votes. And it\\u2019s going to be very hard.Now we\\u2019re in courts all over the country. And hopefully, we have judges that are going to give it a fair call because if they give it a fair call, we\\u2019re going to win this election. The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election. We\\u2019re going to win this election.We\\u2019re going to win this election.I\\u2019m just saying we cannot have these live, we call them live, some people call them universal, I like the word live, these live mail-in ballots sent to everybody, including mostly people that never asked for them. Think of it. You\\u2019re sitting there, you get a ballot. Here\\u2019s the bottom line. It was just given that in the polls believe it or not because the polls try and treat us right. That\\u2019s why I respect Rasmussen because they did well. A few of the others feel the same way, and they did well last time. Those are the ones that I look at. The ones that did well last time and Rasmussen was very good.But if you look at it, every single vote that they have, every single vote it\\u2019s going to be looked at. A man is sitting, or a woman is sitting, waiting for nothing, watching television, has no enthusiasm. Because on enthusiasm, the polls are saying that I\\u2019m up by massive numbers, not just a little. I\\u2019m also way up on the economy, by the way, put at the top. Way, way up. But I\\u2019m up by massive, and when I say I\\u2019m up, I\\u2019m talking about we\\u2019re up. Okay. So if you could [ 00:23:10].But I\\u2019m up by massive numbers on enthusiasm. So our voters are saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m very angry about this. I\\u2019ll go to the poll directly and vote.\\u201d But that vote is the saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care if Biden gets in.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t have any enthusiasm. When you go to Ohio, when you go to Wisconsin, when you go to North Carolina, when you go to a lot of states, they have the Trump-Pence sign on every lawn. It\\u2019s all over the place, right? It\\u2019s all over.Indiana too. Indiana is great. Bobby Knight. We love Bobby Knight too. I\\u2019ll tell you, we love Bobby Knight and Coach Oates and all of them. They love us. And we love them. Indiana is great. Thank you. But here\\u2019s the thing. So if they don\\u2019t have any enthusiasm, so you\\u2019d say, \\u201cAre you going to vote?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not getting up to vote.\\u201d Okay. \\u201cI want to watch television instead of vote.\\u201d All right. But here\\u2019s a ballot. It just got to you. And he opens it. Oh, here\\u2019s a ballet. What the hell am I going to do with this thing? And then they have somebody knocking on your door and they\\u2019re harvesting. \\u201cHey, have you gotten your ballot?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I have my ballot.\\u201d \\u201cYou going to sign it?\\u201d \\u201cWell, if you want, I\\u2019ll sign it. Here it is. Get out of here.\\u201d That\\u2019s the most honest way of doing it, and that\\u2019s unfair.That\\u2019s unfair because now they\\u2019re taking all of that enthusiasm that our party has, and we have tremendous enthusiasm. I think we have record enthusiasm. We have a base the likes of which nobody\\u2019s seen, including these people. Wall Street Journal did a fantastic story this weekend, a fantastic cover story this weekend on the base. It\\u2019s an incredible base. Everybody here is going to vote everybody in our base. I mean, we have a tremendous base. They don\\u2019t. They have no enthusiasm for their candidate. Because frankly, Bernie Sanders, they have much more enthusiasm for him. But Bernie Sanders, excuse me, again, he\\u2019s the greatest loser I\\u2019ve ever seen. This guy can lose and be so happy. Hillary Clinton, I want to use nice language so I don\\u2019t want to a use certain word. It starts with the word S-C. I don\\u2019t want to use it because they\\u2019ll say he used foul language while in North Carolina. So I won\\u2019t do that.But Bernie Sanders got taken advantage of, is that okay, by Hillary Clinton, but worse by the Democrats this time because of Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren got out of the campaign one day prior to the Super Tuesday vote, Bernie Sanders would have won every single state because Biden won by a little bit. She didn\\u2019t do well, but she took thousands and thousands of votes away and he stayed. If you add just a percentage of those votes back, that means that Bernie would have won easily the nomination. And I\\u2019m glad he didn\\u2019t because he had much more enthusiasm. And he would have had a base, a much smaller base than ours, but equally, I have to say this, equally as enthusiastic. This base doesn\\u2019t like Joe Biden. They don\\u2019t like Joe Biden. I think we\\u2019re going to get a lot of votes. We did last time. People were surprised. Primarily because of trade because I know how other countries take advantage of us, and I understand that, and that\\u2019s something that Bernie Sanders people really feel because I understand trade. I\\u2019ve done USMCA now. I got rid of NAFTA, the world\\u2019s worst [ 00:26:33].China tariffs. I mean, China had the worst year they\\u2019ve had in 67 years prior to the plague. The worst year they\\u2019ve had in decades and decades and we had the best year we\\u2019ve ever had. But we took in billions from China. We never took in 25 cents from China, never took in 25 cents. China for 25 years, and not only Obama, for 25 years China was taken in anywhere between 200 billion with a B and $550 billion from the United States.I give them all the credit, number one for being smart and outfoxing all of the people that stood here and their representatives, but China, we built China. We helped build. We gave them three, four, $500 billion a year because before that, and before the World Trade Organization and they getting into it, China was flat line. China was \\u2026 It was after that happened. And then they took advantage of us because we didn\\u2019t have people that were smart enough to see. And by the way, Biden would be the worst of all of them because his son took out one and a half billion dollars and he gets fees on one and a half billion, which is millions of dollars a year. Give me a break. China will own our country if this guy gets elected. We can\\u2019t let it happen. We can\\u2019t let it happen.So, we have a big one coming.\\u2026 So we have a big one coming. And just to finish, enthusiasm. So they take the enthusiasm now out of the equation, because they\\u2019re going to go knock on everybody\\u2019s door. Here, would you sign this? Yeah, I\\u2019ll sign it. Nobody knows who the hell is signing it. And they now want to have it where the signature doesn\\u2019t have to be verified. That\\u2019s right. The signature doesn\\u2019t have to be verified. And then they\\u2019re going to play the game that we\\u2019re not patriotic. What they\\u2019re doing is using COVID to steal an election. They\\u2019re using COVID to defraud the American people, all of our people, of a fair and free election. And we can\\u2019t do that. And don\\u2019t let them give you the Post Office stuff. The Postal Service, they do a great job. Lose a lot of money. I\\u2019ve said if they charged Amazon and these companies doing that, a couple of dollars more a package, that Amazon has to pay, not the customer.You know what happened? Post Office would start doing very well, thank you. Amazon dumps all the packages. Why should we deliver it? We\\u2019ll let the Post Office do it and lose a fortune. So if they charged Amazon, now of course, he owns the Washington Post. So when I get bad stories in the Washington Post, I wonder why, right? I wonder why. But I just tell it like it is, right? I tell it like it is. We\\u2019ve accomplished more. We\\u2019ve accomplished more during the first three and a half years of this administration than any president in the history of our country. And I\\u2019m not even getting push back. I\\u2019ve been saying this for two years, for three years, I used to say for two years, for three years. But we\\u2019ve done more, let\\u2019s say just about. This way they can\\u2019t say, \\u201cWell, somebody won a war, or something.\\u201d Right? No, no. We\\u2019ve accomplished more than just about any administration in the history of our country. We\\u2019ve secured our borders.We\\u2019ve built our wall, which will be finished very shortly. We brought back manufacturing jobs. We\\u2019ve defeated the entire\\u2026 Defeated the ISIS caliphate and killed al-Baghdadi. We also killed the greatest, biggest terrorist maybe of them all, Soleimani. We killed Soleimani, right? And al-Baghdadi. We appointed 300 new judges. By the end of the first term, we will have appointed 300. It\\u2019s an unheard of number. That\\u2019s because president Obama was very nice and he gave me 142 openings. And historically, you get no open. When you become president. First question, you say, \\u201cHow many judges?\\u201d They\\u2019ll say, \\u201cNone, sir.\\u201d Because the other previous president, they want to\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very important thing, federal judges.We will have appointed 300, could be even more than that by the end of the first term. And I sat down, I said, first day, I said, \\u201cHow many judges do I get to appoint?\\u201d They said, \\u201cSir, 142.\\u201d I said, \\u201c100\\u2026\\u201d Because you know what? He thought that Hillary was going to win. Right? And the Republicans did not make it easy, let\\u2019s say. But if you have enough time, there\\u2019s not much anybody can do about it. We ended up with 142 judges. And now we\\u2019ve added many, many, and we\\u2019re going to end up with 300 and two great Supreme Court justices.And remember this, I\\u2019m saying that I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m demanding actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he\\u2019s going to appoint. That he\\u2019ll take them out, like I did. I had 25 and we\\u2019re going to take it out of that list. And we\\u2019re going to be announcing a list over the next couple of weeks with the judges that we had, plus we might add a few more. So you know exactly where we stand. He can\\u2019t do it, because he would appoint\\u2026 It\\u2019s not him. He has no choice. The radical left will demand that he appoints super radical, left, wild, crazy justices. Going into the Supreme Court, your American dream will be dead if that happens. It\\u2019ll be dead. And by the way, the next president\\u2026 So I\\u2019ve had two. Some presidents have had none. I have had to in a relatively short period of time. But I will tell you that the next one could have two, three, four, and even five.The next president. This is so important. This is so\\u2026 Whether you\\u2019re talking about life, whether you\\u2019re talking about second amendment, whether you\\u2019re talking about military, this is so important. We have to do this. We have to win this election. But we brought back manufacturing. We rebuilt our military. We wiped out ISIS. I mean, think of it. When I came, ISIS was all over Iraq. The Prime Minister of Iraq was in last week and he said, \\u201cI want to thank you for defeating ISIS.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNow, are you talking about me or the United States?\\u201d \\u201cYou, because when you came into office, it was a mess. They were all over Iraq and Syria, and you defeated them, sir.\\u201d I said, \\u201cGood. Tell that to the media, please. Would you do that?\\u201d And he said, \\u201cI will.\\u201d So let\\u2019s say he does. But we passed the biggest tax cuts and regulations cuts in the history of our country.We replaced the worst trade deal ever made, NAFTA, with a great USMCA deal, that\\u2019s going to keep our companies here and it\\u2019s going to be treating us very nicely. And I wouldn\\u2019t say the other two countries were thrilled with it, but they were happy enough. And we did that. And that\\u2019s another thing, they said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll never be able to replace NAFTA. You\\u2019ll never be able to get it.\\u201d And I got it. We got it through Congress. We fixed a lot of our broken and bad trade deals. We\\u2019re getting 40 billion now from Japan. We fixed a horrible deal that was made with South Korea. Remember, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\u201cThis will produce 250,000 jobs.\\u201d And she was right. Except unfortunately, the jobs went to South Korea, not to us. She said it would produce 250,000 jobs. And it did, to South Korea. And we stood up to China like nobody\\u2019s ever stood up. Between the tariffs and the trade deal, which now\\u2026 Don\\u2019t forget, when I made that the ink wasn\\u2019t dry before the China virus poured into our country, right?The ink wasn\\u2019t dry. So I view that differently than I would have, because it\\u2019s done very well. In the last week they had the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans. They are doing things\\u2026 They\\u2019re very smart. A lot of people, because they see my attitude. A lot of people would say, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to order.\\u201d They do just the opposite. I got a call last week, \\u201cSir\\u2026\\u201d In fact, Sonny Purdue is here. The great Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. There he is. Is that right, Sonny? I got a call. They ordered the largest, it was the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Twice. Twice. The largest order of corn. The largest order of soybeans.Here\\u2019s how smart, somebody else would say, running some country. They\\u2019d say, \\u201cWell, we\\u2019re not going to do business with him. He\\u2019s not saying nice things about\\u2026\\u201d China\\u2019s very smart. Instead, they order more corn than we\\u2019ve ever thought possible. Right, Sonny? Order more soybeans than we ever thought possible. And now I have farmers calling me up, \\u201cSir, we love China very much. Please don\\u2019t be too tough on them.\\u201d It makes it very difficult, Sonny, right? We do too good a job sometimes. We\\u2019ve achieved American energy independence. And we\\u2019re now number one in the world, by far.And I saw where these phonies, you know they want to end everything we\\u2019ve done. They want to end it. They want to go to wind. They don\\u2019t even know if they want to go to wind. I think they want to just basically close up our country, because they\\u2019ve taken away our strength, but they want to do something. But, there is no such thing. Solar can\\u2019t do it. I love solar. It\\u2019s all fine. Very, very heavily expensive. Very expensive. But they want to go to other forms of alternative energy. And I think that\\u2019s okay, except we don\\u2019t have them. And it\\u2019s not going to power these massive factories.And hydro, I love. It\\u2019s one of my all time favorites. Hydro, I love. I have to tell you. That\\u2019s the Great Dams. You don\\u2019t see that too much. You know why? The environmentalist say, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t build a dam there.\\u201d But now we can, because we\\u2019ve done-We\\u2019ve done things that nobody thought were possible. Like example, the Keystone pipeline. We got that approved. The Dakota Access pipeline. They were all bogged down, right? Right? We\\u2019ve got things that they said you couldn\\u2019t get done. We\\u2019re energy independence. And they said, \\u201cWe want to ban fracking.\\u201d No fracking. How do you think they\\u2019ll do in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota? Louisiana is going to love it. There\\u2019s no fracking. There\\u2019s basically\\u2026 They want no fossil fuel whatsoever. Okay? No gas, no oil, no coal. No nothing. Okay.So they don\\u2019t want anything. Now, they\\u2019re getting killed. Because a poll just came out in Texas. Texas wasn\\u2019t happy. They want no guns. They want no oil and gas. And they want no God. No God. It\\u2019s no religion, no guns, no oil and gas. I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re going to do too good in Texas. George Washington could come back from the dead and he could choose as his VP candidate, the late great Abraham Lincoln. And you\\u2019re not going to win the state of Texas if you have no oil, no guns and no religion. I don\\u2019t think so.Audience: 38:07)Nice work!I don\\u2019t think so. You\\u2019re not going to win too many places. We eliminated Obamacare\\u2019s horrible and very unfair individual mandate, which basically knocked out Obamacare. We knocked out Obamacare. We\\u2019ve protected your second amendment. So important. We\\u2019re protected the second amendment. We\\u2019ve cut drug prices, first time in 51 years, we got drug prices down. Now, I\\u2019m really doing it. I did a favored nations clause. Meaning, we pay the same price as the lowest country that has the best deal. The companies are going crazy. The drug companies. They\\u2019re taking ads on me. I said\\u2026 I went to Mark Meadows. I said, \\u201cMark, they\\u2019re killing me.\\u201d They have nothing but cash. Okay? Big pharma, they call it for a reason. There\\u2019s nobody that gives the politicians more money than big pharma. Nobody. Not even close. So I said, \\u201cWell look, if you\\u2019re not going to negotiate a fair deal, we\\u2019re going to do a favored nations clause.\\u201d To the top people, the biggest guys.They said, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t do that, favored nations.\\u201d Favored nations, because you know, we have countries out there that are paying a tiny fraction of what our people are expected to pay. So if you have a country, Germany or others, they make\\u2026 By the way, UK, all of Europe, Canada pays 50%, 5-0. 50% less. In fact, people leave our country, go to Canada, and pick up their drugs and they come back home. Can you believe that? This is the kind of difference. So I said, \\u201cNo, I want a favored nations clause. I also want a rebate clause.\\u201d A rebate, where instead of the money going to the middleman, who have to be the richest people in the world. They get so much. They get more money, frankly, than the drug companies. At least the drug companies make a product. So I wiped out the rebate, where now it goes to people. And I instituted what\\u2019s called a favored nations clause.And it\\u2019s very simple. You have that in deals. It\\u2019s whatever the lowest price in the world, we\\u2019re the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. So whatever the lowest price is that other countries pay. So if you have a country paying 25 cents for a pill and we\\u2019re paying $2.50 cents, and it\\u2019s not such an exaggeration, believe me, then we get it for 10. So what happens is that doesn\\u2019t work. So they\\u2019ll go up a little bit. We\\u2019ll come way, way down. So I said, \\u201cFavored nations. I want to pay what the lowest price is anywhere in the world. We\\u2019re the biggest purchaser, we want a favored nations.\\u201dThey had a heart attack. And then I signed it. They didn\\u2019t believe it. And now what they\\u2019re doing is they have ads, millions and millions of dollars worth of ads, that I\\u2019ve been horrible to the people because of drugs. And I believe in socialism. Socialism. You know why? Because some of the socialistic countries get the lowest price. So the only thing I have with socialism is I wanted to get their price. Okay. That\\u2019s the only thing. Other than that is our country will never be a socialist country.So we cut drug crisis. And you could get cuts. You could get cuts.You could get cuts as much as 50, 60 or 70%, maybe even more than that, on prescription drug prices. And wouldn\\u2019t it be a kick\\u2026 I\\u2019ll use this, wouldn\\u2019t it be a kick in the ass if I lost and sleepy Joe is president, and this thing kicks in right about soon, right? In 30, 40 days. And people wake up after the election. Boy, Biden\\u2019s done a great job. My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great-My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great president he\\u2019s been. He\\u2019s great. And sleepy Joe would say, I thought about that, but everybody knew about favorite nations, but nobody had the guts to do it. And I\\u2019ll tell you, I was called by many politicians, please don\\u2019t do it, sir. Please. I said, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d They don\\u2019t want to tell me why. I know why. Because they\\u2019re politicians and they\\u2019ve been helped out and I guess we have to understand that too. But the fact is that we signed a favorite nations clause and a rebate clause, and your numbers are going to come down 60, 70%. And I hope you remember that on November 3rd, because nobody but me would ever do it. The other thing I\\u2019ve done aside from very strongly protecting your Second Amendment, which was not easy. That was not easy. And by the way, they will take your guns away as sure as you\\u2019re standing or sitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and you see how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic they let them riot every night. We\\u2019re saying, let us come in and solve your problem. We will solve it for you in one hour just like we did in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right? Five nights, six nights, they have to ask us in. Let us come in. We\\u2019ll solve your problem. They\\u2019re almost used to it. This is the way our whole country would be if you ever let a thing like this happen, our whole country would be. So we protected your preexisting conditions, very strongly protected\\u2026 and you don\\u2019t hear that. But we very strongly protected your preexisting condition. So we got rid of the horrible individual mandate, which cost everybody a fortune and we strongly protected. Every Republican is sworn to protecting your pre existing conditions. It\\u2019s very important. You won\\u2019t hear that. You won\\u2019t hear that from the fake news. We passed Right to Try. We passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. We mobilized the largest response since the Second World War. We are doing an incredible job on the China virus, but I\\u2019m going to talk to you about that Thursday night. Will anybody be listening on Thursday night?And just very quickly, in the second term among many other things, we\\u2019ll continue with our military. We built the strongest military by far. It was depleted. A nice Marine back there. It was depleted like you wouldn\\u2019t believe. We have the best jets and rockets and equipment of any kind, tanks. Tanks made in Ohio. Lima. Tanks made in Ohio. So we\\u2019re going to create 10 million jobs, I think very easily, in the first 10 months. They want to raise your taxes. All my life I\\u2019ve heard as a politician, you like to lower taxes, right? This is the only election where somebody said we\\u2019re going to raise your taxes. They\\u2019re going to raise your taxes, quadruple your taxes. They\\u2019re going to add on to the regulations. There all of these projects that we got started that are great projects, they won\\u2019t be able to get built.So they\\u2019re going to raise your taxes. They\\u2019re going to raise your regulations, make it impossible to build a highway. It used to take 17 years, 18 years, 20 years, 21 years, long time in some cases, to get approval to build a highway, right? We have it down to two years now, we\\u2019re going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we\\u2019re going to know it very quickly. We\\u2019re not going to take 17 years. We could name highways. They took forever. End up costing a hundred times more and they\\u2019re not as good. Some of them go in circles, I mean, to get to a point. They want to [ 00:03:44]. Let\\u2019s spend 37 million to\\u2026 look, we\\u2019ve got to be smart. Got to be smart. We\\u2019ve got to win an election. Also, we\\u2019re going to create tax credits for companies that bring our jobs back from China and other countries and impose tariffs on countries that take advantage of the United States.They\\u2019ve been taking advantage of us for years and years, and I\\u2019ve already done it in certain cases. We have countries that tariff us and we don\\u2019t tariff them. So they tariff us. It\\u2019s very simple. It\\u2019s called reciprocal. They tariff us, we tariff them. We are going to fully fund law enforcement and hire more police. We\\u2019re going to go with school choice and we\\u2019ve made a lot of progress on school choice for every student in America. We\\u2019re going to continue to expand opportunities zones. There has been nothing better. Don\\u2019t forget. It was us, us together that got criminal justice reform done. The greatest thing for the black community, African American community. They came and they said, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t believe it. Obama didn\\u2019t even try.\\u201d And not only that, I got funded, the historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They weren\\u2019t funded. They were year to year. They didn\\u2019t know if they were going to be around for another year and they\\u2019d come in to the White House.And after three years, I said, \\u201cWhy do you guys keep coming back?\\u201d Well, it\\u2019s a year to your deal. I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not fair. So you have to come back every year.\\u201d And we got them longterm financing and longterm funding. Nobody\\u2019s done more for the historically black colleges and universities than Donald Trump. Nobody. Nobody\\u2019s done more for the African American community. No president has done as much as anybody since, I mean, since, and I say it, since Abraham Lincoln. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s true. Criminal justice reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. He\\u2019s a great senator, he\\u2019s a great gentleman. Tim Scott is fantastic. Opportunities zones. But think of it, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, the colleges and universities. What we\\u2019ve done has been amazing. But the most important thing is prior to the virus, the greatest job numbers in the history of the African American community, the Hispanic community and the Asian, as I said. So I just want to thank everybody. We\\u2019re going to get rid of our sanctuary cities as soon as we can so that they don\\u2019t protect.We put NASA back in action. NASA had grass growing through its runway. It had grass growing through the cracks of its runways. It was closed, essentially, just a disaster. Now it\\u2019s the number one space center anywhere in the world by far. You saw the ships going up. And for some reason, a lot of rich people like rockets going up. And so we say, let\\u2019s lease them our beautiful launching areas and let them send all the rockets, let them pay for it. But we\\u2019ll be landing on Mars. We\\u2019re going to the moon. We\\u2019re go into Mars. We\\u2019ll be the first on Mars. Let\\u2019s see if that happens. We have to do it. If we hear it\\u2019s going to happen. If somebody else is here, you\\u2019re probably not. But I just want to, again, thank\\u2026 I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You\\u2019re incredible warriors. You have incredible strength. You have unbelievable intelligence and patience. It\\u2019s a combination of both. I don\\u2019t know which is greater, the intelligence or the patience, but let\\u2019s assume it\\u2019s the intelligence. But I have to tell you, I think we have the greatest base of support anywhere at any time, any election and people are starting to find that out. They found it out in 2016. And I will be honest, this election, I believe we have far greater enthusiasm in this election. And we had a level that was a record because they still don\\u2019t believe what happened. They said, \\u201cWhere are all these people coming from?\\u201d Right? People that were great Americans that never voted, because they didn\\u2019t like who they were watching or looking. People were great, they didn\\u2019t vote. I\\u2019ll never forget, a Congressman from Tennessee came up. They do very early voting. Tennessee, a great state. And they had just started voting. And I was in Pennsylvania making a speech.And he said, \\u201cSir, I don\\u2019t know. I can\\u2019t speak for anybody, but I\\u2019m from Tennessee and I\\u2019ve been doing this for a long time.\\u201d He said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen anything like it. People are coming from the valleys and the hilltops. And they\\u2019re coming from the cities. They\\u2019re coming from all over. I never say, they\\u2019re coming out of the rivers. They\\u2019re coming along those beautiful war fields that we have. They\\u2019re coming from everywhere, sir. I\\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\\u201d But if other States are like Tennessee, you\\u2019re going to win this election. He was the first one to say it. He was the first one. They came from the mountains. They came from everywhere. He said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\\u201d And people they\\u2019d be having Trump pins and the hats. These are people that never were political people. They never wore a pin in their life having to do with politics. It\\u2019s been an incredible experience for me. It\\u2019s been an incredible experience, I think, for everyone. And I\\u2019ll tell you what, next year is going to be an incredible\\u2026 it\\u2019s going to be a great, great year.It\\u2019s going to be a year of tremendous success. We\\u2019re fighting off this horrible thing that was delivered by China. And it was by China and we\\u2019re never going to forget it and I let them know. We\\u2019re never going to forget what they did because you know what? We\\u2019re going to do great economics [ 00:51:42] best year in the history of your state, but we\\u2019re going to do better economically than we did last year. But we can never forget the 175,000 people, which will go up. Remember this though, we saved millions because if we didn\\u2019t move and if I didn\\u2019t put the ban on highly heavily infected people coming to our nation from China, that everybody told me not to do. Months later, they were saying we shouldn\\u2019t\\u2026 and then they all either apologized or admitted it was right. And Europe. I did Europe too, very early. If we didn\\u2019t do that, our numbers would be at a level like you wouldn\\u2019t believe.So, I just want to thank everybody for this incredible support. Be very, very careful. This is going to be, and I really believe this. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Don\\u2019t let them take it away from you. Don\\u2019t let them take it away. North Carolina, we love you. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m here. Thank you very much. Very special people. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you.\",\n          \"Well, we won Pennsylvania last time and we\\u2019re going to win it by a lot more this time I can see. Because four years ago we had a lot of enthusiasm, but we have more now. Even the fake news will admit that. They [ 00:00:23]. There\\u2019s more than we\\u2019ve ever had. Hello Pennsylvania. Thank you very much for being here in the rain. As we stand together in the rain, it\\u2019s supposed to bring luck and we\\u2019ll take it. Ah, my man. I just came from the Rose Garden of the White House. Thank you very much, and I love you too. I do. Thank you. Or I wouldn\\u2019t have done this. I wouldn\\u2019t have done it.But we\\u2019re doing well. Our country\\u2019s going to be stronger than ever before very soon. You watch. It\\u2019s happening. It\\u2019s all happening beautifully. It\\u2019s happening. We had to close it down. We saved millions of lives. We opened it up and we\\u2019re doing record kind of numbers, and we\\u2019re going to have the best year and we\\u2019re going to have a great third quarter, so thank you very much.I\\u2019ve just come from the Rose Garden of the White House, where I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a brilliant legal mind, an extraordinary scholar. You know that. Number one in her class. You know the professor, one of the most respected people, he said the greatest student he\\u2019s ever had. That\\u2019s pretty good. That\\u2019s a little better than Biden, wouldn\\u2019t you say? She should be running for president instead of \\u2026Now it\\u2019s a little bit better, academically, slightly better. Most important of all, she will defend your God-given rights and freedoms. She will. Judge Barrett would become the third Supreme Court justice along with over 300 \\u2026 think of this. This is our third domination. We have Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and now we have Amy, along with over 300 federal judges by the end of this term. We\\u2019ve confirmed to uphold our laws and constitution as written, and that\\u2019s a record.Joe Biden has refused to provide his list because the names will be handpicked by socialists like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC plus three and Ilhan Omar. That\\u2019s a great one. She\\u2019s a great one. Always complaining. She\\u2019s always complaining. Came here, things worked out for her. How did she come here? Does anybody know how she came here? AOC plus three. That\\u2019s a beauty. That\\u2019s a group of real \\u2026 They love our country so much.They\\u2019ve given power. The far left will pack the Supreme Court with radicals who will terminate the second amendment. That\\u2019s what they want to do, strike the words under God from your Pledge of Allegiance, tear down crosses from public spaces and force taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion. That\\u2019s what they\\u2019re looking to do.These left-wing justices will cripple police departments, protect sanctuary cities and declare the death penalty unconstitutional for even the most depraved mass murders. It\\u2019s unconstitutional. We will save your second amendment and together we will save our country, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing.That\\u2019s a lot of people. We have tens of thousands of people. If sleepy Joe came here, I really mean this, you know the little circles he fills and he can\\u2019t get them full? You have like five of them, those circles, those big beautiful \\u2026 Whoever does it does a nice job. They\\u2019re very round. But he\\u2019s got five of them and then he stands very far back and walks in. I mean, I don\\u2019t get the whole deal there. I don\\u2019t get it.We have tens of thousands. Somebody said 17, 18,000. Last night we had 35,000 people. You saw that in Virginia. We\\u2019re making a play for Virginia because we have a governor in Virginia, you know that, he wants to totally end \\u2026 All he does is talk about terminating the second amendment. That\\u2019s all he talks about. That\\u2019s all he talks about. In 38 days, we will win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We will win four more years in the White House. Right? Thank you.Thank you very much. Great honor. It\\u2019s a great honor. We\\u2019ve achieved a lot together. It\\u2019s together is what happened. Wait\\u2019ll you see the numbers on November 3rd. Get out and vote. Go early vote. Do whatever you have to do. Make sure they don\\u2019t cheat you too badly with those ballots.Did you see today? There was a big mishap with the ballots. Another one. This is every day they have that, Mike. Every day, big mishap with the ballots. One of them, New York has said, \\u201cWell, we\\u2019re going to change the system a little bit.\\u201d It\\u2019s a little late for doing that, isn\\u2019t it? New York wants to change their system. They\\u2019re going to work on something. Governor Cuomo, he\\u2019s going to work on something now. Well, the ballots are flowing. It\\u2019s a little late.Then in a certain location, you know the location, they mailed a thousand ballots out. Unfortunately they doubled it up and everybody in this Democrat area got two ballots instead of one. Then two days ago they found eight ballots in a wastepaper basket. Unfortunately, they all had the name Trump written on them. We were going to vote for Trump. They were military ballots, the military.Then they have a stream in a very good state and they found lots of ballots dumped in this stream. Look, look, this is not right. What they\\u2019re doing is not right. It\\u2019s all run by these ballots, the ones we\\u2019re talking about, whether it\\u2019s Pennsylvania, because we\\u2019re going to win in Pennsylvania. You got to watch, but you have a governor who\\u2019s in charge of ballots.North Carolina, Michigan, Nevada, all of these places, they\\u2019re all run by Democrats. They\\u2019re the ones that count the ballots. Does anybody have even a doubt? It\\u2019s just common sense. It\\u2019s common sense. We\\u2019re going to be very careful. We\\u2019re going to watch. You know we\\u2019re waiting for rulings from a great federal judge in your state, federal judge, about the constitutionality of the whole thing. They\\u2019re going to try and steal the election. Look at this crap. The only way they can win Pennsylvania, frankly, is to cheat on the ballots. That\\u2019s the way I look at it. That\\u2019s the way I look at it.They just had a big thing today. They said there was a mistake made on a lot of the ballots. They\\u2019re going to try and redo the system. Take a look at Iowa during the primary. Remember the first primary? They couldn\\u2019t do anything. It was all a mess. It was all a mess. Good job. Good job. Look at this guy. Good job. Good job. Hey, good job.That guy, he\\u2019s going home to his parents now. He\\u2019s going to be in big trouble. But wait a minute, wait, wait. He just opened his mouth and we had that gentleman in the beautiful blue \\u2026 Will you stand up? Stand up. Man. Are you in law enforcement because you were on him. This guy hadn\\u2019t gotten the first word out. That\\u2019s the kind of guy I want working for me right there. Man, great. That was just instinct. That\\u2019s called natural instinct. Some people have it and some people don\\u2019t. Unfortunately, most people don\\u2019t. That\\u2019s the problem.Under my administration, we proudly achieved energy independence. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Sleepy Joe Biden has vowed to ban fracking. That\\u2019s not good for Pennsylvania. You notice now he\\u2019s trying to pull back?He went to a place called Texas, no oil, no God and no guns in Texas. That doesn\\u2019t work. But you know what? Doesn\\u2019t work here either. You\\u2019re a big fracker. It\\u2019s a big business here, 900,000 jobs, but he wants to eradicate all of the things that you\\u2019re doing, all of the things that are bringing in so much money for your state. It\\u2019s a disgrace. Now he\\u2019s trying to say, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t really mean that.\\u201dThat was like Hillary. Remember? She made a horrible statement about clean coal and then she went, crooked Hillary, and then she went three weeks later \\u2026 I agree.All right. I used to say, \\u201cNow, now, now, we won, we won. Now, don\\u2019t do it.\\u201d But didn\\u2019t say [ 00:11:11], but I try and stop it. But now I, she\\u2019s crazy. Bill is stone cold afraid of her. No, but how about remember the emails? You think we forgot? We didn\\u2019t forget the emails. You remember the emails when Congress said, \\u201cWe want 33,000 emails,\\u201d and they deleted the emails? They deleted everything, the text messages, everything, they deleted. If Mike Kelly did that he\\u2019d be out of a job so fast. He\\u2019d be gone, right? He\\u2019d be gone. None of us, we wouldn\\u2019t last long. I mean the corruption.Hey, did you see though, over the last 48 hours, the FBI tapes, the FBI text messages? Trump was right. The one guy says, \\u201cTrump was right. He was right. You shouldn\\u2019t be doing this. Trump was right.\\u201d He was the honest one. But they brought him along. We need insurance. We have to get insurance for this. This is wrong, what we\\u2019re doing. Trump was right.It turned out that it was a whole big dis-information deal. You know who the guilty party is? The Democrats and Hillary, they were the ones that dealt with Russia. It wasn\\u2019t us, which we\\u2019ve been saying for a long time. No, these text messages just came out. Did you see that? They just came out.We went through two and a half years of a lot of work and they ruined a lot of people. Look at General Flynn. Look at what happened. Those messages about General Flynn last night just came out. They knew he was innocent. They said, \\u201cWe want Flynn in order to get Trump. We want Flynn.\\u201d They were after Trump. It came out loud and clear. They were after Trump.I\\u2019ll tell you what, we got to get back to Congress and go after these people. These people are sick. They\\u2019re sick. It was a whole big con job with shifty Schiff and the whole group. Shifty Schiff, he gets up and says a totally different thing than what I said, totally different. They say, \\u201cSir, you can\\u2019t go after him because he\\u2019s shielded because he made this speech.\\u201d He totally lied. He made it in Congress and he can say anything.See, it shouldn\\u2019t be the opposite. When you\\u2019re in Congress, you should be more honest. What a sleazebag he is, right? He [ 00:13:40]. What a sleazebag he is. What a jerk. What a jerk. We got to deal with people like that. I\\u2019ll tell ya. I\\u2019ll tell ya. How do you come together with people like that, they\\u2019re totally dishonest, because I want the country to come together. We were coming together until we got hit with a plague from China. We were coming together. I was getting calls from stone, cold, radical left, hard line Democrats, let\\u2019s start talking. I\\u2019m telling you, because we had the best unemployment numbers we ever had, the best economy, best stock market, although the stock market right now is just about there.Success will bring us together. Then we got hit with the plague from China and now we have to do it all over again. It\\u2019s make America great again again. That\\u2019s what we got to do. But we saved millions of lives by doing what we did.When they ask about fracking, sleepy Joe Biden said that he would make sure it\\u2019s eliminated. This was just a little while ago. Then he gets the nomination, he goes, \\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t think fracking\\u2019s that bad.\\u201d It\\u2019s amazing, isn\\u2019t it? That\\u2019s what you call a really dishonest, dumb politician. A dumb guy. He\\u2019s a dumb guy. Always known as the dumb guy.But we look forward to seeing him in the debate. He\\u2019s got a lot more experience. He\\u2019s got 47 years. I\\u2019ve got three and a half years, so we\\u2019ll see. He\\u2019s got 47 years of experience. I always sort of smile when he said, like [ 00:15:18], \\u201cWe should have done this. We should have done that. We should have,\\u201d all these things. I said, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you do them?\\u201d He\\u2019s been there for \\u2026 It\\u2019s not like he left 20 years ago, 47 years and he left three and a half years ago. Why the hell didn\\u2019t you do them? Now he went, it\\u2019s all these great ideas. That\\u2019s a real beauty.Days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions, which he doesn\\u2019t have any idea what that means, shutting down all fracking and sending you jobs overseas, like they\\u2019ve been doing. I\\u2019m bringing your jobs back. They\\u2019re all coming back. I\\u2019ll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong. That\\u2019s where they belong, what they\\u2019ve done to you and other States.Joe Biden\\u2019s agenda would also be a nightmare for Pennsylvania seniors. Do we have any seniors here? Don\\u2019t raise your hand. Do we have any seniors? Look how few people raised their hands? I can see some seniors. We\\u2019re proud of it. Right?For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know that. He wants to go \\u2026 You know what\\u2019s going to happen. They\\u2019re going to go with socialized medicine if they ever got in.Remember Obama, what he said? By the way, Obama knew all about the scam. He knew all about this coup. He knew all about spying on my campaign. He knew everything. Somebody said, \\u201cWell, we can\\u2019t go.\\u201d They have him [ 00:16:49], they have him Remember I said they were spying on my campaign a long time ago? The internet blew up. How dare he say that? It turned out to be true. Then it was the coup because I got in. Now they said, \\u201cAll right, he got in. We couldn\\u2019t stop him. Now we\\u2019re going to try taking it away.\\u201d Can you believe it? This is the USA. No, seriously, can you believe it? We caught them. All these text messages, and from what I hear, they have some real beauties coming out over the next couple of days, so [ 00:17:27]. When somebody said, \\u201cOh, you can\\u2019t do that. He was president.\\u201d Well I\\u2019m president too and they would not stop. I promise. These people are sick. They\\u2019re bad people.Remember when Biden said, \\u201cWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security.\\u201d He meant this. He said, \\u201cWhen I argued,\\u201d and he wanted to freeze all this federal spending, he\\u2019s not going to take care of your Medicare. He\\u2019s not going to take care of your Social Security. If he gets in, he\\u2019s going to have nothing to say because the radical left will control it and he\\u2019s going to do socialized medicine, as sure as you\\u2019re sitting or standing there. I don\\u2019t, I can\\u2019t even tell the hell difference. You\\u2019re sitting.Isn\\u2019t it nice we got seats for people? Who would do that? Look at all the police back there. Are they the greatest? Great guys. They\\u2019re great people. We got so many endorsements, I don\\u2019t even talk about them anymore. We have so many police endorsements. New York City\\u2019s finest, never did it before. They endorsed me. They endorsed us for president. They could solve that problem in New York. All they\\u2019d have to do is let them do \\u2026They could solve that problem in New York. All they\\u2019d have to do is let them do their job and don\\u2019t take a billion dollars away and fire some of the best people on the force, which is what they did. We got Chicago. Think of that. Chicago police endorse me. How about that? This is not easy to do. You\\u2019re dealing with radical left people. We got endorsed by all the sheriffs in Florida, all law enforcement in Florida. We got endorsed by Texas, Oklahoma. We got endorsed by\\u2026 Does anybody know of any police area or group that has not endorsed us? We\\u2019re looking for them. We\\u2019re looking.Now Biden is pledging to give federal healthcare to illegal aliens, which is decimating. Medicare. Just saying this, that we all have heart. We want to help people. But the problem is when you say that, people that never even thought of coming to the United States say, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d \\u201cWhere are we going?\\u201d We get free education. We get free Medicare free healthcare. And then I jokingly said, one time, \\u201cEverybody gets a beautiful brand new Rolls Royce.\\u201d And CNN said, \\u201cHe lied. He said that all illegal immigrants got a $750,000 car.\\u201d It\\u2019s true. They said he lied. I didn\\u2019t. I was only kidding. They said I lied over the Rolls Royce. You remember when I said, \\u201cRussia, if you\\u2019re listening, find her emails.\\u201d Or whatever the hell I said. \\u201cFind her emails.\\u201d And then we all laughed together. 25,000 people in the stadium on television. Look at all the cameras on television. Look at those people. Look at all those red lights that are going on. They\\u2019re standing in the rain just like I am, but they don\\u2019t like it. But do you remember? But the problem is they cut it off exactly before we all started to laugh together. Right? And for two years they\\u2019ve been saying, \\u201cHe dealt with Russia. He asked Russia to please get her emails.\\u201d Or whatever the hell we were asking for \\u201cRussia, if you\\u2019re listening, please get\\u2026\\u201d The whole place cracks up along with me. In fact, they cut off my last word. You know, they got to cut it short because they don\\u2019t want to see any sign.This is how dishonest. They are really, I\\u2019ll tell you, they\\u2019re so bad for the country. But I\\u2019ll take it back for right now. Because right now it\\u2019s live all over the place. We\\u2019ll let it go. You know what? Let\\u2019s say it at the end instead. Because so often I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cYou know, they\\u2019re CNN, they\\u2019re totally corrupt. They\\u2019re fake.\\u201d And you see the light go off there, the red light. I said, \\u201cI got to stop saying that.\\u201d Do you think it\\u2019s wet enough out here? They all said, \\u201cSir, would you need a hat?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat the hell hat is going to match this beautiful tie that I\\u2019ve just\\u2026\\u201d I got a red one. I don\\u2019t know, red and whatever the hell color this is. Red is not going to go well with this color. Nah, it\\u2019s fine. I like seeing the rain with my friends from Pennsylvania. I don\\u2019t care. We\\u2019re in the rain together. We\\u2019re in the rain together.Thank you. Thank you very much. We\\u2019re in the rain together. That\\u2019s all right. We\\u2019ll stay out here all night if we have to, right? But I\\u2019ll tell you, so many interesting things are going on. When I look at their plans\\u2026 Did you see their plans? The manifesto? That\\u2019s the Bernie Sanders and AOC manifesto. Normally when you negotiate with communists, because I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s\\u2026 Haven\\u2019t they gone over the\\u2026 I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s\\u2026 This is no longer socialism. We\\u2019re dealing with worst than socialism. This is communism. But when you deal with socialist communists, you\\u2019re supposed to bring them a little bit to the right, right? You\\u2019re a Democrat, you bring\\u2026 They started with a plan and they went further left. This plan is the most horrible. We call it the manifesto. Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. But you know the one thing they agree with us? On trade. Because we are being ripped off by so many countries. I\\u2019ve stopped a lot of it.I mean, I had to devote a lot of time to a fake impeachment. Now you see how fake the impeachment was. What about Biden\\u2019s son getting three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow? And then they say, \\u201cDonald Trump is dealing with Russia. Donald Trump.\\u201d I never even made a call. \\u201cDonald Trump is dealing.\\u201d This guy got three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. What the hell was that for?Probably his great experience in energy, but he didn\\u2019t have that. And then it revealed yesterday that he got a lot more money from China than we thought and he got a lot more money, right? It\\u2019s just all stuff. It\\u2019s like perfect. It\\u2019s like unbelievable. But he got a lot more money from China and the 100, the 83 or 63,000 a month that he was getting, now it looks like it was 183,000 a month. And he got an upfront payment of $3 million from Ukraine. This is because of his great knowledge of energy, but he had none. They said, \\u201cDo you know anything about energy?\\u201d \\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t happen to know anything.\\u201d Oh. And then the father called for the prosecutor, \\u201cGet him out or you\\u2019re not getting your billion dollars from the United States.\\u201d Whoa. They got him out and here\\u2019s your billion. That\\u2019s not a quid pro quo. Right?But a perfect phone call is a quid pro quo where nothing was\\u2026 It\\u2019s a disgrace. Well, hopefully we\\u2019re getting to the bottom of all that stuff because we got plenty. Biden\\u2019s plan for mass amnesty would bankrupt your social security system. You remember me when I got elected, they all said, \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s going to hurt\\u2026\\u201d They love to say that\\u2019s going to hurt because they give dis-information. They say a lie like the soldiers and the graves and they put it in. Can you imagine? No animal that I know would say that. Nobody. They make up a lie and then they go with it. Social security. They said four years ago. Now they said again. By the way, your social security, we never touched it. Not even touched it. They said he will destroy your social security. No. They will destroy it because they\\u2019ll destroy your country and your social security will be worthless. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s going to happen.In just three and a half years, we\\u2019ve secured America\\u2019s borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, obliterated 100% of the ISIS [ 00:07:07]. Fixed our disastrous trade deals and brought jobs back home to America and back home to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under 16 years of presidents, Obama and Bush, household income rose only $2,945. These are right out of the book. So 16 years, less than 3,000. In three years with us, it rose 6,483. So much less than half [ 00:07:42]. And if you include energy savings, how do you like paying those $2 for a gasoline and even less [ 00:26:51]? And your electric bill is way down.We\\u2019re number one in the world. How do you like that? If you include that, it\\u2019s $10,000. That\\u2019s over three years, three and a half years. We lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, which is a wreck. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now we are very, very rapidly\\u2026 You see the numbers. It\\u2019s happening all over again. We\\u2019ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. There\\u2019s never been a record like that. We\\u2019ve added more jobs than any time, four months, not even close. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II.They said, \\u201cHow did you do it?\\u201d I say we get an A plus, but I get a D in public relations because we were so busy working. When you give it to the fake news, they report it incorrectly. So I figured what\\u2019s the use of even dealing with it? We did a job, including ventilators that nobody had. We took over. The cupboards were bare when we took over. We pioneered life saving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Whoever heard of that? And Europe, which is having a big surge right now, they used to use Europe, \\u201cOh, look how Europe is doing.\\u201d We\\u2019re doing well. We don\\u2019t want them to have a surge. Europe has had almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. You don\\u2019t want to hear that. They don\\u2019t want to tell you that. Early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through operation warp speed. We will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time.We\\u2019re going to have it very, very soon. They\\u2019re very upset with the vaccine. They\\u2019re very upset with the vaccine because it\\u2019s happening too soon. They don\\u2019t want it now. Even though it\\u2019s saving lives, it\\u2019s going to save tremendous lives, they don\\u2019t want to hear it. They don\\u2019t want to hear about the therapies. They just want to get through the election. I heard one state\\u2026 Did you hear this? We\\u2019re going to open up our schools on November 6th. Oh. I told you that, right? Don\\u2019t worry about it, Pennsylvania. Your state\\u2019s going to be open like on November 4th. This was some idiot. And now they\\u2019re excoriating this person that said it. They\\u2019re excoriating the person that said it. We\\u2019re to open up out of schools in November 6 to latest November 9th. Oh, that\\u2019s nice. Got to open your schools. You\\u2019ve got to open up your state. Open it up.The ones that are doing well are the ones that opened it up. We will crush the virus. Our opponents will crush America. And that\\u2019s what it\\u2019s about. They will. They will deliver a crippling shutdown and a steep. You will have\\u2026 If sleepy Joe Biden becomes president, first of all, you\\u2019re going to have a massive tax increase. You\\u2019re going to see interest rates go through the ceiling. You will have a depression, the likes of which this country has never seen before. And I\\u2019m including 1929. That was a pretty bad one. All right. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s going to happen. I hope I don\\u2019t get a chance to be tested because I don\\u2019t want to be tested. I don\\u2019t want to have him and say, \\u201cSee, I was right.\\u201d Because with us, you\\u2019re going to have incredible prosperity. We\\u2019re cutting taxes and we\\u2019re growing fast.I\\u2019m delivering a safe vaccine in record time. That\\u2019s the other thing with the vaccine because of me and the FAA, they\\u2019re approving things in a fraction of the time. You wouldn\\u2019t have had a vaccine if you had to go through that obsolete process. You wouldn\\u2019t have had a vaccine for two and a half more years. On November 3rd, Pennsylvania will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity. Or whether we allow to sleepy Joe Biden to kill the recovery, delay the vaccine, impose a $4 trillion tax hike, destroy your suburbs. Everyone is talking about me and the suburbs. I knocked out the regulation that allows low-income housing in the suburbs. Then I hear oh, the people in the suburbs don\\u2019t like me. You better like me because you\\u2019re going to have\\u2026 Your suburbs aren\\u2019t going to be so great. They say that women in the suburbs\\u2026 I made the mistake. I said, \\u201cHousewives living in the suburbs.\\u201d They said, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s politically incorrect.\\u201d Okay. I got killed for that. I used the word housewife. Is that an unacceptable term? I don\\u2019t know.They\\u2019re all saying no. I said the housewives in the suburbs. And they said, \\u201cOh, what a horrible thing to say.\\u201d But women, let\\u2019s be politically correct, women and men in the suburbs, they\\u2019re changing the zoning so they can build. That\\u2019s what it is. They\\u2019re changing the zoning. It was a rule, a regulation that was a disaster. I called my people. I said, \\u201cI want to terminate it.\\u201d They said, \\u201cSir, we can\\u2019t do that. Let\\u2019s just amend it. We\\u2019ll make it much\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cNo, no. You don\\u2019t understand. I don\\u2019t want to amend it. I want to terminate it.\\u201d \\u201cYes, sir.\\u201d And we terminated it. We terminated it. But if you believe the fake suburb polls, I don\\u2019t think people in the suburbs know that I did that. I don\\u2019t think they know that I did it. They say, \\u201cWe want sleepy Joe Biden.\\u201d Why? Why do you want him? First of all, you\\u2019re not getting him. You\\u2019re getting this maniac who was falling like a rock in the polls. He picked somebody that he should have never picked. She was so bad to him. She said such bad things about him. I\\u2019m not going to pick somebody that says bad. Then on top of it, 15, 14, 13, 10, eight, seven. Then she went up back to eight. She had a big week. And then she went back down. She got out at one or two. She quit before Iowa, right? Then they had the Iowa primary. Because they used these crazy ballots, nobody ever found out who won. And now they want to use it on a scale that\\u2019s a thousand times bigger. 80 million ballots. 80 million ballots.They couldn\\u2019t count a small number, but now they\\u2019re counting. Then they had the race in New York, Carolyn Maloney, terrible, terrible Congresswoman. And they took it away from the guy that was beating her or would have beat her. But they\\u2019re missing massive. It sounded like they\\u2019re missing 1%, which would be unacceptable. 1%, you can win by 1%, right? You can win by 1/10 of 1%. But they\\u2019re losing\\u2026 Like there was one area I think 41% of the ballots were missing. 41. These people are crazy. This is going to be a disaster. And all I\\u2019m asking is people go out to vote. Go out to vote and stop with this nonsense because we\\u2019re going to be counting ballots for the next two years.I don\\u2019t want to end up in the Supreme Court, and I don\\u2019t want to go back to Congress either. Even though we have an advantage if we go back to Congress. Does everyone understand that? I think it\\u2019s 26 to 22 or something because it\\u2019s counted one vote per state. So we actually have an advantage. Oh, they\\u2019re going to be thrilled to hear that. I\\u2019m sure they\\u2019re trying to figure out how can we break that one? Biden wants to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in schools, right? To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We\\u2019ll teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. We are only getting better. We\\u2019re getting better. This is a healing for us. This is the most important election we\\u2019ve ever had. I\\u2019m telling you. I used to say like even a couple of months ago, well, how do you\\u2026 Like 2016, that was pretty exciting. Right? Was that exciting? Was that the coolest night? Trump is winning Florida. He\\u2019s winning North Carolina. He\\u2019s winning Pennsylvania. He\\u2019s winning Michigan. He\\u2019s winning Wisconsin. He\\u2019s winning everything. What the hell is going on? And people crying. They\\u2019re crying. The anchors, the non-biased anchors are crying. I watched an interview with a person on MSBNC. I don\\u2019t watch it much, but I watched because sleepy Joe was on. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cDid you see that interview yesterday?\\u201d And she\\u2019s very tough. Very tough. She\\u2019s very nasty. She\\u2019s feeding him, can\\u2019t answer it. So what she\\u2019s doing is\\u2026 \\u201cNo, no, isn\\u2019t it true? Isn\\u2019t it true that Trump is a horrible human being?\\u201d Well, yeah. As we discussed before, it\\u2019s true. This was the worst, most obvious\\u2026 And this was a killer. This person is very tough. It is so rigged. The whole thing is rigged. We got to beat the system, and we\\u2019re beating the system. Sometimes I\\u2019ll look and I\\u2019ll have somebody in the office that\\u2019s corrupt media person. And I\\u2019ll be sitting there complaining how unfair it is. Then I\\u2019ll be sitting in the Oval Office, but I\\u2019ll be saying how unfair it is. Then I\\u2019ll look around the Oval Office. I say, \\u201cWait a minute. It\\u2019s unfair, but oh, we\\u2019re in the Oval Office and you\\u2019re not.\\u201d I stopped complaining, Mike. They said, \\u201cOh, this is the Oval Office. Isn\\u2019t it?\\u201dJoe Biden has surrendered his party to the flag burners, rioters, the anti-police radicals, the anarchists. His running mate urged supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out riders out of jail, including an attempted cop killer. Let\\u2019s get him out of jail. 13 members of Biden\\u2019s staff donated to the same fund. They donated a lot of money too. We want to get these people out. We want to be called in. You saw what we did in Minneapolis. She called us like a week and a half too late. We went in. How long did that take? About a half hour. It was over. We brought in the National Guard. We told Seattle we\\u2019re coming in and they left that night. We\\u2019re all set to go in. I was so disappointed. I was disappointed.We were going to make a big statement, but we couldn\\u2019t because they said, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d They left. Shouldn\\u2019t have told them. Next time, don\\u2019t tell them. If you look at Portland, what a mess, right? That\\u2019s an anarchist. That\\u2019s sort of like a different\\u2026 Chicago\\u2019s a mess. New York, what they\\u2019ve let happen to New York. And we have these great police in Chicago and New York. They can do the job. Just let them do the job. It\\u2019s terrible. But you look at-The job, it\\u2019s terrible. But, you look at Portland. Portland is anarchist, and you had the guy two weeks ago, remember he shot and killed the young man in the middle of the street, just shot him like \\u2026 Oh, I don\\u2019t want to even say like what because his parents are so devastated. A young man and they shot him and killed him, this one guy, this one animal. Two and a half \\u2026 That\\u2019s right, over his hat. Not our hat, it was another hat, it was a Christian hat. It was a Christian hat, he was a Christian. He was a Christian, and they shot him, killed him instantly. This guy that shot him, everybody knew who he was, right? I said, after two days, \\u201cWhere is he? Did you arrest him?\\u201d No, we didn\\u2019t. After two and a half days, \\u201cDid you arrest him?\\u201d Then I put out on social media, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you arrest him?\\u201dYou know what, the U.S. Marshal saw it. They went in, and he pulled a gun on them, and 15 minutes it was all over. None of our guys were hurt, and he was dead. This guy was a stone cold killer, and yet they say he was a protestor. He\\u2019s not a protestor, an anarchist and a killer, and the U.S. Marshals, thank you. That was an incredible job they did, brave. But the U.S. Marshals \\u2026 We can solve that problem so easy, we\\u2019d put them in there so easy, but they don\\u2019t want, the governor doesn\\u2019t want them. The governor wants to leave it that way. Can you imagine what a messed up \\u2026 But many, \\u2026This is for years that\\u2019s been going on in Portland. I said, \\u201cWhat do the streets look like?\\u201d They said, \\u201cYou wouldn\\u2019t believe it. People put up 2 x 4 Sill fronts. They don\\u2019t want to buy new because they know somebody\\u2019s going to knock them down within two weeks. It\\u2019s a terrible thing. The Democrat party\\u2019s war on cops is putting our police officers at risk. As president, I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. You see how much the people love you? They really do. You know, you don\\u2019t hear that. You don\\u2019t hear that, but the people love and respect the job you do. You know, you don\\u2019t hear it because these maniacs right back there, they don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re writing. They do love you and respect you so much. So, thank you very much, thank you.That\\u2019s why law enforcement organization around the country, all organizations, that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re endorsing me and strongly opposing my opponent, and the radical left. My opponent, again, is controlled like a puppet by these people, by these crazy people. I\\u2019m proud to have received the first-ever unanimous endorsement from the largest police union in the world, the Fraternal Order of Police. The largest in the world, and we\\u2019re joined tonight by their president. A fantastic guy, friend of mine, Pat Yoes, and several hundred of their brave officers. Pat, come on up. Come on up here, Pat.Mr. President, thank you. You know, across this Nation there are some 800,000 police officers who put on a uniform every day, men and women who go into communities and place their own safety at risk to protect our communities across America. It seems like overnight people have turned their back on America\\u2019s law enforcement. We went from public servants to public enemies overnight because many politicians turned their back on us. You, Sir, have never turned your back on America\\u2019s law enforcement. So Sir, I am here to tell you that on behalf of America\\u2019s largest law enforcement organization, rank and file police organization, we give you our unanimous and enthusiastic endorsement, and we will not turn our back on you. Together we are going to make America safe again. Thank you.Thank you. Wow. Wow. Thank you very much, thank you.Thank you very much.Thank you very much. November 3rd, get out there and vote, and keep your eyes open if you see any shenanigans, which you probably will, okay? If you see people like dumping things, flushing things. If you see people dropping them in a wastepaper basket, seven or eight, right, wastepaper. Keep your eyes open. This is a smart group of people right here.Also with us are a group of warriors from Washington that are fantastic, that love you. We\\u2019ll start Dan Meuser. Dan, thank you very much. Where\\u2019s Dan? That\\u2019s not a very good location, Dan. It\\u2019s not like you. Thank you, Dan. Congressman Scott Perry. Scott. Thank you, Scott. Great job. These are warriors, I\\u2019m telling you. They fight as hard as you can fight, every one of them. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd. Thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. Thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. Great job. Congressman Fred Keller. Thank you, Fred. Great job. The great John Joyce. Thanks, John. A real good friend of mine, and somebody that I\\u2019ll tell you he\\u2019s as tough as they come, and he loves Pennsylvania, Mike Kelly. Thank you, Mike.Do you like having these guys by your side? Also, a man, sort of a legend I would say around here. He told me a long time ago, four years ago he told me, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to win.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHow do you know?\\u201d He said, \\u201cI know, I know. I can tell.\\u201d He said, \\u201cI see people with Trump stuff on that never cared about a politician in their life. Now they\\u2019ve got the hat, and the sash, and the belt, and the shoes.\\u201d He said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen \\u2026\\u201d He called it a long time ago. Former Congressman. We\\u2019ve got to get him back in, I guess. Well, he left because he had a lot of good things to do, but he\\u2019s fantastic. Oh, we got to get him back, Lou Barletta. Great guy. We have a congressional candidate who I hear is leading, Jim Bognet. Where\\u2019s Jim? Jim, I hear you\\u2019re leading, Jim. We\\u2019ll get involved. You have my total endorsement, okay. You know that. Total endorsement for Jim? My Pennsylvania Campaign Chair, Bernie Comfort. Bernie, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bernie. Great job. What a great job, huh? Wow. Have you done a job? Thank you. How are we doing by the way, Bernie?You have done it. Thank you very much. Also, state GOP Chairman, a friend of mine for a long time, Lawrence Tabas. Lawrence, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That\\u2019s a great group of people. Thank you all. We\\u2019re going to have a big victory. Lawrence, you agree with Bernie, right? I think we\\u2019re going to have a big, big victory, bigger than even four years ago. That was good. Remember they wouldn\\u2019t announce it. We were like a point up, which some people say is a lot. I think we\\u2019ll do a lot better this time, because at that time I said I was going to do things but, you know, a lot of people say things. Now I\\u2019ve accomplished more than I ever said I would in the campaign, so it\\u2019s different.I think we\\u2019re going to have the kind of numbers that people are going to be very surprised at. We\\u2019ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over his 47 years in politics, along with his other friends. He championed every globalist betrayal of Pennsylvania for almost half a century. He supported NAFTA. I got rid of that one. South Korea, renegotiated that one. TPP, got out of that one. China\\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization which he said was a wonderful thing. No it wasn\\u2019t, it was a terrible thing. That\\u2019s when China took off like a rocket ship, but you know what, China was going to overtake us. For 10 years they said, \\u201c2019, 2019, they\\u2019re going to overtake \\u2026\\u201d Guess what, we way outdid them in \\u201918 and \\u201919, and we picked up.If you have somebody smart, you got to have somebody smart, but if you have somebody smart in this position, your President, they\\u2019ll never overtake you. They\\u2019ll never ever \\u2026 They have more people but they\\u2019ll never overtake you if you have somebody smart. Biden\\u2019s NAFTA and China deals wiped out one-third of your state\\u2019s manufacturing jobs. You know that better than anybody. Biden shouldn\\u2019t be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness. That\\u2019s a little hokey, little hokey, but [ 00:48:24].In a true sense this election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, or whatever state we\\u2019re talking about and China, but we\\u2019re doing well. You know, it\\u2019s interesting, we signed a great deal. The farmers have done more business in the last two or three weeks. Biggest corn orders ever. The biggest soybean, biggest cattle, biggest beef orders. But, you know, it doesn\\u2019t mean as much to me. The ink wasn\\u2019t even dry and the plague came over. Am I right? It wasn\\u2019t even dry, it just doesn\\u2019t mean what it would have meant. We made a great deal but it doesn\\u2019t mean the same anymore, because they could have stopped it from coming here. If Biden wins, China wins, and where\\u2019s Hunter wins. Where\\u2019s Hunter? Where\\u2019s Hunter?He\\u2019s a guy walks into China walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage, and the most sophisticated guys in Wall street, I know I\\u2019m this smart, they can\\u2019t do that, and it took him 10 minutes, walked out with a billion and a half dollars to manage. You make millions of dollars a year on that. When we win, Pennsylvania wins, and America wins, and that\\u2019s what\\u2019s happening. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars in areas and countries that you\\u2019d never even heard of, and defending foreign borders. Now we\\u2019re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.Now our opponents are pledging to rejoin the job-killing Paris Climate Accord, a disaster for our country. It was meant to hurt us, it was meant really to take advantage of us. We would have spent trillions of dollars. You would have ended up closing a lot of your plants and factories. I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to do this, I\\u2019m going to get out of this crazy deal,\\u201d and I did. I said, \\u201cOh, they\\u2019re going to kill me.\\u201d You know what, the people got it. They understood it. It was ripping off our country, because we have things that they don\\u2019t have, like unbelievable wealth under our ground. They don\\u2019t want us to use it. Oh, that\\u2019s nice, that\\u2019s a wonderful thing. Thank you very much. I withdrew from that catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pennsylvania, not for Paris. We\\u2019re putting America first. It\\u2019s been a long time, right? From day one I put America first. To defend our workers I imposed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I saved our auto industry by withdrawing from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have killed \\u2026What I\\u2019ve done for Michigan, in particular, also Pennsylvania, but what I\\u2019ve done for them with autos, forget it. They\\u2019re building 17, or expanding 17, different plants. They hadn\\u2019t built one in 42 years and we\\u2019re building a lot of them. We have countries, you want to do business with us, go in and build auto plants. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, which is great. You\\u2019re not going to be losing companies to Mexico and Canada, very disadvantageous for them to do that. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China\\u2019s rampant theft of Pennsylvania\\u2019s jobs. I proudly signed the historic Executive Order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American.Now, I watched Biden two weeks ago. What\\u2019s going on? This lid, do you know what a lid is? He keeps putting, Bernie, keeps putting a lid. He\\u2019s got a lid. It\\u2019s 8:00 o\\u2019clock in the morning. Now a lid means you\\u2019re out for the day. That means the fake news media can go home. You know, he\\u2019s got one \\u2026 Isn\\u2019t that the easiest job I\\u2019ve ever seen, they never have to work. The media, please go home. There won\\u2019t be any activity from sleepy Joe Biden today. He\\u2019s a low-energy individual. Now, you need a president with a lot of energy. You deal with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. Remember we\\u2019re going to be in a war with North Korea, right? What happened? What happened to the war? A lot happened? We didn\\u2019t do anything, say anything. We didn\\u2019t do anything but millions of people could have been killed in that nuclear war, it probably would have been nuclear. But look at it. You know, getting along with these foreign nations is not a bad thing. They say, \\u201cOh, he gets along.\\u201d Yeah.I asked Obama, I was sitting \\u2026 He told me the biggest problem we had was North Korea, and he was telling me why. He was telling me lots of horror stories. I said, \\u201cUh, excuse me, have you ever tried calling him?\\u201d I got nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? One is for Israel and Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, right? By the way, many countries are coming and they\\u2019re all calling now. \\u201cWe want to come in.\\u201d They\\u2019re going to all come in. No more blood in the sand. No, we just did it smart. We reversed it. The art of the deal. It\\u2019s the art of common sense, let me tell you. We reversed it, and many countries are going to come in.I told this story the other night. Then I got one for Kosovo and Serbia. They\\u2019ve been killing each other for many years, just killing each other. They don\\u2019t get along, they don\\u2019t. They\\u2019re sort of like the Palestinians and Israel. So, I have two, I have Kosovo and \\u2026 You know, we\\u2019re dealing with both of them. I said to them, \\u201cWhy are you fighting and killing each other?\\u201d They have a lot of differences, including a religious difference, I guess. I said, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d We trade with both, so we have certain power. So I said, \\u201cListen, let\\u2019s get a deal. Let\\u2019s make economic peace, and ultimately peace.\\u201d They came to my office, the Oval Office, to sign. They were hugging. They were so, I mean it was a beautiful thing to see. We saved a lot of lives.I told this last night, I said to my, \\u2026 I said to my great First Lady, our great First Lady. \\u201cMelania,\\u201d I said, \\u201cMelania, First Lady.\\u201d I said, \\u201cFirst Lady, Oh, I\\u2019ve got to watch television tonight. I\\u2019m going to come home early,\\u201d because let me tell you 6:30 is very early. I stay in there late. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to come home early. I\\u2019m going to show you what a great job. I just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and we\\u2019re going to sit there and I\\u2019m going to just soak it in, Darling. Let\\u2019s turn on NBC fake news, Lester Holt. Number two rated show, he\\u2019s number two, heading south. I find NBC to be worse than the other [ 00:55:58]. They spend all that money on their PR and I screw it up in one evening like this.When Obama got it nobody knew what he got it for, including him. Remember, they said, \\u201cWhat did you get it for?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d That\\u2019s how different \\u2026 We have to work harder. He got a Nobel Prize and he didn\\u2019t have any idea why he got it, and then he started dropping bombs two weeks later on some place that didn\\u2019t work out. It couldn\\u2019t work out because he had John Kerry negotiating, who was the worst incompetent. Now, it\\u2019s so sad that Iran, that horrible deal. That was a fast plane. That must\\u2019ve been one of the new ones we just bought. We have all new equipment, that was scary. If I\\u2019m the enemy I don\\u2019t want to hear that sound.I said to our First Lady, First Lady, turn on the television, turn it on, Darling. It\\u2019s going to be a big evening. I\\u2019d toast you but I don\\u2019t drink, Darling. I just don\\u2019t drink. Not so-I\\u2019d toast you, but I don\\u2019t drink tonic. Just don\\u2019t drink. Not so bad. So we turned it on and they did a story on the weather. It was raining heavily in a certain area, and they did a story on something else, something else, and something else. Then they went into another story, then another, and then they had a commercial that lasted for about nine minutes. Even though they\\u2019re not supposed to make money, they\\u2019re using our free airwaves for fake news. Okay. They\\u2019re using free airwaves. Think about that. We\\u2019re thinking about that. We\\u2019re thinking about that. Why are they using free airwaves to give fake news? So it came toward the end, I said, \\u201cDarling, I\\u2019m a little embarrassed.\\u201d But the following day, I got nominated for another one. I called her up. I said, \\u201cMaybe they forgot. So let\\u2019s go home and turn on the television.\\u201dIt was the same thing. They had another story that this time they\\u2019re cleaning up the rain. Another one, another one, another one, got to the commercial, never ended, kept back a little tiny piece. And I said, \\u201d They didn\\u2019t cover two Nobel prizes.\\u201d I got two in one week. Did you ever hear that one? For different things, totally unrelated. And my only complaint is I should have gotten about seven or eight, because if you knew some of the other things, some of the other things I\\u2019ve done them much better. I should have gotten seven.But the fake news never even put it on. And somebody had a show where they said the amount of time devoted to Donald Trump\\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, two of them, zero on the network, zero, than the amount of time devoted to something else that was negative for somebody in the Republican party. Like infinite. It is so disgraceful. They\\u2019re so bad, but we just have to keep on winning. There\\u2019s nothing like winning. Just keep on winning. Keep on winning.See now, they\\u2019ll tell that story differently. They won\\u2019t tell it as we do it in fun, because I understand them. You have to laugh. If you can\\u2019t laugh, you\\u2019d be out of here fast, right? Like Beto when he said, \\u201cI was born to run for president.\\u201d That was on a magazine. He was on a fake magazine, Vanity Fair, which is dying. That sucker\\u2019s dying. Boy, those magazines are going down fast. But he was on a fake magazine, Vanity Fair, I think. And he started saying about he had a good week, good week. And he started saying, \\u201cI was born to do this. I was born to run for president.\\u201d I said, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not going to last very long.\\u201d And about two weeks later, it was over. He was put in charge of taking your guns away, though. Bye-bye, you know that, right? Beto, Beto, how do you get the name Beto? He made it a little Spanish because his last name is Beto O\\u2019Rourke. Where does the Beto come from? Another phony deal going on there.To protect American workers during the pandemic, I suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened U.S. jobs, and we will always care for our citizens first. Biden\\u2019s pledge to terminate these protections and give away your jobs, under my administration, we\\u2019ve achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. And we are just finishing a beautiful wall. That wall 340 miles, 340. They don\\u2019t talk about the wall.They don\\u2019t talk about the wall. I got sued by Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy. I got sued, and I made one big mistake in the wall. I always say, \\u201cWe have to build the wall, build the wall, build the wall,\\u201d right? I should have just said very simply, \\u201cWe will not build the wall.\\u201d The money would have come pouring. They would have insisted that we build it. And remember, walls work. Remember when they said walls don\\u2019t work? Walls don\\u2019t work. They want to give us drones so we can watch the people pour across the border. Drones, put a drone half a mile up in the air. You can watch everybody come into the United States. No, remember that, though? They said\\u2026Well, but two things work, and I say it all the time. When you come up, when you\\u2019re a brilliant scientist, you develop a new chip, you develop a new laptop or computer, in about three weeks, it\\u2019s obsolete. It\\u2019s worthless, right? A wall will never be obsolete. And what else won\\u2019t be obsolete. A wheel. There\\u2019s two things that will never be obsolete, a wall and a wheel. Everything else is trouble. Now we\\u2019re up to 330 miles. We\\u2019re averaging 10 miles a week. It\\u2019s everything to Border Patrol because I got them in. I said, \\u201cFellows, could you give me a little less expensive version, please?\\u201d But we have a great wall going, and it\\u2019ll be finished very soon. But the press doesn\\u2019t talk about the wall anymore. They don\\u2019t want to talk. It\\u2019s not a good subject for them.Since 2017, ICE has successfully arrested half a million illegal aliens with criminal records, including over 145,000 assaults, over 40,000 sex offenses and 5,000 killings. I want to thank ICE. Boy, they get beat up. They get beat up by the media. They\\u2019re incredible. You would have\\u2026 Think of the hundreds of thousands of people they take out of here. Real bad ones, too. Murderers, killers, drug dealers. By contrast, Joe Biden supports open borders, zero deportations. That\\u2019s in the manifesto. And sanctuary cities that release violent criminal aliens. That\\u2019s what they are. They protect the criminal, not our people.If you want to end sanctuary cities, you have only one choice, and that\\u2019s vote Republican. You know how bad it is. All of these places that you\\u2019re reading about, all of them, they\\u2019re all Democrat-run cities and states. All of them. They\\u2019re all Democrat-run because they have no law and order. All they have to do is call us and say, we\\u2019ll be in, but they have no law and order. They have nothing. They\\u2019re all Democrat-run. They\\u2019re a disaster.We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military and launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the Space Force. And that\\u2019s going to be very important. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s true. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world\\u2019s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and others, Soleimani. I withdrew from the last administration\\u2019s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. They paid $150 billion for nothing. They got nothing. I don\\u2019t mind the 150. What I mind, they gave 1.8 billion in cash. What is one point\\u2026 That would fill up this whole area. Right? 1.8, plane loads of cash. That\\u2019s when I realized that a president is very powerful. When you can do that, send that money to a foreign country and no friend, it\\u2019s crazy.I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. You know who likes that the most? Evangelicals like it the most. You know that? Evangelicals love it. We were just with Franklin Graham and a lot of great people. They had a very successful event at the Mall today. I don\\u2019t know if you heard about it. It was great. Franklin Graham, all of the top evangelical and other leaders. They were great. They were at the White House ceremony today for the Justice. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of the endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East and it\\u2019s costing nothing, costing nothing. Not killing people, no blood in the sand. They\\u2019re tired of fighting, by the way, just in case. Even these people that like to fight, they\\u2019re tired. Nineteen years in Afghanistan, they\\u2019re tired. They all want to sort of relax, as tough as they may be.Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War. He backed the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, a total horror show. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for the United States. Okay? Not so positive. Now Biden is pushing the most far left platform in the history of our country. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. You know that.They want to go socialized medicine. Socialized medicine, go to a hospital and take care of yourself. Get rid of 180 million private plans that people love. He would terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. We won the travel ban, remember? And increase refugee admission 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. He wants to ban school choice and ban charter schools. Terrible. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America.A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and forever. About time. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, the Second Amendment. Right? Second Amendment.We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these endless, ridiculous, stupid, foreign wars in countries that you\\u2019ve never even heard of. We will maintain America\\u2019s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. You know, we rebuilt our military. You saw it, $2.5 trillion. We have weapons, I mean, just to talk about them, the likes of which no country has ever seen before, the power, the strength, the incredible talent and engineering. We have weapons the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are so far advanced over every other country, and hope to God we never have to use them.And when I got here, we were a depleted, tired military with great people, but we were exhausted. We had old jet fighters. Now we have brand new F-35s that are stealth. I asked one of the pilots, \\u201cHow good are these planes compared to the enemy?\\u201d He said, \\u201cWell, one difference is you can\\u2019t see our planes.\\u201d I said, \\u201cLet me ask you. I know too much about flying. That helps, doesn\\u2019t it?\\u201d He said, \\u201cIt really helps, sir.\\u201d The guy looked like Tom Cruise, but better. Tom Cruise, but stronger.We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars very soon. And NASA has become the preeminent space center again in the world. It was tired. It was over.We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our National Motto, \\u201cIn God we trust.\\u201d For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania.So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Most important election we\\u2019ve ever had. The most important we\\u2019ve ever had. Early voting has already begun, so don\\u2019t wait. Go out and vote. From Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, and from Allentown to right here in Middletown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is an incredible place. Our whole history, so much history in Pennsylvania. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. It\\u2019s where the army weathered it\\u2019s brutal winter at Valley Forge. Where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware, and where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg.This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers minded the call, worked the railroads, and forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you haven\\u2019t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, we\\u2019re going to keep on working. We\\u2019re going to keep on fighting, and we\\u2019re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.Thank you very much. Thank you, Pennsylvania.
